        "help_seeker_post": "I was diagnosed with schizophernia-form and anxiety for a few years already. Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?",

Should I quit my job?

Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24111\nHi Happie\nThank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.\nMay I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.\n(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:\nJob Insecurity and Mental Health\nI have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.\nImpact of Childhood Trauma\nChildhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.\nSupport Systems\nI am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It\u2019s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.\n(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:\nTherapy\nContinue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.\nFinding Meaning in Work\nSince you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.\nSetting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn\u2019t ignite your passion.\nWork-Life Balance\nSeek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.\nEngaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.\nConsider Job Flexibility\nIf possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.\nEvaluate Job Fit\nIf feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.\nMaking the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.\nHowever, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that\u2019s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.\nYour feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.\nRemember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.\n\n",

I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength.

How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey.

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing.

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down.

How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4. Practice Self-Care\nTechniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.\nRegular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.\nJournaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.\n5. Connect with Supportive People\nTalk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.\nIf certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.\n6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis\nIf you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.\n7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help\nIf you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.\nYour feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It\u2019s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24090\nHi Fiara\nThank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .\nWhile I can\u2019t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.\nUnderstanding your feelings\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:\nPersistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.\nPhysical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.\nDifficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.\nEmotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.\nSuicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.\nImpact of Past Trauma\nYour childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.\nSteps to Consider\n2. Seek Professional Help\nA mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n3. Communicate with Your Partner\nCommunicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when\u2026\u201d).\nIf your partner\u2019s behavior is affecting your mental health, it\u2019s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.\n4.

        "help_seeker_post": "Currently, I am in a situationship for slightly over a month. We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha",

I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha"

I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

Recently, Lucas got out of a long-term relationship that left him emotionally scarred, making him cautious about opening up again.

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms.

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24070\nHi anonymous393\nThank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.\nSome key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:\n2. Friends\u2019 opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it\u2019s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.\n3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.\n4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you\u2019re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.\n5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.\n6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.\n7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.\nRemember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24075\nHi there,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019re going through\u2014it\u2019s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you\u2019re experiencing is very normal, and I\u2019ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it\u2019s okay to feel both.\nIt\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It\u2019s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.\nIt\u2019s also okay to feel unsure\u2014relationships are complex, and it\u2019s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don\u2019t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.\nBe gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Trust yourself\u2014you know what\u2019s best for you.\nTake care,\nTommy\n\n",

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself.

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself.

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it\u2019s completely okay to feel the way you do.\nI\u2019m also in the process of job searching, and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.\nOne thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I\u2019ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it\u2014if it takes a week or two, that\u2019s okay. You could write a first version, even if it\u2019s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.\nRemember, it\u2019s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them\u2014this is very normal.\nTake it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve got this.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24542\nHi @queso, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it\u2019s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a tough time, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself during this period.\nFirstly, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It\u2019s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time\u2014editing your resume doesn\u2019t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.\nIt\u2019s also important not to compare your journey with others\u2019. Everyone\u2019s path is different, and where others are at doesn\u2019t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.\nYour mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You\u2019ve got this!\n\n",

It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today.

It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24071\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through\u2014navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you\u2019re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re on the right track.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that it\u2019s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It\u2019s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it\u2019s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn\u2019t to tear yourself down\u2014it\u2019s to learn and grow.\nIt\u2019s possible that some of what you\u2019re feeling\u2014like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism\u2014could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we\u2019re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It\u2019s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.\nIn relationships, communication is key, but it\u2019s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014it might just mean that you\u2019re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.\nOne step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that\u2019s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship to feel secure?\u201d or \u201cHow can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person\u2019s perspective?\u201d It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself\u2014like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism\u2014rather than trying to fix everything at once.\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.\nYou\u2019re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that\u2019s a powerful first step. It\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don\u2019t have to figure it all out at once.\nTake care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Scott97 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24606\nHi @FuYuan_Affections! Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don\u2019t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?\nThanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24687\nHi @Scott97,\nThank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It\u2019s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you\u2019re facing. It\u2019s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You\u2019re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.\nWhen you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.\nSince you\u2019re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it\u2019s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:\n- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you\u2019d like help with. You\u2019ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.\n- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It\u2019s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won\u2019t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.\n- The more honest and open you can be about how you\u2019re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It\u2019s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don\u2019t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.\n- Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see progress when we\u2019re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you\u2019ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you\u2019ve come.\n- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You\u2019ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.\n- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it\u2019s natural to want quick solutions, it\u2019s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.\nI\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You\u2019ve already shown that you\u2019re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don\u2019t be afraid to take things one session at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!\nIf you have any more questions as you prepare for therapy, feel free to reach out. We are here for you.\n\n",
