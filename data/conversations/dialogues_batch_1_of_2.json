I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice!

Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I used to have anxiety attacks but now Im numb to them. Is that the reason, or have I started behaving differently around them? I cant help but think that Im just an acquaintance to everyone I know. I can\u2019t confide in anyone because I dont trust them due to valid reasons. What exactly am I going through?\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 22918\nHi Sonja\nThank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.\nFirstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.\nIf you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.\nShe could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.\nPlease do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: Sonja (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24145\nThank you for the much appreciated advice! Sadly my school does not have a counselor:( but i\u2019ll keep your advice in mind\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: terravolt43 (User)\nPost ID: 24154\nHi Sonja,\nThanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you\u2019re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\nFrom what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you\u2019re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.\nIt is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!\nUnderstand that you feel like you can\u2019t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?\n\n",

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that.

It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

I\u2019m a healthcare worker. These mistakes made me feel very disappointed in myself and fear of work now. I\u2019ve been very careful in my work. But how can I improve myself more? I am afraid of the responsibility. Worrying whether will I be labeled as \u201cincompetent\u201d by my superiors and colleagues. I lost faith in myself and in my career\u2026\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 23646\nHi @user1306,\nThank you for sharing what you\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you\u2019re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human\u2014especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it\u2019s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.\nIt sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that\u2019s understandable. When we\u2019re afraid of being labeled as \u201cincompetent,\u201d it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You\u2019re already being very careful in your work, and that\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re committed to doing your best.\nImproving yourself doesn\u2019t mean being perfect\u2014it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you\u2019ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.\nIt\u2019s also important to address the fear and anxiety you\u2019re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don\u2019t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you\u2019re feeling, whether it\u2019s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn\u2019t expect.\nKeep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You\u2019ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don\u2019t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don\u2019t take away from all the good you\u2019ve done and will continue to do.\nTake it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control\u2014your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You\u2019re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.\nPlease take care of yourself, and know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: bubumi (User)\nPost ID: 24048\nhey! just a disclaimer that i\u2019m not a professional, but i do want to chime in as i am having similar concerns as you and i\u2019d like to share what helps me. i\u2019ve just started working recently and it\u2019s my first proper job, so there\u2019s sooo many things i\u2019m unfamiliar with, even the basic stuff. coupled with my perfectionist tendencies, it just makes for a lot of anxieties and fears with making mistakes. everyone around seems so competent too, and i\u2019m having a lot of impostor syndrome, wondering if i deserve to have a role in this field\u2026 so i hear you :\u2019)\ni see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i\u2019m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that\u2019s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in\u2026 but what i\u2019ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it\u2019s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what\u2019s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.\nbe kind to yourself, don\u2019t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don\u2019t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: Tommyhorse (User)\nPost ID: 24074\n<QUOTE from 23644>\nI \u2019 v e   b e e n   m a k i n g   f e w   m i s t a k e s   f o r   t h e   p a s t   2   m o n t h s   a t   m y   w o r k p l a c e .

I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone; I\u2019ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.\nIt\u2019s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that\u2019s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that\u2019s really important.\nWhile these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn\u2019t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done already. Keep it up!\nWhat helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I\u2019m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time.\nBest,\nTommy\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: eclipsemints (User)\nPost ID: 24129\nHello there!\nI feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.\nWhat I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!\nThank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: HanSolo2000 (User)\nPost ID: 24162\nHi @user1306 ,\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been struggling with making mistakes at work. It\u2019s completely normal to feel disappointed and fearful after experiencing setbacks, especially in a high-pressure field like healthcare. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re dedicated to your work and want to improve, which is commendable. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what\u2019s important is how we learn and grow from them. I am wondering if you are open to the idea of talking to a supervisor or mentor about your concerns? Sharing your feelings and seeking guidance could help alleviate some of your worries and provide you with a clearer path forward. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s okay to ask for support.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24213\nHello @user1306 ! Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. I see that you are disappointed with your performance at work due to the mistakes you\u2019ve made. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re disappointed. However, could those mistakes made on days when you\u2019re feeling slightly more tired or feeling a little off? I think it is great that you\u2019re spotting these mistakes and would like to improve yourself.\nPerhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes. However, remember that noting down these mistakes is not for you to dwell over them but to improve yourself. I think that it is perfectly normal to make mistakes. I believe there are so many things out there that you\u2019re doing really well at !\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let your failures define you. You have to let your failures teach you.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama\n\n",

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: user1138 (User)\nPost ID: 24067\nWhat i realised halfway was the more transparent i am, the easier the therapist can help me. Prepare a list u want to discuss w ur therapist or write down the qns n write down the answers in ur own time b4 the next session?\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24068\nHi @Anonymous394,\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you\u2019ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.\nFirst, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel the way you do. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly tough, and it\u2019s not something you should have to navigate alone. It\u2019s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you\u2019re in a place of pain.\nExpressing your feelings doesn\u2019t always come naturally\u2014especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can\u2019t be rushed.\nCounselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don\u2019t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn\u2019t the right fit, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn\u2019t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.\nReaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you\u2019ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are\u2014without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it\u2019s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.\nPlease know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. If you\u2019re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately\u2014whether it\u2019s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional\u2014can make a difference.\nYou\u2019ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now. I\u2019m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.\nPlease take care, and don\u2019t give up on finding the support you deserve.\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: anonymous394 (Help Seeker)\nPost ID: 24094\nhi @FuYuan_Affections, thanks for your comment. it does make me feel a little better. I\u2019ve gone to see my counsellor and psychiatrist in school. Both of them dropped me just like this i think because they do have alot of other cases to handle as well but it really hurts to think that maybe im not that important or im really the problem in this case that I should stop wasting people\u2019s time when there are others that are in more severe cases. I really hate myself and hate my life so much. im a joke.\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24110\nHi @Anonymous394,\nThank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.\nFirst, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone\u2019s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it\u2019s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It\u2019s not about you being \u201cless important\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right support that meets your needs.\nI know it\u2019s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you\u2019re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help\u2014like you did with your counselors, and even here\u2014takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it\u2019s hard to see that right now.\nIt might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.\nPlease remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don\u2019t define you. There is hope, even if it\u2019s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust\u2014they\u2019re there to help you in these moments.\nYou\u2019ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that\u2019s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again\u2026\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: hereforyou (User)\nPost ID: 24124\nHi @anonymous394, I just want to share that I was in a similar situation like you as well. Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.\nAs I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don\u2019t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I\u2019m here for you and many others are here for you as well.\nI am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I\u2019m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve. Hang in there and know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and cared for. I\u2019m here for you.\n\nPost Number: 7\nUsername: octopus (User)\nPost ID: 24125\nhey, im really sorry you had this experience with your counsellor even if you dont know how to express yourself yet, you still deserve to get the support you need\ni get how it feels like no one cares, it really hurts to be dropped by a counsellor. but that counsellor is just one person and this isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth.\nnavigating counsellors and the mental health system is really tough and a long process and its especially hard when you\u2019re in a bad place if you\u2019re open to it maybe you could look into other counsellors? you deserve to have a space where you feel safe!\nwe care about you and are here for you\n\n",

Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness.

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3.

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously.

Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

This can lead to simple things like just making sure i have everything before i go or making simple decisions. Recently a guy has been trying to talk to my girlfriend and even despite knowing that she is dating me he still tries to talk with her continuously. Although i know people often say that i should just let it be and not be worried because if my girlfriend truly loved me then nothing would happen but i cant help but have the fear that i would lose her. With my anxious attachment, although she reassures me, when i see their text messages i feel that she is too friendly and this often makes me feel overwhelmed and ultimately makes me anxious and fear losing her\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: avocadotoast (User)\nPost ID: 24115\nHi @user1322, just like you, I myself am the biggest over-thinker myself and I tend to think of the worst case scenario that can happen. Overthinking is something many people struggle with, especially when it comes to relationships and situations that feel uncertain or out of control, so you are not alone AT ALL!! It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling anxious about someone else trying to talk to your girlfriend, especially given your anxious attachment style. If I were you, I would also be concerned if an opposite gender was trying really hard to talk to my partner. Maybe you can try communicating to your partner that you feel uncomfortable with the way she texts other people and see if she is able to accommodate to your needs. Ultimately, 99% of the time, there will be no good that comes out of overthinking other than having increased stress and anxiety. I hope that moving forward, you will be able to let go of unnecessary worries and live in the moment.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: CaringBee (Professional)\nPost ID: 24117\nHi user1322\nThank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.\nMay I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.\nI encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:\n2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.\n3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.\n4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.\n5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.\n6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.\nRemember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.\n\n",

I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms.

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms.

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6. Sessions should feel natural and have a progression: start with rapport-building, move to deeper exploration, and conclude with goal-setting or reflection.\n",

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session.

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",

They also respect the client's boundaries and decision making at their own pace.\n- Goal Oriented: The therapist is goal oriented as they envision goals that the client can work towards to in their mental health journey.\n\nChain of thought:\n1. Establish rapport with his or her client at the start of each therapy session.\n2. Balances between responding empathetically and gathering information about the client, but he or she will always respect the boundaries established by the patient.\n3. The therapist along with the client will dive deeper into conversational subtopics, explore thoughts, emotions, behaviours and coping mechanisms. However, do be realistic and ensure that the conversation reflects the nature of a 30min to 1hr therapy session.\n4. The therapist would envision goals that the client can work towards to, provide advice such as guidance or coping techniques.\n5. Keep the dialogue realistic within the context of a therapy session. This means avoiding too many subtopics and maintaining focus on specific issues raised by Persona A. \n6.

No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn\u2019t connect with them I stop going.\nI feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it\u2019s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I\u2019m just exhausted from everything\n\nPost Number: 2\nUsername: FuYuan_Affections (Professional)\nPost ID: 24112\nHi @SLCBY,\nI want to thank you for sharing your experience here\u2014it takes courage to open up about what you\u2019re going through, especially when it feels like you\u2019ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you\u2019re feeling\u2014detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy\u2014are all common signs of burnout or depression. It\u2019s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you\u2019d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.\nOne of the hardest things about what you\u2019re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It\u2019s not surprising that this has been going on for years\u2014when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.\nIt sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that\u2019s keeping you grounded, and that\u2019s important to recognize. However, the strain it\u2019s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you\u2019re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body\u2019s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like the healthiest response.\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I\u2019m really sorry that it wasn\u2019t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it\u2019s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn\u2019t work out right away\u2014especially when it\u2019s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you\u2019re not beyond it. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cbeyond help,\u201d but rather that you haven\u2019t found the right kind of support yet.\nIf financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:\n2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019\n3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT\n4. SOS - 1767\n5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800\n6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]\nThese resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\nIt might also help to start with small, manageable steps\u2014things that don\u2019t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that\u2019s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you\u2019re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.\nI also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond repair\u2014it means you\u2019re carrying a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel worn down. It\u2019s okay to need help, and it\u2019s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you\u2019re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.\nIf it ever feels too overwhelming, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.\nYou\u2019ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that\u2019s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014you deserve support just as much as anyone else.\n\nPost Number: 3\nUsername: ukiyo (User)\nPost ID: 24171\nI can\u2019t say I know how you\u2019re feeling exactly but it sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a lot. It really means a lot that you have tried getting help and are still finding ways to seek help through this website. I\u2019m not too sure whether this advice will help and it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t but maybe you could try finding a hobby that is more indoors? Since you mentioned that you try to avoid going out, maybe a hobby at home would help. Sometimes life is about finding something we can enjoy, something that encourages and motivates to go on even when life gets tough. Finding that something may take time but it will be worth it\n\nPost Number: 4\nUsername: potatooo (User)\nPost ID: 24182\nHello @SLCBY! Thank you for sharing how you\u2019re feeling. I can relate to how you\u2019re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it\u2019s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don\u2019t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.\nIf you\u2019re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.\nI understand that therapy can be financially taxing but if you would like to talk to someone, we are always here for you to talk to\n\nPost Number: 5\nUsername: ZenCat (User)\nPost ID: 24538\nHey @SLCBY , thanks for opening up. It\u2019s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you\u2019re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.\nThe stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck\u2014wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.\nIt\u2019s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn\u2019t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.\nThere are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.\nYou\u2019re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don\u2019t need to fix everything at once. When you\u2019re ready, reaching out\u2014whether to a therapist, a friend, or a support group\u2014can be your next step. We are here for you, too.\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPost Number: 6\nUsername: RyanW (User)\nPost ID: 24688\nHey @SLCBY thanks for sharing about your thoughts and feelings. That you took the courage to put your story here is amazing already cause it\u2019s a tough one for many, many people.\nIt\u2019s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you\u2019re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you\u2019ve numbed yourself from so many things.\nBut if you don\u2019t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn\u2019t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.\nSometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it\u2019ll let you feel a lil\u2019 bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don\u2019t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.\nIf you ever worry you don\u2019t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.\nIf you ever need anything, I, we are here for you.\n\n",
