People told me to just go for counselling as they are trained professionals that helps you to navigate your feelings and help you to open up more in the process. As such, I decided to give counselling a try just for the counsellor to tell me that she doesn\u2019t know how to help me because I couldn\u2019t express myself better and sometimes she asks me questions as though im suppose to have an answer/ solution for the situation im facing and if i say idk, it will just be an awkward silent as if im not trying hard enough. But if i knew the answer, I would\u2019ve been able to save myself and not be at this counselling session would i? Eventually, she felt that there was no progress and just dropped me. Now I just feel stupid for reaching out for help and it feels as though im undeserving on any help as well. it feels like everyone is annoyed that im having a hard time and im annoyed at myself for feeling and being this way. They always say to reach out for help but how am i suppose to reach out when nobody cares? I have utilised my resources given to me as my last resort and at this point, im not even hoping for a recovery anymore, i just hope to have an outburst of bravery to really just end it all.\n\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "persona_response", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}, "age_range": {"type": "string"}, "gender": {"type": "string"}, "background": {"type": "string"}, "mental_health_symptoms": {"type": "string"}, "perspective": {"type": "string"}, "motivations": {"type": "string"}, "emotional_state": {"type": "string"}, "needs": {"type": "string"}, "conversational_stance": {"type": "string"}, "type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Identified", "Diversified"]}}, "required": ["name", "age_range", "gender", "background", "mental_health_symptoms", "perspective", "motivations", "emotional_state", "needs", "conversational_stance", "type"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

I feel down everyday. No mood in doing everything. When it\u2019s my off day I refuse to leave the house and prefer to stay in my room or stay in bed I will only go to the washroom or eat my meals if I really need to. My room is in a mess, I want to clean up but i can\u2019t bring myself to start. My sleep schedule is chaotic\nWhen I come back from work I don\u2019t want to do anything and I will either lay on the sofa or bed and use my phone normally I will only drag myself to deal with my personal hygiene after midnight.\nI have super low self esteem and 100% introvert. When I look at mirror I feel like I dunno who is that. I am afraid to look at people in their eyes when I go out I have to put headphone listen to music else i will easily loss temper I feel easily irritated easily angry.\nAt work I\u2019m scared of my superior opinion, they had certain expectstions from me but they said i have not met their expectations and what is wrong with me. I\u2019m afraid to voice out if possible i can go slient the whole day but I\u2019m working as customer service so it\u2019s impacting on my performance always got called by my superior asking why am I not proactive and i dunno how to respond. I thought of quiting my job but I feel my job is the only thing that ground me if i quit i will definitely go into a sprial.\nWhen my colleagues text me on work related I feel irritated but I will reply almost immediately but when my friends or family text me I will not reply at all or only reply few days later. When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.\nWhen people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I\u2019m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.\nWhen things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.\nThis has been going on for years on and off.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn\u2019t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.\nI think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can\u2019t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.\nMy therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don\u2019t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.\nCan someone take my pain and loneliness away and advice why do I always want to quit my job every time I feel uncomfortable. Should I quit my job? Why can\u2019t I be stable and how do I achieve this?\n\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "persona_response", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}, "age_range": {"type": "string"}, "gender": {"type": "string"}, "background": {"type": "string"}, "mental_health_symptoms": {"type": "string"}, "perspective": {"type": "string"}, "motivations": {"type": "string"}, "emotional_state": {"type": "string"}, "needs": {"type": "string"}, "conversational_stance": {"type": "string"}, "type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Identified", "Diversified"]}}, "required": ["name", "age_range", "gender", "background", "mental_health_symptoms", "perspective", "motivations", "emotional_state", "needs", "conversational_stance", "type"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.\nI never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.\nI have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i\u2019ve been through.\nI have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and \u201crun away\u201d from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.\nAt times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don\u2019t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to \u201cremove\u201d the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can\u2019t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.\nI wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression?

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what\u2019s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn\u2019t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don\u2019t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don\u2019t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it\u2019s a me issue or the relationship issue.\nThanks for reading if you managed to read finish haha\n\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "persona_response", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}, "age_range": {"type": "string"}, "gender": {"type": "string"}, "background": {"type": "string"}, "mental_health_symptoms": {"type": "string"}, "perspective": {"type": "string"}, "motivations": {"type": "string"}, "emotional_state": {"type": "string"}, "needs": {"type": "string"}, "conversational_stance": {"type": "string"}, "type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Identified", "Diversified"]}}, "required": ["name", "age_range", "gender", "background", "mental_health_symptoms", "perspective", "motivations", "emotional_state", "needs", "conversational_stance", "type"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn\u2019t end well and it\u2019s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)\nThe longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).\nAnother thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.\nI have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.\nAs I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.\nBut all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.\n\n"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "persona_response", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}, "age_range": {"type": "string"}, "gender": {"type": "string"}, "background": {"type": "string"}, "mental_health_symptoms": {"type": "string"}, "perspective": {"type": "string"}, "motivations": {"type": "string"}, "emotional_state": {"type": "string"}, "needs": {"type": "string"}, "conversational_stance": {"type": "string"}, "type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Identified", "Diversified"]}}, "required": ["name", "age_range", "gender", "background", "mental_health_symptoms", "perspective", "motivations", "emotional_state", "needs", "conversational_stance", "type"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}
