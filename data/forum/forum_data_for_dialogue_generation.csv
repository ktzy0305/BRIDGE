Thank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.
Firstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.
If you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.
She could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.
Please do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.",,0,,,,,

Thanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you’re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.
From what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you’re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.
It is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!
Understand that you feel like you can’t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’ve been going through. It’s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that’s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you’re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.
First, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human—especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It’s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it’s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.
It sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that’s understandable. When we’re afraid of being labeled as “incompetent,” it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You’re already being very careful in your work, and that’s a good sign that you’re committed to doing your best.
Improving yourself doesn’t mean being perfect—it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you’ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.
It’s also important to address the fear and anxiety you’re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don’t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you’re feeling, whether it’s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn’t expect.
Keep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You’ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don’t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don’t take away from all the good you’ve done and will continue to do.
Take it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control—your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You’re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.
Please take care of yourself, and know that it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don’t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.",,1,,,,,

i see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i’m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that’s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in… but what i’ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it’s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what’s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.
be kind to yourself, don’t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don’t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!",,1,,,,,

Hi there,
Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—your struggles are completely valid. I want you to know that you’re not alone; I’ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.
It’s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that’s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that’s really important.
While these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn’t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I’m sure you’ve done already. Keep it up!
What helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I’m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.
You’ve got this, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time.
Best,

I feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.
What I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!
Thank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!",,1,,,,,

Perhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes.

I’m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you’ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.
First, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel the way you do. What you’re going through is incredibly tough, and it’s not something you should have to navigate alone. It’s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you’re in a place of pain.
Expressing your feelings doesn’t always come naturally—especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can’t be rushed.
Counselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don’t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn’t the right fit, but that doesn’t mean that you’re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn’t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn’t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.
Reaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you’ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are—without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it’s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.
Please know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now. If you’re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It’s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately—whether it’s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional—can make a difference.
You’ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that’s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. I’m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.
Please take care, and don’t give up on finding the support you deserve.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you’re going through. I’m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.
First, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone’s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it’s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn’t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It’s not about you being “less important”—it’s about finding the right support that meets your needs.
I know it’s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you’re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help—like you did with your counselors, and even here—takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it’s hard to see that right now.
It might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that’s okay. You’re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.
Please remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don’t define you. There is hope, even if it’s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust—they’re there to help you in these moments.
You’ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that’s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again…",,0,,,,,

Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.
As I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don’t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I’m here for you and many others are here for you as well.
I am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I’m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve.

Thank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.
May I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.
I encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:
2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.
3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.
4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.
5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.
6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.
Remember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.",,0,,,,,

When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.
When people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I’m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.
When things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.
This has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn’t connect with them I stop going.
I feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it’s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I’m just exhausted from everything",,0,,,,,

I want to thank you for sharing your experience here—it takes courage to open up about what you’re going through, especially when it feels like you’ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.
From what you’ve described, it sounds like you’re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you’re feeling—detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy—are all common signs of burnout or depression. It’s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you’d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.
One of the hardest things about what you’re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It’s not surprising that this has been going on for years—when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.
It sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that’s keeping you grounded, and that’s important to recognize. However, the strain it’s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you’re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body’s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn’t always feel like the healthiest response.
You mentioned that you’ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I’m really sorry that it wasn’t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it’s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn’t work out right away—especially when it’s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you’re not beyond it. It’s not that you’re “beyond help,” but rather that you haven’t found the right kind of support yet.
If financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:
2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019
3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT
4. SOS - 1767
5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800
6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]
These resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you’re feeling overwhelmed.
It might also help to start with small, manageable steps—things that don’t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that’s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you’re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.
I also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn’t mean you’re beyond repair—it means you’re carrying a lot, and it’s understandable that you’d feel worn down. It’s okay to need help, and it’s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you’re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.
If it ever feels too overwhelming, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.
You’ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that’s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it’s okay to ask for help—you deserve support just as much as anyone else.",SAMH https://www.samhealth.org.sg/our-services/outreach/samh-insight-centre/#1545895446184-0c71e7f9-ecc9; webCHAT 1 https://www.imh.com.sg/CHAT/GetHelp/webCHAT/Pages/default.aspx; Care Corner https://www.carecorner.org.sg/services/insight,0,,,,,

I can relate to how you’re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it’s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don’t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.
If you’re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.

It’s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you’re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.
It sounds like you’ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it’s totally understandable that you’re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.
The stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck—wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.
It’s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn’t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.
There are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.
You’re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don’t need to fix everything at once.

It’s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you’re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you’ve numbed yourself from so many things.
But if you don’t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn’t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.
Sometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it’ll let you feel a lil’ bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don’t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.
If you ever worry you don’t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn’t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.
I think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can’t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.
My therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don’t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.

Thank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.
May I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.
(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:
Job Insecurity and Mental Health
I have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.
Impact of Childhood Trauma
Childhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being “good enough” and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.
Support Systems
I am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It’s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.
(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:
Therapy
Continue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.
Finding Meaning in Work
Since you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.
Setting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn’t ignite your passion.
Work-Life Balance
Seek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.
Engaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.
Consider Job Flexibility
If possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.
Evaluate Job Fit
If feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.
Making the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.
However, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that’s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.
Your feelings are valid, and it’s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.
Remember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.",,2,,,,,

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.
I never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.
I have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i’ve been through.
I have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and “run away” from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.
At times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don’t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to “remove” the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can’t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.
I wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to “control” my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?",,1,,,,,

Thank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .
While I can’t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.
Understanding your feelings
From what you’ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:
Persistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.
Physical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.
Difficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.
Emotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.
Suicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.
Impact of Past Trauma
Your childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It’s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.
Steps to Consider
2. Seek Professional Help
A mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.
3. Communicate with Your Partner
Communicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use “I” statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., “I feel overwhelmed when…”).
If your partner’s behavior is affecting your mental health, it’s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.
4. Practice Self-Care
Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.
Regular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn’t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.
Journaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.
5. Connect with Supportive People
Talk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.
If certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.
6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis
If you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.
7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help
If you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.
Your feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It’s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.",,0,,,,,

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what’s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn’t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don’t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn’t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don’t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it’s a me issue or the relationship issue.

Thank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.
Some key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:
2. Friends’ opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it’s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.
3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.
4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you’re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.
5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.
6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.
7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.
Remember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—it’s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you’re experiencing is very normal, and I’ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it’s okay to feel both.
It’s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it’s great that you’re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It’s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.
It’s also okay to feel unsure—relationships are complex, and it’s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don’t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.
Be gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You’re doing your best, and that’s something to be proud of. Trust yourself—you know what’s best for you.
Take care,
Tommy",,0,,,,,

Hi there,
Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—what you’re feeling is super valid. Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it’s completely okay to feel the way you do.
I’m also in the process of job searching, and I’ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.
One thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I’ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it—if it takes a week or two, that’s okay. You could write a first version, even if it’s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.
Remember, it’s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them—this is very normal.
Take it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You’ve got this.
Best,
Tommy", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/job-hunt-woes-not-my-first-time/15408/1,1,,24063,,,24063

Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it’s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you’re going through a tough time, and it’s important to be kind to yourself during this period.
Firstly, it’s great that you’re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It’s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time—editing your resume doesn’t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.
It’s also important not to compare your journey with others’. Everyone’s path is different, and where others are at doesn’t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.
Your mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.
You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You’ve got this!",,1,,,,,
15410,I think I am the problem in whichever relationship I get into,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-think-i-am-the-problem-in-whichever-relationship-i-get-into/15410,Seeking Help,needadvice,12553,Scott97,User,,24065,1,"As stated in the title. I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn’t end well and it’s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don’t even know what’s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)
The longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it’s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).
Another thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.
I have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.
As I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.
But all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’ve been going through—navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you’re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It’s clear that you’ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you’re not sure if you’re on the right track.
First, I want to acknowledge that it’s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It’s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it’s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It’s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn’t to tear yourself down—it’s to learn and grow.
It’s possible that some of what you’re feeling—like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism—could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we’re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It’s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.
In relationships, communication is key, but it’s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong—it might just mean that you’re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It’s okay to be a work in progress.
One step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that’s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, “What do I need in a relationship to feel secure?” or “How can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person’s perspective?” It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself—like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism—rather than trying to fix everything at once.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.
You’re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that’s a powerful first step. It’s okay to take things one step at a time, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don’t have to figure it all out at once.
Take care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don’t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?
Thanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It’s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you’re facing. It’s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You’re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.
When you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.
Since you’re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it’s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:
- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you’d like help with. You’ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.
- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It’s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won’t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.
- The more honest and open you can be about how you’re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It’s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don’t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.
- Sometimes it’s hard to see progress when we’re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you’ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you’ve come.
- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You’ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.
- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it’s natural to want quick solutions, it’s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that’s okay—sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.
I’m really glad that you’re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You’ve already shown that you’re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don’t be afraid to take things one session at a time—you’ve got this!

The school I’m in is a good school. For sure. However, I was never given the chance or opportunity to contribute and help out. I was at one time rejected from a leader role while my friends got in. This made me harbour a high level of envy and I began to feel that I am never going to be good enough even if I try.
In life, I am always slower than the others because I need time to process things. But it seems like everyone in my life like my family and authorised people wanted me to do things fast and I have tried going faster before but in the end, things don’t turn out as well as when I’m slower in terms of quality.
My maturity is also slowed down because I was born with Autism and it affected the way I behaved back then because I wasn’t able to mature normally in time. Time is basically my mortal enemy and there’s no way anyone can control it.
I feel that there isn’t hope trying to be perfect. I want to be normal just like everyone. Everyone to me have a lot of achievements and get better benefits while for me, I feel useless to them. Why am I so different, why can’t I be like everyone else, why am I not accepted for being different among everyone?",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of heavy feelings, especially around comparing yourself to others and feeling different because of your autism. It’s completely understandable to feel frustrated when it seems like others are achieving things more easily than you.
Autism can make it feel like the world is moving at a pace that’s hard to keep up with, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t capable or valuable. Everyone’s journey is different, and it’s okay to take the time you need to process things at your own pace. It’s not about being perfect or being like everyone else—it’s about finding your own rhythm and recognizing your unique strengths.
It’s really tough to feel left out or overlooked, especially when you’re trying your best. But please know that being different doesn’t make you less than anyone else. It just means you have your own path to walk, and that path is important.
I’d encourage you to reflect on the things you do well, the qualities that make you special, and how far you’ve come. It might also help to talk to someone you trust about these feelings, whether it’s a teacher, family member, or counselor. Sometimes just having someone listen can make a big difference.
You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s okay to ask for support when you need it. Continue moving forward at your own pace and keep in mind that how quickly you move or how much you accomplish in comparison to others does not determine your value. It’s about being true to yourself and recognizing your worth just as you are.

Thank you for reaching out for support. By facing the circumstances surrounding the challenging situation you are experiencing, please know that you are displaying much courage . I also want to assure you that the overwhelm, anger, hurt and resentment you are facing is understandable and fully valid. You are not alone as many long-distance relationships (LDRs) do face challenges of connection, communication and felt presence in each other’s lives.
My heart goes out to you when you shared that you endured childhood trauma. You shared that the impact of the past trauma is still showing up currently and may be disrupting your normal functioning. May I encourage you to speak to a therapist about this. He/she can gently help you process the trauma in a safe environment such that eventually there is reduced impact in the present day. The therapist can also equip you with skills to cope more effectively when challenges arise in the future. One of the other therapy goals you may want to consider is to address self-esteem challenges.
You are precious anonymous374, please do not forget that. Write down your strengths and achievements and reflect on what those around you have to say about how you have enriched their lives. Keep this list handy and refer to it often to remind yourself how precious and worthy you are.
I encourage you to have an honest conversation with your long-distance partner. Use ‘I’ statements to share how you are feeling, communicate your experiences and jointly agree on some boundaries, expectations, and rituals both parties need to observe for a healthier fulfilling relationship.
You fully deserve and are worthy of a reciprocal respectful and fulfilling relationship. By communicating your needs and with a honest open discussion, both of you can strive to reach a mutually loving and understanding relationship.",,0,,,,,

I also forget lots of things like my past promises and mistakes I’ve made to my friend and I still made the same mistakes by not thinking before answering, not being attentive in terms of listening and dragging out the conversation which I could have just said that I do not know (it was the one time, when my friend asked me a question about what ‘class’ is in programming, I do not know and chatgptted and still do not know but instead of saying ‘i don’t know’, I tried to answer and going back and forth, my friend called me out that I should have just said that I do not know and honestly, I should have said that but it didn’t come into my mind). I couldn’t even talk properly and even stutter which my friend is pissed about because there’s nothing to be scared of if I just said it out loud which I tried to but forget. I tried to keep a look out on those mistakes that might appear in situation but the more I look out/scared, the more it happens and at the same time, I could not tell myself not to think too much about the mistakes because if I don’t think about it, it will repeat again too. I graduated from poly but I forgotten all the things I learn from there too and entering university with an exemption to year 2. I want to work hard but as much as I study and understand, I forget easily and I’m afraid it would strain with my relationship with my friend, future friends and my future career. According to Google, I might have a brain fog which I find it true, I couldn’t focus nor think properly, forget easily and couldn’t speak properly and very slow in terms of processing each sentence people have to say. I’m unconfident, indecisive and quite oblivious. I’m easily scared and panicked whenever I get questioned because the first instinct I thought of is that ‘did I make a mistake again?’ and overthinking too much including simple questions. What can I do? I do not know because I’m scared it is wrong and I’m slowly starting to exercise bit by bit and trying my best to get enough sleep. But I’m anxious and scared what if I make the same mistake and feel like I went back to square one again and I also don’t want to tire my friend by upsetting him and giving him false hope whenever I said I will do better and then repeat the same thing again. As much as I want to say it out on what I think but at the same time, I do not know if its correct or right to say in a very tense situation and overthink everything. (How I get scared easily is because in the past, I get scolded and shouted a lot by my parents although I do not remember but I believe I did do stupid things many times.)",,0,,,,,

Thank you for being upfront and brave in sharing what you are experiencing. Your feelings of anxiety, self-doubt and low confidence are fully understandable and valid given how challenging your childhood was. Please do take heart and know that you are not alone. With self-awareness and the determined disposition that you possess, I believe you will be able to successfully overcome the setbacks of the past and the challenges faced ahead. There are strategies and steps to unlearn some of the beliefs that were formed since young which I hope you consider .
a) Speak to your school counsellor who can provide a safe space for you to process some of the unhelpful thinking patterns (such as overthinking) and core beliefs and reframe them to more useful thoughts and beliefs. Additionally, it will be an opportunity to articulate your values and identify what you want.
By self-evaluating current actions and their effectiveness, and choosing changes to be made, you could chart ways to move closer towards what you want.
b) Improve communication skills. Work on active listening, clarifying questions and expressing yourself clearly. Instead of rushing to answer with a ""Yes’, actively choose to slow down, reflect and think before responding. Practise saying ‘No’, or say ‘let me think about it and get back to you’. Slowly you will gain more confidence in your decision making and articulating your thoughts and views. It will be uncomfortable at first when you say ‘No’; go through with it nevertheless and you can get more confident over time.
c) Build confidence. Write down your achievements, celebrate even small ones, focus on strengths and choose to hold negative thoughts loosely instead of fusing with them. It is only human to make mistakes, and everyone makes them. Forgive yourself, learn from them and choose to focus on looking forward.
d) Address the brain fog. Keep up the good work of exercising, healthy meals and sleeping adequately. If brain fog continues, consider seeking medical help/opinion.
Seek to improve daily, even if it is a small change. Target to be a better version of yourself today than you were the day before. Gradual improvement and adopting a growth mindset are sustainable ways to enhance yourself. Always remember to be kind to yourself for past mistakes or missteps and acknowledge changes will take time. You can do this!",,0,,,,,

I can sense that you are quite anxious about how you should respond to other people. Additionally, I am also very sorry to hear about being exposed to verbal criticisms from your parents growing up. I understand that you are struggling with processing sentences and focusing on conversations. As someone who had also struggled with a brain fog 2 years ago, it can be very frustrating not being able to have simple conversations with friends as it can be hard to concentrate.
If I may offer some words to you, I would like to say that you seem like a very caring individual who wants to help others to the best of your abilities. Although you were unsure of how to answer the question on programming, you still tried to help them out!
Alot of the anxiety I am sensing through this post could have originated with constantly being scolded by your parent as mentioned towards the end of your post. Would you want to try counselling? If you are worried about costs, there are many free resources out there like TOUCH community services and Feiyue community services. Both organisations provide counselling
Another thing that helped me with overthinking was reminding myself that if no one said to me directly that I am a terrible and useless person, there is no reason why I should see myself as terrible and useless.
Lastly, another thing that helped me was journaling. When expressing myself verbally was quite difficult, I sought to write in a journal instead as an anxiety outlet. Do not worry, there are no strict formats on how to journal. It can be one word, one sentence, one paragraph and even a few pages. I find that rereading what I wrote gives me a clearer picture of what I am going through and may even help me find a solution.
Overall, you seem like an empathetic and sweet person
I hope that you can seek the help you need! Do understand that the healing journey may not always be linear but by taking care of yourself more and finding some confidence back, getting out of this mind fog is not entirely impossible

to start with, i’m autistic. i’ve come to realise that this has had a huge impact on all my relationships: i don’t make friends easily, and the ones i have i cling to hard. i tend to get to know people, including dates, without a clear end goal in mind (like a romantic relationship/ marriage/ friendship/ friend with benefits) so it can “develop naturally”. i have no qualms at all about sex on a first date, because sexual compatibility is basically a deciding factor in a relationship to me.
as always, i’ve caught a lot of flack for this. i’ve heard a lot about being considered “not girlfriend material”, “not worth it”, and other things that imply i’m only good for being used and discarded. a now ex-friend of mine would compare herself to me: she was such a good girlfriend, i was nothing more than a wh-re. thanks to the abovementioned autism i already have some issues with feeling unfeminine and monstrous: this just feeds into my insecurities.
now for the problem: i met a man about a month ago, and we’ve been getting along pretty well. i find i can talk to him about so many things and i don’t need to mask around him. i’d say we’re friends with benefits for now, but actual friends. we agree on not forming relationships with end goals. but lately he’s told me that he’s decided he wants kids, and wants to find, quote, “the mother of his children”, and that’s why he’s going to limit contact with me.
i do not want to lose what has been a good friendship: those are hard to come by. the sex has been great, too, and honestly that’s what usually wins me over. but clearly i am being used as a placeholder for a good wife and mother, and that has triggered my issues around feeling unvalued.
i would like some advice on how to cope with this, how to limit negative self-thought, and how to navigate relationships without having to mask/change who i am.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing so openly about your experiences. It’s clear that you have a deep understanding of yourself, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to explore these complex emotions and situations.
Being autistic, as you mentioned, has undoubtedly shaped how you navigate relationships and your sense of self, how you communicate, interact, and perceive the world around you, so the challenges and strengths can vary widely. Did you have the chance to discuss in depth about your autism with a professional and attend counselling to help you in relationships?
You’ve mentioned that sex is a significant factor in your relationships, and it seems like it serves as a way to connect with others and perhaps even as a coping mechanism. It’s not uncommon for people to use physical intimacy to manage or express emotions, especially when dealing with insecurities or feelings of being unfeminine or monstrous, as you’ve described. However, in many cultural contexts, including in parts of Asia, sex is often seen as more than just a physical act; it’s tied to deeper meanings of intimacy and commitment. This might be contributing to the conflicts you’re feeling, especially if there’s a misalignment in how you and your friend view the role of sex in your relationship.
The situation with the man you’ve been seeing highlights a significant challenge—he’s expressed a desire for something that goes beyond your current agreement, which has triggered feelings of being unvalued. This is understandable, especially when it feels like you’re being seen as a placeholder rather than a true partner.
It’s crucial to acknowledge these feelings but also to consider how you can stay true to yourself in navigating this situation. Authenticity is key here. Accepting your identity, including your autism, means embracing who you are without feeling the need to mask or change for others. This can lead to a sense of psychological freedom, where you feel you belong, even if the world around you doesn’t always understand or see your full beauty.
It’s also important to remember that just because this relationship may not fulfill all your needs doesn’t mean that there isn’t someone out there who will appreciate and value you for who you are. You may not find that person today, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the future. The key is your self-belief—how you view yourself and what you believe you deserve in a relationship.
As you continue to navigate these feelings, I encourage you to focus on your self-worth and authenticity. It might be helpful to explore these emotions further, possibly with a therapist who understands autism, to gain more clarity and to build coping mechanisms that support your mental and emotional well-being.
You’re on a journey of self-discovery and growth, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Trust that by staying true to yourself, you will find the connection and belonging that you deserve. Take care, and remember that your journey is valid and valuable. Let us know how you feel?",,0,,,,,

Context:
When we got together (May 22) the only misalignment was the topic on kids. We spoke about it here and there but only got serious in Dec 23 and during this time (Aug 23), she also went back to school.
She then wanted to take a break in Jan 24 and broke up with me in Mar 24. I feel like I wasn’t given a fair chance to rectify our issues and we didn’t do our best to take the relationship where it could go. I was ready to settle down and have kids with her (aligned on this now), but that didn’t change her mind about us.
We didn’t fight in our time together so I was surprised when she wanted to end the relationship. Turns out, there were stuff bothering her and she didn’t bring them up until the break up. I don’t know if this is just her defense mechanism to push through the break up by giving me as many reasons as possible, but I felt like these issues were solvable and I wasn’t given a chance to try. I also wrote a long letter to her detailing the steps I am willing to take to rectify these problems.
Reasons for breakup:
2. She didn’t want to “drag” me through her student life
3. Not showing enough care and concern
4. Felt like I changed my mind to want kids only because of the breakup
5. Issue of going 50/50 on money
6. Not being empathetic or a good listener
And others
Now I feel empty and hopeless. I’ve been careful to learn from my divorce, yet I didn’t even get a chance to rectify the issues she brought up. I don’t blame her at all and I wish we had the chance to grow together. I want a future with her again if it’s possible, but she’s no longer replying to my messages. I have been thinking:
2. Why and how do you put in effort when the outcome may be random and not something you can control?
3. How can I be happy when the outcome I want in the future seems impossible to obtain?
4. How or if I should date again, and still have the the possibility of getting back together with her?
5. Should I even hold on to the hope of getting back together?

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—breakups can be incredibly painful and confusing, especially when you feel like you weren’t given the chance to work through the issues together. It’s clear that you deeply care about your ex and the relationship you had, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling empty and hopeless right now.
It sounds like you’re struggling with a lot of “what-ifs” and “whys,” which is completely natural. When something ends unexpectedly, especially something as significant as a relationship, our minds can get stuck in a loop of trying to figure out what went wrong and how it could have been different. You mentioned that you’ve been careful to learn from your divorce, and it’s clear that you’ve been putting in a lot of effort to grow and avoid past mistakes. That kind of self-awareness and willingness to improve is really admirable.
But I also want to acknowledge the pain of not being able to apply those lessons in this relationship, especially when you feel like the issues were solvable. It’s hard when you want to make things right, but the other person isn’t in the same place or isn’t open to trying again. It can leave you feeling powerless, and that’s a tough place to be.
You asked about why and how to put in effort when the outcome might be random and beyond your control. This is one of the hardest parts of relationships—there are no guarantees, and sometimes, despite our best efforts, things don’t work out the way we hope. It’s a difficult truth, but it doesn’t mean that your efforts were meaningless or that they won’t be valuable in the future, whether in this relationship or another.
As for holding onto hope of getting back together, it’s natural to want that, especially when the breakup feels unresolved. However, it’s important to take care of yourself in the process. Holding onto hope can keep you stuck in a place of pain, especially if your ex isn’t responding to your messages. It might be helpful to give yourself some space to heal and to focus on what you need right now, rather than on what might happen in the future. If she’s meant to come back into your life, it will happen in its own time—but for now, taking care of your well-being is crucial.
When it comes to dating again, it’s important to do so when you feel ready, not as a way to distract yourself or fill the void left by the breakup. Give yourself the time and space you need to heal, and when you’re ready, approach dating with an open heart and mind. Remember, every relationship is a new opportunity to learn and grow, and you deserve to be with someone who values and respects you just as much as you do them.
It’s okay to feel the way you’re feeling right now, and it’s okay to take things one day at a time. Healing isn’t linear, and it’s perfectly normal to have good days and bad days. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself the time to grieve the relationship. Over time, things will start to make more sense, and you’ll find clarity about what’s next for you.

Thank you for the kind words and advice.
I’ve been feeling hopeless in general life as well, it feels like there’s no point in putting in effort for anything since the outcome is highly left to chance. For example, I can put in my best at work and be killed in an accident on the way home. I had someone to share my life/day with in the past, but I have no one now. At the end of the day, what’s the point of anything if I’m alone? Would you have any exercises or advice to help me move away from this mindset?
I’m aware that I can’t force / control her and I just got wait till she’s ready to talk to me again. My biggest fear is she won’t ever again. I think of her everyday and when my mood gets better after some time, I’m reminded of a past memory or place and my heart plummets again. Hope is painful, like you said. I’m in a dilemma where I want to stop feeling pain, but I don’t want to lose the happy memories. And when I think of these happy memories, I get back into the cycle of sadness/depression. I’ve “suppressed/buried” the thoughts/feelings from my divorce and my mom’s passing (10 years ago) that I no longer think/feel any of these anymore, but I don’t want the same for this relationship.

Thank you for sharing more about what you’re going through. I can sense the depth of your despair, and I want to acknowledge how incredibly difficult it must be to feel like life’s efforts are futile, especially when the outcomes seem so beyond our control.
It seems like the meaning in relationships has been deeply affected by the loss of two of the most important people in your life—your mother and your spouse. These relationships likely provided you with a sense of identity and purpose, and their absence has left a void that’s hard to fill.
One thing that stands out to me is how much you’ve invested in relationships with others, but I wonder if you’ve had the chance to focus on your relationship with yourself. It’s not uncommon for people to find their sense of self closely tied to their relationships, and when those relationships end, it can feel like a part of you is missing too. But this might be an opportunity to rediscover what you love about yourself and what gives you joy independently of others.
Loneliness, as difficult as it is, can also be a time for reflection and growth. It might give you the space to think about how much you know about yourself—your values, your passions, and what makes you feel alive. I believe that understanding and nurturing your relationship with yourself could be key to finding new meaning in life.
The grief and sadness you’re experiencing, especially after 10 years since your mother’s passing, might have created a sense of fear and frustration that’s been difficult to process. It’s understandable that these feelings would resurface, especially after another significant loss. This is where working with a counselor could be really helpful—someone who can help you process these emotions and develop healthier ways to cope.

I’ve been thinking about my values, passions etc. for a while now. I feel fine or happy while doing things I like etc., but get depressed again soon after, especially when I’m triggered by memories or a sad song. Or when I come home after a social engagement and find myself sitting alone in the darkness. It feels like I can only achieve 80% happiness alone and I can only reach 100% with a partner, because there’s stuff like sharing your life experiences, sex, building a family etc. – stuff that you can’t achieve alone. I feel like I can’t be truly “happy” alone
How do I hold on to these happy memories and not feel sad? I’ve not thought about my ex-wife or my mom for a while now and they seem “erased”, replaced by new memories that made the old ones seem like they never existed in the first place. That’s what I’m afraid of, losing these memories of my ex, and I don’t want to repeat the mistake of “erasing” memories again.

Thanks for sharing and am glad to hear that you are considering about how you can unpack more.

Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you’re going through. It’s not easy to open up about these kinds of struggles, and I really appreciate your honesty.
What you’re describing sounds like a common response to restrictive dieting. When we limit our food intake too much, our body can react by pushing us to eat more, sometimes leading to binge eating episodes. It’s like your body is trying to find balance and make sure it’s getting the energy it needs. So, what you’re experiencing is not unusual, and you’re not alone in this.
One thing that might help is to focus on a more balanced approach to eating. Instead of cutting out certain foods or eating too restrictively, try to include a variety of foods in your diet. Listening to your body’s hunger and fullness signals can also make a big difference—eating enough to feel satisfied can help reduce the urge to binge later on.
Another thing to think about is whether there’s anything else going on that might be affecting your eating habits. Stress, anxiety, or other emotions can sometimes lead to changes in how we eat, even if we don’t realize it.
If you’re open to it, talking to a nutritionist or a therapist who understands these issues could be really helpful. They can give you personalized advice and support to get back on track in a healthy way.
You’ve already taken a big step by recognizing what’s happening and reaching out for help, and that shows a lot of strength. You deserve to feel good about your journey, and it’s totally okay to ask for support along the way.

Looks like you had a good head start with delaying the need for chocolates past 10pm.
Thank you for being so open about what you’re going through. It also sounds like you’ve been really mindful of your eating habits and exercise, but it’s also understandable that these things can become overwhelming at times.
It’s great that you’re recognizing the pattern—that pre-planning your calories might be leading to feelings of restriction, which then sparks the urge to binge. This is a common cycle in experiencing it.
One thing to consider is finding a balance that feels less restrictive and more sustainable for you. Sometimes, being too rigid with calorie counting can create pressure that leads to those “why not just eat whatever?” thoughts. Instead of strict rules, try allowing yourself some flexibility with your eating. Perhaps consider healthier alternatives like nuts or fresh fruits? It might help to focus on nourishing your body rather than restricting it.
As for the exercise, if you’re finding that your current routine feels more like a chore than something you enjoy, it might be worth exploring different forms of movement that are fun and less stressful. Exercise should feel good, not like an obligation. Have you tried working out with a buddy?
If you ever feel like you’re struggling to manage this on your own, talking to a professional or nutritionist, could be really helpful. They can work with you to create a plan that’s healthier and more sustainable for your mind and body.
You’re doing the right thing by seeking advice and being honest about what’s going on. Keep being kind to yourself as you navigate this—finding a balance is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Let us know how you feel?",,0,,,,,

Since then feel i am a bad friend and i find my actions unforgiving. And our friendship and the situation didnt had a good closure as well… And at this juncture, while i have apologised, our friendship has ended and tbh i have not face to see them. I often think about this situation as well which i felt guilty and all. At this point, reconciling or talking to them is impossible as i am not brave enuf to. Yes i escaped, i am weak,i should have been brave but I am not that strong either. I cant forgive myself as i feel so ashamed…
(The most important point) And now to my present self, I am a job-seeker looking for a job… This situation had kinda impacted my life from moving on and additionally, I am also afraid to see them in the workforce as we are in the same field which makes me worry about being in the same company as them. How should I deal with such situation?",,0,,,,,
14141,Friendship betrayal,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/friendship-betrayal/14141,Coping,---,11048,FuYuan_Affections,Professional,The Wise,21826,2,"Hi @anxietytourist,
Thank you for sharing your story. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot with your friends, and it’s completely understandable to feel the way you do. Let’s break down what you’ve shared to address everything properly.
You’ve mentioned making a group of friends who felt like family but often feeling less confident and undeserving. Despite this, they always included you, which shows they valued your presence. It’s great to hear that they saw you as part of the group, even if you sometimes felt insecure.
Then, a thoughtless action on your part led to betraying these friends and losing them. You feel like a bad friend and find your actions unforgivable. Even though you apologized, the friendship ended without good closure, leaving you feeling guilty and ashamed. It’s important to recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and it’s clear that you genuinely regret what happened. Taking responsibility is a significant first step.
You mentioned that you often think about the situation and feel unable to face your friends due to guilt and shame. You see yourself as weak for not being brave enough to confront or reconcile with them. It’s essential to be kind to yourself and understand that forgiveness, especially self-forgiveness, takes time. You’re not weak for feeling this way; you’re human.
Now, you’re a job-seeker, and this situation has impacted your ability to move on. Additionally, you’re worried about encountering these friends in the workforce since you’re in the same field. It’s natural to feel anxious about this, but there are ways to manage these concerns.
Recognizing and Managing Anxiety: It’s completely natural to feel anxious about encountering your former friends in a professional setting. This anxiety is a normal reaction to the fear of the unknown and potential uncomfortable situations. Allow yourself to feel this anxiety without judgment. It’s a sign that you care about your interactions and relationships.
Self-Forgiveness and Empathy: We all make mistakes, especially in situations we’ve never encountered before. Your feelings of guilt and shame are reactions to what happened, not reflections of your character. Shame and guilt are emotions that follow actions we regret and are part of being human. It’s okay to feel these emotions, but it’s also important to recognize that they don’t define who you are.
Understanding Mistakes: It’s important to understand that mistakes happen, particularly when we’re faced with new and challenging situations. Reacting to these situations can sometimes lead to actions we regret later. This doesn’t mean you’re a bad person; it means you’re learning and growing. Every mistake is an opportunity to learn more about ourselves and how we handle difficult situations.
Building Confidence and Moving Forward: Start by being kind to yourself. Self-empathy is about treating yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend. Reflect on the positive aspects of your friendships and the growth you’ve experienced since then. Remember, it takes time to rebuild confidence. Take small steps to gradually build it up again.
When it comes to your job search, focus on your skills and strengths. You have a lot to offer, and your past doesn’t define your professional capabilities. If you do encounter your former friends at work, try to stay professional. You might prepare a simple, neutral statement in case the situation arises, such as, “I know we had some difficult times, but I hope we can work together professionally.”
Seeking Closure: If you feel it might help, consider writing a letter to your friends, even if you don’t send it. Sometimes, expressing your thoughts and feelings on paper can provide a sense of closure. If you ever feel ready, you might consider reaching out for a conversation. However, do this only if you feel comfortable and safe.
Professional Support: If you’re struggling with these feelings, it might be helpful to speak with a counselor or therapist. They can provide you with tools to manage anxiety and guilt, and help you navigate your current challenges. Remember, seeking professional help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
You’ve shown incredible resilience by seeking a new job and trying to move forward despite these challenges. Keep focusing on your strengths and the positive steps you’re taking. Please continue to share your thoughts and feelings as much as you feel comfortable. We’re here to listen and support you through this journey.
Take care, and best of luck with your job search.", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/friendship-betrayal/14141#strategies-for-moving-forward-1,1,,,,,

You should probably explain the situation to them. If they don’t want to get back with you, don’t let that affect you too much, as you tried your best anyway and you cannot control how other people act. You only have agency over what you do and say. Anyway, some friendships are not meant to be. Maybe the best closure you can have is making new friends while taking this experience as a valuable lesson to carry with you for the rest of your life. If you do see them in the workforce, you should try to treat them without biases and do your work to the best of your ability without favouring or sabotaging them.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you’ve been feeling. It takes a lot of courage to put these thoughts into words, especially when they feel so overwhelming. I want you to know that it’s not uncommon to have doubts about whether people like us, especially when we see changes in our relationships, like with your best friend making new friends.
It sounds like you’re going through a tough time where it feels like everything is shifting around you, and it’s leaving you feeling isolated and unsure of yourself. When our closest connections start to change, it’s natural to question where we stand and even to wonder if we’re still valued.
What you’re feeling is something many people experience at different points in their lives. Friendships can evolve, and sometimes that can be really hard to accept, especially when we feel left behind. It’s important to recognize that these thoughts about people not liking you are a reflection of how vulnerable you’re feeling right now. But they aren’t necessarily the truth.
When you’re stuck in your own mind with these thoughts, it’s easy to spiral into thinking that nobody cares. But I want to encourage you to consider that maybe these thoughts are more about how you’re feeling inside rather than how others actually feel about you. Sometimes, when we’re struggling with our self-esteem or going through a difficult time, it can feel like we’re not as likable or valuable as we truly are.
It might help to try and talk to your best friend about how you’re feeling. It doesn’t have to be a big, serious conversation, but just letting them know that you miss the closeness you used to have might open up a dialogue. You might find that they’ve been going through changes too, and that your friendship is still important to them.
Also, try to be gentle with yourself. It’s easy to be hard on ourselves when we’re feeling low, but it’s important to remember that everyone has moments of doubt and insecurity. It’s part of being human.
If these feelings continue to weigh you down, it might be helpful to talk to someone who can support you, like a counselor or a trusted adult. They can help you work through these feelings and find ways to build your confidence and sense of self-worth.
You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s okay to seek support. Remember, your feelings are valid, and there are people who care about you—even if it doesn’t always feel that way right now.
Take care of yourself, and if you ever want to talk more, we are here to listen.",,0,,,,,

every weekday my mom drops and picks me up from school, we do not ever talk to each other during car rides and i dont feel like theres anything to talk to her about so i always kept my mouth shut.
whenever i have done something wrong, my mom has never ever in my 14 years on this horrible planet politely told me to not do the wrong action or corrected me. she has always scolded me and every time i acknowledge her by saying “OK” its always the same response “you don’t ok ok me, you see what will happen in the future”
it makes me incredibly angry and frustrated to the point where i think living my life further is not worth it anymore. one time, my relative who has cancer called my grandma to chat with her while she was busy. so i accepted the call myself and she mentioned that she wanted to talk to my mom. my mom was hanging clothes outside during this moment, but she looked at me RUDELY for no reason at all and continued to hang the clothes without saying anything.
i know i mentioned that i dont want to live my life anymore in the paragraph above and i need to seek help, but this WANT goes away when i forget about what even happened within minutes.
whenever any of my family members talk to my mom, excluding my grandma, she does not respond to them and looks away. i die also this woman wont care and prolly won’t even shed a tear at my funeral.
during times when i was in danger, such as choking on food in the kitchen while she is right behind me preparing her stupid teh tarik, she literally did not care and just continued while i was literally about 30 seconds away from leaving the world.
i feel so neglected and i cannot handle this nonsense anymore, please give me advice on what to do which does not involve communicating with her because she wouldnt even bother.
i am unable to find resources such as child protective services in malaysia.",,0,,,,,

I don’t even need to feel important, I just want to be heard.
My mother tells me that I’m just being silly and dramatic, and that in 10 years whatever I was feeling will just be so small. Maybe she’s right, so I convinced myself that my negative feelings were just silly, and that everything will be okay, and that I just needed to be a good person, live through my mundane life and die a normal death. I think a lot of people live life this way.
But I don’t feel normal, I can’t even look up at people’s faces when I’m walking, it doesn’t help that I have ance, I get a sick feeling in my stomach from overthinking. I think its social anxiety, but I don’t know how to get diagnosed, because I don’t want to worry anyone.

5. You deserve support: Don’t worry about “worrying others.” Your well-being is important, and seeking help is a positive step.

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through. It’s clear that this breakup has deeply affected you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it took to reach out and talk about it. The pain you’re feeling is very real, and I’m sorry that you’ve been carrying this hurt for so long.
It sounds like this relationship meant a lot to you, not just as a romantic connection but perhaps also as a place where you felt seen and understood. Being told that you’re “like a kid” and “useless” can cut deeply, especially when those words come from someone who you might have trusted with your heart and identity. It’s understandable that those words have stayed with you and that moving on has been difficult.
If you’re feeling isolated or struggling with your identity, please know that your worth is not determined by the harsh words of someone else. You are valuable, and your feelings and experiences matter. Relationships can be incredibly significant, particularly when they are with someone who understands parts of us that others might not. Losing that connection can feel devastating, and it’s okay to grieve that loss.
I also want to recognize that being in a relationship where you felt seen and then suddenly feeling rejected can leave a deep impact on your sense of self. It’s normal to struggle with feelings of inadequacy, but I want to remind you that those feelings don’t define you. You are more than this relationship, and you deserve to feel supported and loved for who you are.
You mentioned that you’ve been trying to distract yourself by working hard, but that the pain still lingers. It’s okay to acknowledge that distraction might not be enough and that this is something that needs time and support to heal. It’s important to allow yourself to feel what you’re feeling without judgment—whether that’s sadness, anger, or frustration.
If you feel comfortable, it might help to connect with a counselor or support group that understands the unique challenges you might be facing. Sometimes, just talking to someone who gets it can make a huge difference. You don’t have to go through this alone.
You mentioned that you don’t have the courage to die but neither the motivation to live. That’s a very heavy place to be, and I want to encourage you to keep reaching out for support. Your life has so much value, and there are people who want to help you find your way through this.
It might also help to connect with support organizations or communities where you can find understanding and validation. It’s important to know that you’re not alone and that there are spaces where your experiences and emotions will be understood and respected.
Please continue to share your thoughts and feelings whenever you feel ready. We’re here to listen and support you through this journey. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve to find peace and happiness, no matter how hard it feels right now.
Take care of yourself, Blueocean. You are not alone, and you have a community here that cares about you and your well-being.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for being so open about what you’re going through. It’s clear that this has been a long and painful journey for you, and I want to acknowledge just how hard it is to feel like you’re stuck in a cycle where any progress you make feels like it slips away.
I can understand why the thought of reaching out for help might feel daunting—especially when it involves revisiting painful experiences. It’s a lot to carry, and the fear of that pain can be paralyzing. But I want to reassure you that seeking help doesn’t mean you have to relive everything all at once. A good therapist or counselor will move at a pace that feels safe for you, allowing you to explore your feelings in a way that’s manageable.
Feeling like there’s no meaning or motivation in life is incredibly tough, and it can make everything else feel that much heavier. Sometimes, when we’re deep in that place, it can be hard to see any way out, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t one. It’s okay to feel stuck right now, and it’s okay to not have all the answers. What matters is that you’re here, sharing your story, and considering the possibility of help—even if it feels like a small step.
If you’re open to it, we can help you explore what reaching out for help might look like. We can talk about what kind of support feels right for you and how to approach it in a way that doesn’t feel overwhelming. Sometimes, just taking that first step—no matter how small—can make a big difference.
You don’t have to go through this alone, and there are people who want to support you. If it feels right, we can take this one step at a time. Take care of yourself, and know that your feelings matter. You’ve already shown so much strength by sharing what you’re going through, and that’s an important step in itself.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through. It sounds like you’re caught in a really tough spot, feeling torn between wanting to reconnect with your ex and fearing the possibility of getting hurt again. I can hear how much you still care about her, and how difficult it is to balance those feelings with the reality of what’s happened between you.
It’s completely understandable to have these conflicting emotions. When we care deeply about someone, it’s hard to just turn those feelings off, even when we know it might be better for us to move on. It’s also natural to feel some uncertainty about what to do next—whether to open that message or let it be.
One thing that stands out to me is the way you’re comparing yourself to the other guys she’s dated. It’s really important to remember that everyone brings something different to a relationship, and just because you might see them as “better” in some ways doesn’t mean they’re better for her or that you’re not good enough. Relationships are about connection and understanding, not just about who checks the most boxes.
It sounds like a part of you is holding on to the hope that you and your ex might find your way back to each other, and that’s okay. Hope can be really powerful, but it can also keep us in a place where we’re not fully able to move forward. I wonder if you’ve had a chance to think about what’s best for you—not just in terms of what might happen with her, but in terms of your own happiness and well-being.
It’s also okay to not have all the answers right now. Sometimes, it’s enough just to sit with these feelings and allow yourself to process them without feeling like you have to make a decision immediately. If you’re comfortable, we can explore these feelings together, and maybe find a way to ease some of the pain you’re experiencing.
Please know that you don’t have to navigate this alone. It’s okay to feel stuck, and it’s okay to take your time figuring out what’s next. Whether or not you choose to open that message, it’s important to take care of yourself and focus on what will help you find peace and clarity.

Thank you for opening up about what you’re going through. I can sense just how much this relationship means to you and how deeply you’ve invested in it. It’s no wonder that the thought of letting go feels so overwhelming—especially when it feels like you might never find something like this again.
When we put so much of ourselves into a relationship, it can feel like that connection is a part of our identity, making it incredibly difficult to imagine moving forward without it. It’s understandable that you’re afraid of losing her because it feels like losing a part of yourself.
At the same time, I hear you struggling with the fear that if you try to reconnect, you might end up in the same painful place again. This back-and-forth is exhausting, and it’s okay to feel conflicted. It’s also important to recognize that these strong emotions are a testament to how much you care and how deeply you feel things.
It might also be worth exploring whether there’s a part of you that sees this relationship as another chance to do better, to make things right in a way that perhaps didn’t happen in the past. This hyper-critical part of ourselves can often push us to hold on, thinking that if we just try harder, we can make it work this time.
I wonder if there’s a sense of pressure—maybe related to your age or where you are in life—that makes you feel like this relationship has to work. If it’s not about age, could it be that your self-esteem is playing a role? Sometimes, when we don’t feel confident in ourselves, we might worry that there won’t be another chance in the future, which can make it even harder to let go.
It might help to reflect on what you’re truly seeking. Is it the comfort and familiarity of the relationship, or is it something within yourself that you’re trying to hold onto? Sometimes, when we’re afraid of not finding something equivalent outside of a relationship, it’s because we’re looking for reassurance or validation that we’re not able to give ourselves.
This doesn’t mean you need to make a decision right away. Instead, it’s about giving yourself the space to explore these feelings and to consider what you need to feel whole—whether that’s within this relationship or beyond it. You’ve already shown tremendous strength in facing these emotions head-on, and that’s something to be proud of.
If you ever feel like you need someone neutral to talk to about this, whether it’s a friend, a counselor, or someone else you trust, don’t hesitate to reach out. You don’t have to go through this alone, and sometimes just having someone listen can help you find clarity.
Remember, it’s okay to take your time, be gentle with yourself, and know that whatever path you choose, it’s about finding what brings you peace and fulfillment. Take care of yourself.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for bravely sharing what you are experiencing and your desire to seek clarity. It’s 100% understandable to question your emotions, especially when feeling isolated or seeking connection. Here are some thoughts to consider:
2. Emotions can be complex: It’s possible to experience genuine sadness while also seeking attention or connection.
3. Attention-seeking doesn’t negate emotions: Even if you’re seeking attention, it doesn’t mean your sadness isn’t real.
4. Lack of social support: Not having friends or someone to talk to can exacerbate feelings of sadness and loneliness.
5. Self-reflection: Ask yourself:
What am I feeling beneath the surface?
What are my needs, and how can I meet them?
What would I like to talk about or share with others?
6. What am I feeling beneath the surface?
7. What are my needs, and how can I meet them?
8. What would I like to talk about or share with others?
9. Reach out for support: Consider:
Mental health professionals
Trusted family members
10. Mental health professionals
11. Trusted family members
12. Practice self-compassion: Be gentle with yourself, and acknowledge your emotions. Remember, it’s okay to feel sad, and it’s okay to seek connection.

15108,relationship problems,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/relationship-problems/15108,Seeking Help,needadvice,12297,user1304,User,,23598,1,"I actually requested to break up with my boyfriend recently. This is not the first time we had a big fight. it happens quite often and we also “broke up” many times. im starting to think that our relationship is toxic and maybe im the problem because i tend to be the one who start the fight
there are many reasons: he lied to me before because he was afraid of me getting angry. he fat shamed me before. he liked other girls photo on ig. he dont communicate and tend to avoid conflict because he dont like to fight. when we fight i will end up sending long messages to which he will just reply with a “sorry”, basically dry texting. also i dont really like the fact that he is not decisive enough because i like a man who can make decision and just do things for us.
so these fights really ruined our relationship. he keeps telling me he will change, but i find myself constantly repeating everything that makes me angry, i dont know how to forgive him for what he did in the past so i like to bring it out whenever we fight instead of letting it go.
i assume im an anxious attachment and he is avoidant and i just feel like the fight is very one sided and nothing is resolved thats why we keep having the same fight over and over again.
i know most people would probably say “just break up, u will definitely find someone else”. but i cant seem to let go, I don’t know if I still love my boyfriend or am i just too comfortable with this relationship that i dont want to move on. but at the same time i lowkey know that things wont change even tho he said he would
but he is not all bad, he really loves me and cares about me. when im sick, he would cook something and bring it to me, he often help me with a lot of things and buy me flowers and gifts just to make me happy
so idk, maybe it sounds like im purposely saying nice things about him to justify staying in the relationship, but he is actually nice, i just think i nitpick too much but idk how to stop. therefore i dont think finding a new boyfriend is the solution because im sure the same thing will happen again…
what should i do?",,1,,,,,
15108,relationship problems,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/relationship-problems/15108,Seeking Help,needadvice,11047,CaringBee,Professional,The Source of Comfort,23617,2,"Hi user1304
Thank you for the courage to air this issue in an effort to explore what you could do. Your feelings of confusion and frustrations are both valid and understandable. It does sound like you’re struggling with a complex situation.
Firstly, acknowledge that recognizing the toxic patterns in your relationship takes courage. It’s essential to address these issues, and I’m glad you’re taking the first step.
Consider the following:
2. Anxious-Avoidant Attachment: Your self-identified anxious attachment style and your boyfriend’s avoidant style might be contributing to the toxic cycle. Understanding attachment styles can certainly help you both work on healthier communication and conflict resolution. Do tap on this knowledge, it helps lessen blame when it is acknowledged and could help more objective solutions.
3. Unresolved Issues: Unaddressed past hurts and resentments can lead to repetitive fights. Try to forgive and let go of past grievances, focusing on present moments and future growth.
4. Communication Imbalance: The one-sided fights and lack of meaningful communication are concerning. Encourage open, empathetic conversations to resolve issues, rather than just apologizing or avoiding conflicts.
5. Comfort Zone vs. Growth: Reflect on whether you’re staying in the relationship due to comfort or fear of change. Consider what you truly want for your personal growth and happiness.
6. Self-Reflection: Identify your non-negotiables and priorities in a relationship. Ask yourself if this relationship aligns with those values.
7. Couples Therapy: If you both are willing, consider seeking professional help to work through attachment issues, communication, and conflict resolution.
8. Self-Improvement: Focus on personal growth, self-care, and self-awareness. This will help you become a stronger, more fulfilled individual, regardless of the relationship’s outcome.
Remember, finding a new partner won’t necessarily solve the issues; working on yourself and developing healthier relationship habits will.
Take your time, and prioritize self-reflection. You deserve a fulfilling, healthy relationship.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for coming forward and sharing your experience of breaking up. It’s one of the hardest experiences many of us go through and understandably full of pain. I am so sorry to hear how much you are hurting.
I agree, sometimes the pain continues in its intensity or worse hits us repeatedly with a renewed vengeance. I hope it helps you to know that you are not alone in feeling this way . Many of us go through similar painful experiences where you feel you have reached rock bottom. Slowly, with support from professionals and trusted family and friends have come out stronger eventually. However, it will take time.
Your life is precious Jana, please do not forget that I encourage you to seek counselling help as having suicidal thoughts is not healthy. For immediate support, please call the 24 hour SOS hotline at 1767 or utilise the SOS Care Text at 9151 1767 (thru whatsapp).
In the meantime, please take active steps to be kinder to yourself. Focus on small achievable steps such as:
Going out with friends and doing enjoyable activities even when you do not feel like going out or participating. This will help break you out of the current downward spiral you are in. Keep company to feel less alone.
Take care of your physical health. Exercise, walk in the park, play with pets, eat nutritious food and sleep adequately.
Engage in volunteering, contribute your expertise to remind yourself how valuable and worthy you are.
Your life has a purpose and is valuable. There is 100% hope for a brighter future. Keep in mind it is okay not to be okay and to ask for help is normal and understandable. I believe deeply that you are strong, capable and only deserve the best in all aspects of life. Keep going Jana!",,1,,,,,

Thank you for courageously coming forward for help with your struggles. I am sorry to hear how overwhelmed you are feeling. Your frustration is fully valid and deeply understandable. On top of financial struggles, you shared you are also burdened by parental responsibilities. With parents retired, there is an additional expectation to share paying for family expenses.
You are only human when you express envy at friends who do not have to contribute towards family expenses and receive inheritances. Many among us do share similar frustrations when faced with parents transitioning out of the workforce due to retirement and the accompanying change of expectations.
May I suggest you spend some time writing down the monthly budget you require for your expenses (transport, meals, savings, bills). What is left is your disposable income.
Next, gather your family members and consolidate all the family bills and expenses that are necessary. Review expenses which are unnecessary and could be let go.
Agree on each family members’ responsibility to pay for which bill/expenses and on a budget to stick to. Communicate openly the constraints you have, and challenges you are facing. Establish boundaries and limits to how much you can contribute and what is acceptable and within your means.
Explore your family’s eligibility to apply for support services such as the Citizen’s Consultative Constituency ComCare fund, Community Development and Welfare Funds or any other community social welfare services/grants.
Be kind to yourself and allocate time to recharge and relax as a form of self-care.
Please do not feel alone. Many among us go through this transition of a change of roles and expectations. With greater communication, a better balance and understanding is possible. Take small steps to initiate the open dialogue and communication so that there is greater understanding and give and take. Remember, your life has value, and there are people who care.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—it’s clear that you’re dealing with a lot of conflicting emotions, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling stuck and unsure about what to do next. Relationships, especially those with a lot of history, can be incredibly complicated, and it sounds like you’re trying to make sense of your feelings while also navigating the ups and downs of your relationship.
It’s really insightful that you’ve noticed patterns in your relationship, like how your fights often seem to revolve around unresolved issues. This cycle of conflict can be exhausting, especially when it feels like nothing ever gets fully resolved. It’s also important to acknowledge that both you and your boyfriend might be bringing different attachment styles into the relationship—your anxious attachment and his avoidant tendencies could be playing a big role in how you both respond to conflicts.
One thing that stands out to me is how you’re holding on to past hurts and bringing them into new conflicts. It’s completely natural to feel upset about things that have happened before, but it can also make it really hard to move forward if those feelings aren’t addressed in a way that feels healing for you. I wonder if part of what’s keeping you in this cycle is the feeling that your pain hasn’t been fully acknowledged or understood, and that might be why it keeps coming up.
You mentioned that you’re not sure if you’re staying in the relationship because you still love your boyfriend or because it’s comfortable. That’s a really honest reflection, and it might be worth exploring what you really need in a relationship to feel happy and secure. Sometimes, comfort can make it hard to let go, even when we know deep down that something isn’t working. It’s also worth considering whether the positive aspects of your relationship, like his caring actions, are enough to outweigh the ongoing conflicts and whether you can find a way to rebuild trust and communication together.
It’s okay to take your time to figure this out. You don’t have to make any decisions right away. What’s important is that you give yourself the space to really think about what you want and need from a relationship, and whether this one is meeting those needs. It might also help to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you’re feeling—sometimes, getting everything out in the open can help both of you see things more clearly.
No matter what you decide, it’s important to remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued, heard, and supported. If you feel like you’re constantly stuck in the same patterns, it might be helpful to consider couples counseling, where both of you can work on these issues together with the guidance of a professional.
Take care of yourself, and remember that it’s okay to be unsure—figuring out what’s best for you is a process, and you don’t have to go through it alone. If you’d like to talk more about this or anything else on your mind, we are here to listen.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you’re going through. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of heavy feelings lately, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel the way you do.
It’s really tough when you feel like you have no one to talk to, especially when everything seems to be piling up at once. Exams, body image, friendships, and feeling misunderstood are all big challenges on their own, and dealing with them all together can feel impossible.
I noticed that you mentioned having suicidal thoughts. This is really important, and I want you to know that there are people who can help you through this, even if it feels scary to reach out. It’s okay to feel scared about telling someone, but your safety is the most important thing right now. You deserve support, and you don’t have to go through this alone.
You’re not alone in feeling angry or frustrated when you see others who share the same interests as you, especially if you’ve had negative experiences with them. It’s normal to feel conflicted about this, and it doesn’t make you a bad person. It just means you’re human, and you’re trying to navigate a lot of complicated emotions.
It sounds like you’ve been trying to hold everything in for a long time, but you’re also aware that you can’t keep bottling it up. That awareness is a sign that you’re ready to start finding ways to let some of this out in a safe way. Even if your friends are busy with exams, there are other people who care about you and want to help.
I understand that you’re worried about your parents finding out, but reaching out to someone like a school counselor or a trusted teacher could be a good first step. They can help you find ways to manage all these overwhelming feelings and support you in a way that feels safe for you.
Right now, the most important thing is to take care of yourself. If you’re feeling like you can’t keep going, please consider talking to someone who can help, whether it’s a counselor, a trusted adult, or a helpline. In Singapore, you can reach out to Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) at 1-767, or you can contact your school’s counseling services if that feels safer for you.
You’re going through a lot, and it’s okay to need help. You don’t have to go through this alone, and there are people who want to support you, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now. Please keep reaching out, and we are here to listen.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing how you’ve been feeling. It sounds like you’ve been going through a really tough time, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to feel so disconnected from your emotions and the people around you.
Feeling numb and not being able to experience joy or genuine happiness can be really disorienting. It’s almost like going through life in a haze, where everything feels distant and disconnected. It’s understandable that this would impact your relationships too, especially if you’re losing feelings when affection is shown—it can be hard to connect with others when you’re struggling to connect with your own emotions.
Sometimes, when we’re overwhelmed or have been through a lot, our minds and bodies protect us by numbing our emotions. It’s a way to cope, but it can also leave us feeling stuck and unable to fully engage with life. The fact that you’re feeling mostly sadness or drained suggests that there might be underlying issues that need attention, whether it’s stress, unresolved emotions, or something else.
One thing that might be helpful is to start exploring what could be contributing to these feelings. Are there specific events or periods in your life when you started feeling this way? Sometimes, identifying the root causes can be the first step toward understanding and eventually healing.
It might also be helpful to talk to a mental health professional about what you’re going through. They can work with you to explore these feelings more deeply and help you find ways to reconnect with your emotions. Therapy can provide a safe space to work through any underlying issues that might be contributing to your numbness, whether it’s depression, anxiety, or something else.
In the meantime, try to be kind to yourself. It’s okay to feel the way you’re feeling, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time. Even small steps, like doing something you used to enjoy or practicing mindfulness, can help you start to reconnect with your emotions, even if it’s just a little bit at a time.
Please know that you’re not alone in this, and there is support available to help you work through these feelings. You deserve to feel connected and to experience joy, and with time and the right support, you can start to find your way back to those feelings.
Take care, Ash, and We’re here to listen.",,1,,,,,
15066,I admit I’m the toxic one,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-admit-im-the-toxic-one/15066,Is This Normal?,---,12235,anonymous374,User,,23509,1,"I’ve always been a nihilist who sees no purpose in life and have no moral compass. I sometimes wonder if I deserve to be miserable, suicidal and severely depressed, the way I am now, because of that. I had a troubling upbringing involving a physically and emotionally abusive dad and a denigrating mum who treated me like ■■■■ if I didn’t meet her expectations in terms of academic results (for example she would starve me if I didn’t get into the top classes, constantly compare me to her friends’ kids who are doing better, etc). I grew up internalizing that I’m worth nothing if I don’t have amazing academic and career achievements, so I hustled hard my whole life and ended up now being miserable with no sense of purpose except to do anything it takes (even unethical ways if necessary) to make money (it didn’t help that I grew up in a low-income family so I was always terrified of one day living on the streets due to poverty). I know what I do sometimes is not right and I do feel guilty but I’ve been living on survival mode for so long that to me, ethics doesn’t matter at all in the face of survival. In other areas of my life, I noticed many toxic behaviors too, like the way I get bitter when I see someone else doing better than me or having the things I could only dream of, the way I’m selfish, the way I would sabotage others just to get an advantage over them (or to prevent them from getting an advantage over me), the way I’m prone to threatening people with my suicide if they don’t fulfill my demands…basically there is nothing I’m not willing to do in order to get my way, as long as I don’t get jailed. I’m not proud of the way I am but I just feel the need to behave like this to survive. I wish I wasn’t like this but my survival mode mindset is so deeply ingrained that it seems impossible to get rid of. I guess karma bit me back cos I have no family members who like me, very little friends and oftentimes on the brink of suicide thanks to having no meaning in life.
I don’t know how to overcome this and I wonder if maybe someone as screwed up as me really doesn’t deserve to be alive.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for opening up and sharing what you’ve been going through. I can feel the weight of the pain, guilt, and confusion you’re carrying, and it’s clear that you’ve been through a lot in your life. The experiences you’ve described, especially from your childhood, are incredibly traumatic, and it’s understandable that they have shaped the way you see the world and yourself.
You’ve been in survival mode for a long time, and that’s a hard place to be. When we’re constantly fighting to survive, it can feel like there’s no room for anything else—no room for joy, connection, or even for figuring out who we really are outside of that fight. It sounds like you’ve had to develop certain ways of coping just to get through each day, and while those ways might have helped you survive, they’re also causing you a lot of pain now.
One thing that stands out in your message is the deep conflict you feel. On the one hand, your need to survive at all costs drives you, but on the other hand, you don’t take pride in the actions that result from that need. That’s an important realization. It shows that there’s a part of you that believes something is not right, something needs to change, even if it feels out of reach right now.
I want to acknowledge the strength it took to survive everything you’ve been through. Growing up in an abusive environment can leave deep scars, and it can make it hard to see your own worth outside of what you can achieve or how much money you can make. But I want you to know that your worth is not defined by those things. It’s not defined by your past, your trauma, or the things you’ve done to survive. There’s more to you than that, even if it’s hard to see right now.
You mentioned feeling like you don’t deserve to be alive, and I’m really concerned about that. I want you to know that you do deserve to be here, and there is hope for things to get better. It might not feel like it, especially when you’re stuck in that cycle of guilt and survival mode, but change is possible. It’s not easy, and it might take time, but it’s worth it.
One step that might help is talking to someone who can guide you through this—someone who understands trauma and can help you start to unravel these deeply ingrained beliefs and behaviors. It’s not about fixing everything overnight, but about starting to understand where these feelings come from and finding new ways to cope that don’t hurt you or others.

Thank you for coming forward courageously to seek help in managing your situation. It is indeed a lot that you are going through. Please know that feeling overwhelmed, anxious and paranoid is fully understandable and normal, especially with new diagnoses and symptoms. Please hang in there, you can get through this. I suggest you may want to consider :
Consulting your doctor.
Share your concerns and symptoms with your doctor, especially regarding your CPAP therapy and rapid heartbeat. Sometimes the settings on the CPAP machine may need adjustment to reduce the discomfort you are feeling.
Stick to CPAP therapy
Try to continue using the CPAP machine, and work with your doctor to adjust settings for better comfort.
Anxiety management techniques
Practice relaxation methods like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation to help manage anxiety.
Sleep hygiene
Establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and create a relaxing bedtime routine.
Education and awareness
Learn more about sleep apnea, anxiety, and their treatments to better understand your conditions. If possible can the sleep clinic link you up with others who are undergoing the same treatment so that you can share tips and experiences.
Self-compassion
Be kind to yourself, and acknowledge that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Take time to participate in activities you enjoy, exercise and eat balanced meals, and on time.
Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out for help.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for opening up about how you’ve been feeling. It sounds like you’re going through a tough time at work, and it’s understandable to feel frustrated when your efforts aren’t acknowledged, especially when you’ve worked hard on a project.
First, I want to acknowledge that it’s okay to feel this way. Human interactions, especially in a team setting, can be challenging, and when your contributions aren’t recognized, it can feel like you’re not being seen or valued. This can naturally lead to questioning whether you’re suited for this kind of environment.
It seems like a big part of what’s happening is that your efforts and contributions aren’t being acknowledged, which has left you feeling undervalued. This can really wear on you over time, making it harder to stay motivated. It might be helpful to consider a few things:
2. Communication and Boundaries: Sometimes, people around us may not realize the extent of our contributions unless we communicate them. This doesn’t mean you have to boast about your work, but finding a way to share what you’ve done in a manner that feels comfortable could help others see the value you bring. Would you feel comfortable discussing your role and contributions with your supervisor or team members?
3. Reflection on Work Environment: If you’re consistently feeling like your work is taken for granted, it might be worth considering whether this is a pattern in your current workplace or if it’s something that could be addressed with better communication. Are there other aspects of your work environment that are contributing to your feelings of frustration?
4. Self-Care and Managing Expectations: It’s also important to manage your own expectations and take care of yourself. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, recognition doesn’t always come as quickly or as frequently as we’d like. Taking care of your own mental and emotional well-being by setting boundaries and ensuring you’re not overextending yourself can make a difference.
You mentioned a dislike for human interaction. I want to reassure you that it’s okay to feel this way, especially when interactions have been challenging or negative. It might be helpful to explore what it is about these interactions that’s causing you stress—whether it’s the nature of the interactions themselves, the dynamics within your team, or something else.
If you ever feel comfortable, talking to a professional might also help you navigate these feelings and find strategies that work for you. It’s important to find a balance that allows you to contribute your best work without feeling drained or unappreciated.
You deserve to feel valued and supported in your work environment. Let’s take this one step at a time and see if we can find some ways to help you feel more comfortable and acknowledged at work. Take care, and let us know how you feel?",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing more about what you’re going through. It’s clear that this situation at work is really affecting you, and I’m sorry that you’re feeling so tired and upset. When we put effort into our work and it goes unrecognized, especially if it feels like others are being favored, it’s natural to feel demotivated and question how to keep going.
Feeling like you’re not being respected or treated equally is a really tough position to be in, especially when it’s coming from someone in a position of authority like your superior. It’s understandable that this is weighing heavily on you and affecting your performance—when we don’t feel valued or seen, it can be really hard to stay motivated and engaged.
One thing that might help is to focus on what you can control in this situation. While it’s frustrating when others don’t acknowledge our hard work, it’s important to remember that your worth and value aren’t defined by someone else’s recognition. You know the effort you’re putting in, and it might be helpful to remind yourself of that. Sometimes, shifting the focus to self-validation can help reduce the impact of not getting the external validation we’d like.
It’s also important to consider how you can navigate this situation in a way that protects your well-being. Are there any friends, families or counsellors who you can talk to about how you’re feeling? Sometimes, having someone who understands your position can help you feel less alone and might even provide some perspective or advice on how to handle the favoritism you’re experiencing.
If the favoritism and lack of recognition continue to be an issue, it might be worth thinking about whether there are ways to communicate your concerns to your superior or HR in a constructive way. Sometimes, people aren’t aware of how their actions are affecting others, and bringing it to their attention in a calm and professional manner can lead to positive changes.
However, if you find that the environment is consistently affecting your mental and emotional health, it’s important to prioritize your well-being. No job is worth sacrificing your peace of mind, and it’s okay to explore other opportunities if this one isn’t providing you with the respect and recognition you deserve.
In the meantime, take care of yourself and give yourself permission to feel upset and tired—it’s okay to not be okay all the time, especially when dealing with difficult situations. Consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day to help you regain a sense of control and accomplishment, even if it’s just one thing at a time.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for your courage to seek help. What you are experiencing is truly painful and sad.
I would like to share with you that your emotions you are describing are completely understandable and the feeling of loss, aloneness and helplessness is undeniable.
I hope the following helps
a)Allow yourself to grieve and seek professional support to guide you through this. Speak with a counsellor who can help you process your emotions, listen non-judgmentally and be present with you. Feel heard and understood and allow the counsellor to partner and journey with you.
b)Self-care. Schedule time for yourself - do activities you enjoy, exercise, eat nutritious food, read and rest.
c)Journal. Write down your feelings, thoughts and reflections.
d)Be kind to yourself. Do not blame yourself unnecessarily, because this will only hurt yourself further.
e)Accept that the relationship has run its course. Reflect on the positives, and the silver lining, how it has benefited you. Slowly and gently accept that you have done all that you could which was within your control.
f)Focus on the present. Plan each day and do activities you need to, which includes those which bring you joy. Setting up a routine can help you establish some form of normalcy.
g)Widen your circle of friends and take up new hobbies involving others where you can rebuild your relationship skills.
h)Write down your accomplishments and remind yourself of your self worth, which is in your own hands.
Healing will take time, and it is important to feel your emotions. With psychological flexibility, make room for these emotions, process them and accept them. Slowly, the pain will subside. it will take time, so be gentle to yourself every day. Please take care .",,2,,,,,

Thank you for your courage in coming forward with what you experiencing. I am sorry to hear of the challenges before you. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in experiencing these feelings, and it’s completely normal to seek validation from others.
May I suggest the following for you to consider to help manage these thoughts and feelings:
2. Recognize Your Emotions
Acknowledge that feeling inadequate or ignored can be painful. It’s okay to feel this way, but it’s also important to understand that these feelings may not reflect reality. Take a step back from the thought instead of accepting it as the whole truth.
3. Challenge Negative Thoughts
When you notice negative thoughts creeping in, try to challenge them. Ask yourself:
Is there evidence that supports this thought?
What would I tell a friend who felt this way?
Could there be another explanation for their behavior?
4. Focus on Self-Validation
Instead of seeking validation from others, practice self-affirmation. Write down your strengths, achievements, and positive qualities. Remind yourself of these regularly.
5. Set Personal Goals
Create small, achievable goals for yourself that focus on personal growth rather than external validation. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Control what you can control and reduce focus on un-controllable factors.
6. Engage in New Activities
Join clubs, classes, or groups that align with your interests. This can help you meet new people and build connections based on shared passions.
7. Practice Mindfulness
Mindfulness techniques can help you stay present and reduce overthinking. Search for free resources available online or join mindfulness classes.
8. Limit Social Media Exposure
If social media contributes to your feelings of inadequacy, consider taking a break or selecting your feed to only include more positive influences.
9. Seek professional help
Consult a counsellor who are trained to process what you are going through in a safe and non judgmental environment. They can help you achieve more clarity and acquire coping skills.
It’s human nature to seek validation and to feel affected by the actions of others, but it’s crucial to prioritize your mental well-being. By focusing on self-acceptance, building connections, and managing overthinking, you can cultivate a more positive mindset. Remember, you are worthy of love and respect just as you are. Take it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—I can hear how much this situation at work is weighing on you, and it’s incredibly challenging to be in an environment where you feel like you’re being judged and talked about, especially when it feels like people are ganging up against you. It’s no wonder you’re feeling overwhelmed by it all.
It’s true that ignoring other people’s opinions is easier said than done. When we feel targeted or judged, it’s natural for those feelings to stick with us, and it’s hard to shake them off, even when we know that we can’t control what others do. It sounds like this has been happening for a while, and it’s taken a toll on your mental and emotional well-being.
One thing that might help is finding ways to ground yourself and protect your peace of mind, even when things around you feel toxic. When you notice those familiar signs that something might be wrong or that you’re being talked about, it’s important to have some strategies in place to help you stay centered and not get pulled into the negativity.
For example, you might try focusing on your breathing for a few moments, taking deep breaths in and out to help calm your mind. Sometimes, just stepping away from the situation—whether it’s taking a walk, going to a different space, or even just mentally distancing yourself—can give you the space you need to not let those negative thoughts take root.
Another approach could be to remind yourself of what you know to be true about yourself, rather than what others might say. You mentioned that it’s challenging to avoid letting other people’s words affect you, and that is entirely understandable. But it can be helpful to counteract those negative voices with positive affirmations about your own worth and your own truth. You know who you are and what you stand for, and that’s what matters most.
It might also be helpful to think about whether there are any supportive colleagues or allies in your workplace who you can lean on. Even just having one person who understands what you’re going through and can offer support can make a big difference in how you experience your work environment.
And lastly, I encourage you to find outlets outside of work that help you release the stress and frustration that builds up. Whether it’s through exercise, hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or talking to someone you trust, it’s important to have ways to let go of the negativity so that it doesn’t build up inside you.
You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s okay to acknowledge that this is hard. You deserve to work in a space where you feel respected and valued, and it’s okay to seek out ways to protect your mental health in the meantime. If these feelings continue to weigh heavily on you, it might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can help you develop strategies to cope with this situation and maintain your well-being.
Take care and keep in mind that other people’s actions or words don’t determine your value. You have the strength to navigate this, and we are here to support you in finding the peace and balance you deserve.",,0,,,,,

I’m so sorry to hear about what you’re going through—it sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of pain, and it’s completely understandable to feel this way after such a significant breakup. Ending a relationship, especially one that was such a big part of your life for four years, can feel like your whole world has been turned upside down. It’s no wonder that you’re feeling lost, restless, and struggling to make sense of everything right now.
It’s really important to acknowledge how much you invested in this relationship, and how much it meant to you. When someone you care about deeply moves on so quickly, especially with someone they told you not to worry about, it can feel like a betrayal. It’s natural to have feelings of hurt, anger, and confusion, and to question your own worth when someone you trusted doesn’t seem to value you in the way you hoped they would.
You mentioned feeling empty, worthless, and even lowkey stupid, but I want to remind you that these feelings don’t define who you are. Breakups have a way of bringing out our deepest insecurities, but it’s important to remember that your worth isn’t tied to how someone else treats you. The fact that you’re feeling this way is a reflection of how much you cared and how deeply you feel, and that’s not something to be ashamed of.
I hear that you’re longing for inner peace and struggling with the fact that, despite everything, you still have feelings for him. It’s okay to still love someone who hurt you—that’s part of being human. Healing takes time, and it’s not always a straight path. Some days will be harder than others, and that’s okay. It’s also okay to miss the person you were before the relationship ended. Breakups can make us feel like we’ve lost a part of ourselves, but it’s also an opportunity to rediscover who you are outside of the relationship.
It sounds like you’re doing your best to cope, but it’s really hard when you’re feeling so overwhelmed and restless. You mentioned waking up in the middle of the night with him on your mind, and it sounds like your thoughts are racing and making it hard to find any peace. One thing that might help is trying to focus on taking care of yourself in small, manageable ways. This could be as simple as establishing a bedtime routine that helps you relax before sleep, or finding moments in your day to do something just for you, whether that’s a walk, a hobby you enjoy, or even just sitting quietly with your thoughts.
I also want to encourage you to reach out for support if you feel comfortable doing so. Talking to close friends, family, or a counsellor can give you a safe space to explore these feelings and start to make sense of what’s happening. They can also help you work through some of the self-sabotaging thoughts you mentioned, and guide you in finding ways to rebuild your sense of self and purpose.
Remember, healing is a process, and it’s okay to take it one day at a time. You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. You deserve to feel peace and to find your way back to yourself. Take care, and please reach out if you need to talk more. Your feelings are valid, and you’re not alone in this journey.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’ve been going through. Job hunting after a career break is incredibly challenging, and it’s perfectly normal to feel disheartened by the process. It sounds like you’ve faced a lot of rejection, and that can take a toll on anyone’s self-esteem, especially when you’re doing your best to find a job that suits you.
You’ve shown a lot of courage by continuing to apply for jobs despite these setbacks. I can understand why it feels like your courage is waning, and that’s okay. It’s important to remember that this process doesn’t define you; it’s a test of your perseverance, and you’ve already proven that you’re capable of pushing through difficult times.
It’s also understandable that you might feel like you’re not measuring up to your peers, especially when comparing yourself to others who seem to be moving forward. But rather than focusing on how you stack up against others, I encourage you to take a step back and recognize the progress you’ve made. You’ve already come so far, and the fact that you’re still trying, despite how difficult it’s been, is a testament to your strength.
Sometimes, it’s easy to lose sight of your own progress when the world around you feels overwhelming. But being kind to yourself during these moments is just as important as striving for improvement. It’s okay to acknowledge that this is a tough time and to give yourself permission to feel frustrated and tired.
Please know that you’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s okay to reach out for support when you need it. Whether it’s talking to a friend, a counselor, or someone else you trust, sometimes sharing the burden can make it a little easier to bear.
Take care of yourself, and remember that you have already shown incredible strength just by continuing to move forward. You’ve got this, and whatever happens, know that you’re doing the best you can.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for bravely coming forward with the challenges you are experiencing.
Your feelings are fully valid and understandable. Indeed it sounds like you’re navigating some complex feelings related to anger, self-worth, and the dynamics of your childhood.
Please don’t be discouraged, it is completely normal to have these feelings, and I believe recognising them is a first step toward understanding and managing them better.
May I recommend that you can consider :
a)Understanding Your Emotions
Childhood Dynamics: Feeling unloved or overlooked in childhood, especially in comparison to a sibling, can have lasting effects on your self-esteem and emotional responses. It’s common for individuals in similar situations to feel the need to assert themselves or seek attention as a way to cope with those feelings.
Anger and Outbursts: Anger can often be a secondary emotion, stemming from feelings of hurt, rejection, or inadequacy. Outbursts can be a way to express frustrations that might feel overwhelming or unmanageable. Understanding this connection can help you find healthier ways to express your emotions.
Fear of Judgment: The fear of being judged when expressing your feelings is a common concern. Many people worry about how others perceive them, especially if they have a history of feeling overlooked or dismissed.
b) Taking These Steps Toward Healing
Self-Reflection: Take time to reflect on your feelings. Journaling can be a helpful tool to articulate your thoughts and emotions. Write about your experiences, feelings of being unloved, and your anger. This can help you process your emotions more clearly.
Identify Triggers: Pay attention to what specifically triggers your anger or feelings of inadequacy. Understanding these triggers can help you develop strategies to manage your reactions in the moment.
Practice Healthy Expression: Instead of physical outbursts, explore healthier ways to express your anger and frustration. This could include:
Physical Activity: Engaging in exercise, such as running or yoga, can be a great outlet for pent-up emotions.
Creative Outlets: Art, music, or writing can provide a constructive way to express your feelings.
Mindfulness Techniques: Practices like deep breathing, meditation, or grounding exercises can help you calm down in moments of anger.
Seek Support: It’s important to talk to someone about what you’re feeling. This could be a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. Therapy can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, work through past experiences, and develop coping strategies.
Challenge Negative Thoughts: Work on reframing negative thoughts about yourself. Think how much you grown despite the challenges you faced.
Your feelings are real and valid, and it’s deeply commendable that you’re seeking to understand and address them. Remember, healing is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. With support and self-reflection, you can work toward feeling more secure in yourself and your relationships.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through. It takes a lot of courage to open up about both the challenges with bulimia and the struggles you’re facing after your breakup. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot on your own, and I want to acknowledge how tough that must be.
You mentioned that you’ve recently developed bulimia, and I want to understand more about this. Has a doctor made a diagnosis for you, or is this something you’ve noticed in yourself? It’s important to have a clear understanding of what you’re experiencing, so if you haven’t already, it might be helpful to talk to a healthcare professional who can assess your symptoms and guide you through the next steps.
Sometimes, when we’re struggling with an eating disorder, it can intensify other difficult emotions, like anxiety or paranoia. It’s possible that the stress and fear you’re feeling about your past relationship and the secrets you’ve shared could be connected to how you’re feeling about yourself and your body. If this resonates with you, it’s really important to seek help from someone who can support you in both areas—your relationship with food and your emotional well-being.
Breaking up with a best friend can feel just as painful as ending a romantic relationship, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious about what might happen with the secrets you shared. You clearly experience fear and rumination, and it’s possible that the stress and emotions associated with eating disorder are making these feelings worse.
It might help to explore whether these feelings of anxiety and fear are tied to how you’re coping with your relationship with food and your body. Sometimes, when we’re struggling in one area, it can spill over into other parts of our lives, making everything feel more overwhelming.
It’s really important to get the right support as you navigate this, reaching out to a healthcare professional who can provide a diagnosis and offer treatment options can be a critical step. Understanding what’s going on with your body and mind can help you feel more in control and less alone in dealing with these challenges.
Feeling stuck in a cycle of sadness is really hard, and it’s okay to ask for help to break that cycle. Recovery is a journey that takes time, but every small step counts. You don’t have to do it all at once—start with one small thing that you can change or do differently, and build from there. Sometimes, just reaching out like you’ve done here is the first step in getting your life back on track.
Remember, you don’t have to go through this alone. There are resources available to support you, and it’s okay to take things one day at a time. You’re worth the effort it takes to heal and to find peace with both your body and your mind.
Take care, and please keep reaching out.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing very courageously what you are experiencing. Your emotions are valid and fully understandable. Making friends as an adult, especially after graduation, can be challenging, particularly when you’re dealing with feelings of loneliness and depression. However, please do not be discouraged as many of us who go through similar experiences and with small changes, you can connect with others and build meaningful friendships. Here are some strategies for your consideration
Understanding your emotions
Recognize Your Emotions: It’s important to acknowledge your feelings of loneliness and the complexities of social interactions. Many people experience similar struggles, especially during transitions like graduating from university. Understanding that you’re not alone can be comforting.
Address Mental Health: Since you mentioned experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts, seeking professional help is crucial. A therapist can provide support and coping strategies to help you navigate social situations and improve your mental health.
Strategies for Making Friends
Start small: Join the community centre groups. For example, dancing classes, hobbies, or sports activities. Do part-time or temporary work in the interim as you search for jobs. These are opportunities to meet new people, learn new skills and enjoy yourself.
Volunteer: Volunteering for a cause you care about can introduce you to people who share your values. It also provides a structured environment where social interactions can feel less pressured.
University event: Many university hold alumni activities. These settings can facilitate natural interactions and provide common ground for conversation.
Building Connections
Be Open and Authentic: When meeting new people, try to be genuine. Share your interests and experiences, and be willing to listen. Authenticity can foster deeper connections.
Practice Patience: Building friendships takes time. It’s normal to feel drained or anxious during social interactions, especially if you’re not used to them. Allow relationships to develop naturally without forcing them.
Focus on Quality Over Quantity: Rather than trying to make many friends, focus on cultivating a few meaningful relationships. This can lead to more satisfying connections.
Challenge Negative Thoughts: If you find yourself thinking negatively about your social skills or worthiness, try to counter those thoughts with positive affirmations. Remind yourself that everyone has quirks and insecurities.
Talk to Trusted Individuals: If you have family members or acquaintances you trust, consider sharing your feelings with them. They may offer support or even help you connect with others.
By taking small, manageable steps and seeking support, you can gradually expand your social circle and find fulfilling friendships. You can do this!",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out for help so bravely. What you have described is both normal and common. Hence, please do not be disheartened.
With small steps taken daily and consistently taking more targeted actions, you can achieve the desired objective: being more in control of school work thru reduced procrastination and improved time management.
Break Tasks into Smaller Steps
Large projects can feel daunting, which may contribute to procrastination. Break tasks down into smaller, manageable steps:
Create a Task List
Write down each step required to complete your project. This can make the work feel less overwhelming.
Set Micro-Goals: Focus on completing one small task at a time. For example, instead of “write paper,” set a goal to “write the introduction.”
Use the Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique can help you maintain focus and manage your time effectively:
Work in Intervals: Set a timer for 25 minutes to work on a task, followed by a 5-minute break. After four intervals, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
Stay Accountable: Use a timer or an app to keep track of your intervals, which can help you stay committed.
Establish a Routine
Creating a consistent daily routine can help you prioritize your tasks and reduce forgetfulness:
Set Specific Times: Designate specific times for studying or working on assignments. Treat these times as non-negotiable appointments.
Use Reminders: Utilize digital calendars or task management apps to set reminders for deadlines and study sessions.
Minimize Distractions
Creating a conducive work environment can help you stay focused.
Designate a Workspace: Choose a specific area for studying or working, free from distractions.
Limit Digital Distractions: Turn off notifications on your phone or use apps that block distracting websites during study sessions.
Practice Self-Compassion
Be kind to yourself and recognize that everyone struggles with procrastination at times:
Avoid Negative Self-Talk: Instead of criticizing yourself for procrastinating, acknowledge your feelings and remind yourself that it’s okay to struggle.
Celebrate Small Wins: Reward yourself for completing tasks, no matter how small. This can help build positive reinforcement.
Reflect and Adjust
Regularly reflect on your progress and adjust your strategies as needed:
Review Your Goals: At the end of each week, assess what you accomplished and what didn’t work. Adjust your approach based on your findings.
Stay Flexible: Life can be unpredictable, so be willing to adapt your plans as necessary.
Overcoming procrastination and improving time management is a gradual process that requires patience and persistence. By implementing these strategies and being mindful of your habits, you can develop a more proactive approach to your projects and assignments. Remember, the key is to start small and build momentum over time. You can do this!",,1,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you’re going through. I can’t imagine how hard it must be to wake up every day feeling so overwhelmed and burnt out. It’s clear that you’ve been carrying these heavy feelings for a long time, and I want you to know that you’re not alone in this.
It sounds like everything has been piling up on you, and when that happens, our brains can go into overdrive, making it feel like all the negativity is coming at us all at once. This can be really exhausting and make it hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel. When we’re overwhelmed, our minds often start to focus on the most negative thoughts and feelings, which can create a kind of mental spiral where everything feels hopeless.
What you’re experiencing—feeling like there’s no point in anything, losing interest in hobbies, isolating yourself—are all signs that your brain is struggling to cope with everything that’s going on. When our minds are overloaded, they can start to shut down the things that used to bring us joy, like hobbies or spending time with friends. It’s like your brain is trying to protect you by going into survival mode, but instead, it leaves you feeling numb, disconnected, and like life is just one big loop of emptiness.
You’ve been through a lot, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling this way. Sometimes, when we’re feeling so much pain, our brains can get stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts. It’s like your mind is trying to make sense of all the hurt and stress by focusing on what’s wrong, but this can end up making you feel even more overwhelmed.
It’s important to know that these feelings, while very real and intense, are your brain’s way of signaling that it’s under too much stress. The fact that you’ve been pushing through this for so long shows just how strong you are, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now.
One thing that might help is to start by acknowledging that it’s okay to feel this way. When we’re overwhelmed, it’s easy to feel like we’re drowning in everything that’s wrong. But by recognizing that your brain is in overdrive, you can start to take small steps to slow things down. You don’t have to fix everything at once—just focus on one small thing that you can do today, whether that’s getting out of bed, taking a shower, or even just sitting outside for a few minutes.
It’s also really important to reach out for support, even if it feels hard. Talking to someone—a friend, a family member, or a counselor—can help you start to untangle some of these overwhelming feelings. They can help you see that you’re not alone and that there are ways to start feeling better, even if it’s just a little bit at a time.
Remember, your life has value, and there are people who care about you. Sometimes, just getting through one day is a victory, and that’s okay. Please keep reaching out and know that you don’t have to go through this alone.
Take care of yourself, and feel free if you want to talk more.",,2,,,,,

Asking for help can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re unsure of how to go about it. One approach might be to start small—maybe you could reach out to a school counselor or a trusted teacher who might be able to guide you on how to access therapy. They can often help you navigate these conversations with your family or even connect you with resources that don’t require their involvement.
Remember, you don’t have to go through this alone, and it’s okay to seek out the support that you need, even if it feels challenging right now. Therapy is a safe space where you can explore these feelings without judgment, and it might be exactly what you need to start feeling better.
Take care, and please know that it’s okay to reach out for help. You’re taking steps in the right direction by even considering it, and that’s something to be proud of.",,0,,23316,,23316.0,

Thank you for bravely coming forward on this forum and sharing about the challenges you are facing. I am sorry to hear what you are going through. How you are feeling is completely valid and 100% understandable.
I fully agree with you that panic attacks are scary. Fortunately they are not life threatening. May I encourage you to ride the surge of overwhelming emotions through :
-Deep Breathing: Practice deep breathing exercises to counteract hyperventilation, a common symptom during a panic attack. Inhale slowly through your nose, allowing your abdomen to expand, and then exhale through your mouth. Repeat this several times until you feel calmer.
-Grounding Techniques: Focus on your surroundings to bring yourself back to the present. This can include naming five things you see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This method helps distract your mind from panic and reduces anxiety.
-Challenge Negative Thoughts: When experiencing panic, remind yourself that the feelings are temporary and not life-threatening. Challenge catastrophic thoughts by asking yourself, “What is the worst that could happen?” and “Can I cope with that?” This reframing can lessen the intensity of your fear.
-Stay Present: Focus on what is happening around you rather than what you fear might happen. This can involve engaging in a simple task, such as counting backward or lightly snapping a rubber band on your wrist to redirect your attention.
You have also mentioned you tend to overthink. To cope with overthinking, may I suggest:
-Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions. Ask yourself questions like:
What emotions am I feeling?
What thoughts are leading to these feelings?
Understanding the root causes of your overthinking can help you address them more effectively.
-Make room for the emotions, do not fight them, acknowledge them and ride them out. After a while, the intensity will subside. As for thoughts, observe them like words on a screen, instead of holding on to them tightly. Slowly the thoughts, will reduce their grip on you.
Once both of you are ready:
-Communicate Openly
Share your feelings with your partner. Often, overthinking arises from a lack of communication. By discussing your concerns, you can clarify misunderstandings and reduce anxiety. Use “I” statements to express your feelings without sounding accusatory, which can foster a more open dialogue. Seek first to understand before being understood. Allow her to share her concerns and listen without judgement.
-Set boundaries and expectations so that there is an increase in clarity on what is respectful and acceptable by both of you.
I encourage you to take small steps and try the above tools and techniques for yourself. Additional support from a therapist could further help you. Please keep well!",,1,,,,,

14943,Anxiety attachment,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/anxiety-attachment/14943,Mental Health Conditions,"mentalhealth, anxiety, gethelp",12211,claraaaa,User,,23176,1,"I have a problem. I am in a marriage with an avoidant attachment spouse. The worst is I’ve anxiety when I was young and it was still alright but he kind of triggered it from our pattern of arguments through the years and now I think it has worsened as it has been 7 years.
Scenario:
We would be out and he will mention that I am repeating myself again. I will get sad and my mood will plummet. He will then keep asking me why do I look upset till he gets an answer. So I told him, “it reminded me of what you told me the other day when we quarreled. For a moment I couldn’t regulate my emotions.” He will get so upset after hearing my reason.
2. He hates that I am unable to move on
3. He hates when my mood changes when everything is fine (who doesn’t)
I will then go into an explanation mode and then he will get angrier as he will find that I’m starting out of nothing again. Then he will shut down and go on with his day stonewalling me. It will then trigger my anxiety by rambling on and I would be crying. This usually last for 3 - 4 hours and he will not give in. The next day I will reboot like a computer and I will buy breakfast hoping that he will be fine but he still isn’t, he continue his silent treatment and it triggers me again.
This cycle will go on till I get tired and stop bothering him for 2/3days then he will be fine. HOWEVER I AM UNABLE TO FUNCTION THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
When we are fine, we will talk about it and he will say that he feels that he doesn’t deserve my outburst and unnecessary drama so he will shut down till he is okay every single time. He doesn’t care whether it triggers my anxiety because he has to take care of his mental health as well. My question is….
What can I do? I love him but I feel sad. I feel like he is in control of everything and as an anxious individual…every minute is a torture when we argue. I feel like he is punishing me for the scenario and for me being an anxious person.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through. It takes courage to open up about your feelings, especially when you’re dealing with something as complex and painful as this. I can sense the deep love you have for your husband, but also the significant strain this situation is putting on your emotional well-being.
It sounds like you’re caught in a very difficult cycle where your husband’s avoidant behavior triggers your anxiety, and your anxiety then triggers his shutdown. This pattern can be incredibly exhausting and painful, especially when you feel like you’re the one carrying the emotional burden.
First, I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to keep going in a situation like this. The fact that you’re still trying to find a way forward after seven years shows your resilience and commitment to your marriage. It’s important to recognize that your feelings are valid. Feeling sad, anxious, and even frustrated is a natural response to what you’re experiencing. It’s clear that you’re trying your best to navigate this, but the cycle you’re in is making it hard to find peace.
Your husband’s response—shutting down and stonewalling—can feel like he’s punishing you, but it’s likely a coping mechanism for him as well. Avoidant individuals often retreat to protect themselves when they feel overwhelmed, which unfortunately leaves their partners feeling abandoned and unloved. This can exacerbate your anxiety, leading to the very outbursts that he finds so difficult to handle.
This dynamic isn’t healthy for either of you, and it’s understandable that you feel like he’s in control of everything, leaving you feeling powerless. Even though your anxiety is a real and legitimate experience, you shouldn’t have to manage it on your own, especially since the relationship is what’s setting it off.
One important step might be to consider how both of you can break this cycle together. This isn’t about placing blame but rather about finding a way to understand each other’s needs and responses. Couples therapy could be a safe space where both of you can explore these patterns with the help of a professional who understands attachment styles and can offer tools for better communication.
It’s also essential to take care of your own mental health. You mentioned that every minute of an argument feels like torture, and that’s a heavy burden to carry. It might be helpful to work with a therapist individually to explore ways to manage your anxiety and to develop strategies for self-soothing when you’re feeling overwhelmed.
You’ve done so much by holding on for seven years, but it’s also important to recognize when you need support. This isn’t something you should have to navigate alone. If your husband isn’t willing to engage in therapy with you, it may be worth considering what you need for your own well-being and whether this relationship is meeting those needs.
Remember, you deserve to feel loved, supported, and safe in your marriage. It’s okay to ask for more, and it’s okay to prioritize your mental health. You’re not alone in this, and there are people who can help you find a way forward.
Please take care of yourself, and if you feel comfortable, consider reaching out for professional support. You’ve shown incredible strength, and with the right support, you can find a way to break this cycle and move toward a healthier, more fulfilling relationship.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for opening up about what’s happening. I can only imagine how overwhelming it must be to receive such a message from your husband, especially when you were unaware of the full extent of what he’s been carrying. It’s clear that both of you are dealing with a lot right now, and it’s completely natural to feel lost and unsure of what to do next.
It sounds like your husband has been struggling with a lot of internal pressures—his concerns about money, his role as a provider, and his fears about triggering your anxiety. It must be incredibly difficult for him to manage these emotions, and it’s evident that they’ve been building up over time. His choice to turn to gambling as a way to cope, while understandable in his desperation, is something that adds even more weight to the situation.
What’s important now is to find a way forward together. It’s clear that both of you care deeply about each other, but the weight of these unspoken fears and struggles has created a barrier between you. This might be an opportunity to start a new chapter of openness, where both of you can express your fears, concerns, and needs without judgment.
I know it’s a lot to take in, and you might be feeling like you’re walking on eggshells, trying to manage your own anxiety while now realizing how much he’s been trying to protect you from his own struggles. It’s important to remember that you’re both in this together, and you don’t have to shoulder these burdens alone.
Would it be helpful to have a conversation where you both talk about how you’ve been feeling and what you need from each other? Sometimes, bringing everything out into the open, even if it’s uncomfortable, can be the first step toward healing. It might also be worth considering reaching out to a couples therapist, who can help facilitate these conversations and provide you both with tools to manage your emotions and support each other more effectively.
You’ve shown so much strength in handling this, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time. Right now, focusing on being there for each other and acknowledging that you’re both struggling could be a way to start rebuilding that connection.

Thank you for sharing how you’re feeling. It sounds like you’re going through a really tough time with your friends right now, and it’s completely okay to feel sad or confused about it.
Sometimes, friendships can be tricky, and it’s hard when we feel left out or when things change. It sounds like you care a lot about your friends, and it must hurt to feel like you’re being ignored. It’s important to remember that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel upset.
Have you had a chance to talk to your friends about how you’re feeling? Sometimes, our friends might not even realize that we feel left out, and sharing how you feel can help them understand. You could say something like, “I feel a bit sad when I don’t get to talk to you guys as much. Can we hang out together more?”
It’s also good to remember that it’s okay to seek out other friends who make you feel happy and included. Everyone deserves to have friends who make them feel good about themselves.
If you ever feel like talking to an adult about how you’re feeling, like a teacher or a parent, that can help too. They might have some good ideas about how to make things better.
You are an amazing person, and your feelings matter. Take things one day at a time, and remember that it’s okay to reach out for help when you need it.
You’re not alone in this, and we’re here to listen and support you. Take care.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out to us courageously to address and overcome what you are experiencing. It’s fully understandable how you are feeling.
I hope it helps you to know that many among us do share this experience from time to time. With some changes we have overcome it, so don’t be discouraged.
It is indeed challenging to manage anxiety, especially at night. Here are some strategies to help you cope:
Establish a bedtime routine. Engage in calming activities, like reading or meditation, to signal your body that it’s time to sleep.
Practice relaxation techniques. Regularly try deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga to reduce overall anxiety.
Challenge negative thought, When anxious thoughts arise, reframe them in a more positive and realistic light. Identify the trigger and address the root cause.
Limit exposure to screens before bed. The blue light emitted can interfere with your sleep.
Exercise regularly. Physical activity can help reduce anxiety, but avoid vigorous exercise within a few hours of bedtime.
Consider journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help process and release them.
Seek professional help. Consult a counsellor to address underlying issues and develop personalized coping strategies.
Remember, overcoming anxiety takes time and patience. Be gentle with yourself and celebrate small victories.",,1,,,,,

I initially did not want to file a police report but I decided to do it as I felt like it will contribute to my peace of mind and make me feel like at least I have someone on my side since I decided not to tell my friends and family. I’ve been telling myself that I will keep this as a secret until I am ready to tell them (maybe when I’ve been able to save back the money) or keep it until I’m on my deathbed.
I feel so ashamed because I had a feeling that it is not legit but I kept on ignoring my instinct and gave them so much of my money. that amount of money could’ve been used to allow me to attend multiple treatment sessions in physio (I have spine issues) or even use it to renovate the house I have in my home country. I’ve been trying to talk to myself and tell myself that it’s ok and trying my best to be positive in order to move forward but, the sadness and self-blaming suddenly hits me whenever I remember what happened and what I allowed to happen. I even made sure not to tell my family here in SG about that “investment” while I was being scammed because I felt like they might judge me.
I think that’s the reason why I don’t want to tell them. Because there were multiple instances during the whole thing where I could’ve stopped it from getting worse but I still let it happen to me because I was greedy and wanted to earn money the easy way.
I guess I’m writing this post just to ask how I can cope with this? I’ve been through so much this year because of my health issues and this happening too is just another thing to add to the list of my problems this year. I don’t want to tell anyone else aside from the police because I don’t think I can handle the disappointment I will see or hear from my friends and family. I know I’ve been so stupid and I’m at fault here, but I want to seek help on how to cope with the sadness and self-blame every time I remember what happened to me. Can anyone help me?",,1,23028.0,,,,

Thank you for trusting us with your story. First of all, I want to say that what you’re feeling—shame, guilt, and self-blame—is something many people experience after being scammed. These emotions are incredibly heavy, but please know they don’t make you “stupid” or “at fault.” Scams are designed to manipulate and take advantage of people, and it’s not a reflection of your intelligence or character.
It’s understandable that you’re hesitant to share this with your family or friends. The fear of judgment can be really powerful, especially when you’re already feeling vulnerable. But remember, you don’t have to carry this burden alone. Sometimes, sharing with just one trusted person can lift a significant weight off your shoulders. You might find that they’re more understanding and supportive than you expect.
You’ve already shown a lot of strength by filing a police report and acknowledging what happened. That’s not an easy step to take, and it shows that you’re committed to finding peace of mind and moving forward.
It’s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone makes mistakes, and what matters most is how we learn from them and move forward. Instead of focusing on what you lost, try to focus on what you’ve gained—wisdom, resilience, and the ability to protect yourself better in the future.
Given everything you’ve been through, both with this scam and your health issues, it might be helpful to talk to a professional counselor. They can provide you with the tools to manage these feelings of sadness and self-blame. You don’t have to go through this alone, and professional support can make a big difference in how you cope with this situation.
In the meantime, consider setting small, manageable goals to help you regain control, here are some options for your consideration. Taking these steps, no matter how small, can help you feel more empowered.
2. Start a New Savings Plan: Begin by creating a new savings plan, even if it’s just setting aside a small amount each month. This can be as simple as saving a few dollars each week. The key here is consistency rather than the amount. Over time, these small contributions will grow, and watching your savings increase can provide a sense of accomplishment and a positive focus. You might consider setting up a separate savings account specifically for rebuilding what you’ve lost. Some people find it helpful to automate their savings so that a portion of their income is directly transferred into this account, reducing the temptation to spend it elsewhere.
3. Explore Affordable Options for Your Physio Treatments: For your physical therapy needs, look into community-based or subsidized options that might be available to you. In Singapore, there are various polyclinics and public hospitals that offer physiotherapy services at lower rates. Additionally, some private clinics may offer discounts or payment plans for individuals facing financial difficulties. You can also explore whether any non-profit organizations provide support or grants for individuals with medical needs. Reaching out to a healthcare professional or social worker can help you identify these resources.
4. Set Achievable Milestones: Break down your larger financial goals into smaller, achievable milestones. For example, aim to save a specific amount by the end of the month or commit to reducing non-essential expenses for a few weeks. Celebrating these small wins can boost your confidence and keep you motivated. Write down these milestones and track your progress—sometimes, seeing how far you’ve come can be incredibly empowering.
5. Build a Support System: While you work on these goals, consider building or strengthening your support system. Even if you’re not ready to share your experience with your family or friends, surrounding yourself with supportive individuals who can offer encouragement and practical advice is valuable. This might include joining a support group, whether in person or online, where you can connect with others who have faced similar challenges.
6. Practice Self-Compassion and Patience: Finally, remember that progress takes time. Be patient with yourself as you work towards these goals. It’s okay to take things one step at a time. Self-compassion will be key in this process—acknowledge the effort you’re putting in, and give yourself credit for each positive step forward, no matter how small.
Please remember, what happened to you doesn’t define you. You’re taking the right steps, and it’s okay to ask for help along the way. You’ve already shown incredible resilience by reaching out and sharing your story here.

I totally can relate all your feelings and frustration on this matter.
I lost my entire saving in early of this year. ($50k). I believe we drop into the same group of scammer. It’s also through telegram.
Initially I really felt miserable and stupidity of dropping into the scam. Even now I’m still graving on my money. Praying that they will return me even if is half of it.
But I can assure you that, life move on. We have to swallow the pain and learn to move on. Money, is something that we can always earn it back through hard work and time.
What’s matter most is that we can’t change the past. So instead of leaving in the past, we shall move on and keep going forward. Truly, After this incidence, I learn to be smart and careful, and not to be greedy.
This is a very painful lesson in my life.
Stand up and fight, earn it back x10 of the money !",,3,,,,,

i too, like the prev poster, also lost a large chunk of my savings to a telegram investment scam. significantly less than yours but im still a student with no salary so it hurt just the same.
i understand you don’t want to tell anybody. i also didn’t want to, for fear of being judged, as i also had multiple instances where i could’ve prevented it from getting worse but i kept on going at it thinking i could earn money quickly. i decided to tell 2 of my closest friends because i didn’t know how to handle the situation by myself. i also told my brother about it.
they advised me not to go any further even though i thought it could be legit. they also said the money i lost could be earned back and not to pay anymore in an attempt to get my money back.
i struggled for a while with the loss (this was my second time being scammed ill be honest with you) and it wasn’t easy. but i’ll advice you not to look back too much and to instead look forward, and slowly save up the amount you lost. i know it can be hard, but try to find ways to distract yourself from the loss and be assured that money can be made back. and if you can find the courage to tell just one person about it, your most trusted friend maybe, you may find that you’ll feel a bit better.
we’re all here for you, you got this! hope you heal soon 🫶🏻",,2,,,,,

However, I did decide to reach out to the helpline of SG’s association for mental health and I was able to tell them what happened to me. They were very helpful and it felt good to be able to talk to someone else about it.

Thank you for your reply. I appreciate the detailed steps you’ve provided to me and will try to come up with a more stable plan based on it.
To answer your question on if I have started something, the following are what I have done the past week since the incident:
2. I reached out to SAMNH helpline to talk about what happened. They have been extremely helpful and I am looking to book subsequent sessions with them.
3. I have started setting up a weekly auto-transfer of a fixed amount to my savings account (in addition to my monthly setup) to get a sense of more progress
4. I am more diligent on sticking to my routine of physio exercises and meal prepping to lose weight. These have helped me to put my focus on somewhere else.
5. I have started doing some morning affirmations as a practice of talking to myself in a kinder way.
These are some of what I have already started and I can say that they have been extremely helpful. I’m doing my best to establish these as I don’t want the incident to take more from me especially now that I have to focus on my health.
I have decided to give myself some time before telling my friends and family. In a way, I’m taking this as being kind to myself too by not rushing.
Thank you again for your help. I would like to ask, aside from SAMNH, can you recommend some affordable professional counselling here in Singapore? Cause I’ve been planning for a long time to undergo counselling too.",,0,,23028,23028.0,,

14916,feeling apathetic,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/feeling-apathetic/14916,Seeking Help,---,11048,FuYuan_Affections,Professional,The Wise,23147,2,"Hi @Poller,
Thank you for opening up about what you’re experiencing. It sounds like you’ve been feeling emotionally numb, and that can be a really difficult place to be. It’s like you’re moving through life on autopilot, without much that excites or motivates you. I want to acknowledge how challenging that must be, even if it doesn’t feel traditionally “painful” in the way we often think about emotional distress.
It’s important to recognize that what you’re describing—a loss of interest in things that used to bring you joy, like having a cat or traveling—is a sign that something deeper might be going on. When life feels like it’s just “eat, sleep, work, repeat,” it’s easy to start questioning if there’s any meaning to it at all. It’s understandable that creating meaning feels like too much effort right now, especially when you’re feeling so drained.
One thing I want to stress is that you’re not alone in feeling this way. Many people go through periods where life feels flat and purposeless, and it’s okay to acknowledge that. What’s important is that you’ve taken the first step by expressing how you feel. Sometimes, just putting those feelings into words can start to lift some of the weight.
You mentioned that it feels like a hassle or too much effort to create meaning in your life right now. That’s completely valid. When we’re feeling numb, even small tasks can feel overwhelming. It might help to take things one step at a time, rather than trying to overhaul everything at once. Small, manageable actions—like doing something kind for yourself, reaching out to a friend, or even just going for a walk—can sometimes help spark a bit of that meaning you’re missing, without feeling like a huge effort.
It’s also worth considering whether there’s anything underlying these feelings that might need attention. Sometimes, when we’re emotionally numb, it’s our mind’s way of protecting us from something we’re not quite ready to face. If you feel comfortable, it might be helpful to explore these feelings with someone you trust, whether that’s a friend, a family member, or a counselor.
Remember, it’s okay to take your time with this. You don’t have to have all the answers right now. What’s important is that you’re recognizing these feelings and starting to think about them, which is a significant step in itself.
If you ever feel like you need to talk more or get some extra support, please reach out. You deserve to find meaning and joy in life, even if it feels distant right now. Take care of yourself, Poller, and know that you’re not alone in this.",,0,,,,,

Thank you so much for sharing, I can hear just how overwhelming and stressful this internship has been for you, and it’s really brave of you to reach out and talk about it. Being a perfectionist can make these kinds of situations feel even more intense, and I want you to know that your feelings are completely valid.
It sounds like you’ve been putting an immense amount of pressure on yourself to succeed, and I can understand why the thought of failing or getting terminated feels so scary. When you care so much about doing well, the idea of things not going perfectly can feel like the end of the world. But I want to remind you that perfection isn’t the only way to measure your worth or success. Sometimes, just getting through a tough situation is an achievement in itself.
I know it’s hard when you feel like you’re alone in this and that there’s no one at your workplace to help guide you. It’s okay to feel frustrated or even scared in moments like these. The fact that you’re still showing up and trying your best, even when it feels like it’s not enough, shows incredible strength and resilience.
The perfectionism you’re experiencing is pushing you to believe that anything less than perfect is a failure, but that’s not true. Realistically, no one is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes or faces challenges, especially when they’re doing something new. It’s okay to struggle, and it’s okay to not have all the answers. What’s important is that you’re doing the best you can with the resources you have.
I also want to talk about the mental breakdowns you’ve been having. It’s really tough to feel so overwhelmed that you don’t see a way out. If the pressure is getting to the point where you’re thinking about harming yourself, it’s really important to reach out for help. This might be talking to a trusted adult, a school counselor, or even a mental health professional. They can help you find ways to manage the stress and support you through this tough time.
You mentioned that your teacher said you either have to go on with it or terminate the internship, and I can see how that feels like you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. But remember, no situation is worth sacrificing your mental health. It’s okay to step back and reassess what’s best for you, even if that means making a difficult decision. You are not a failure for needing to take care of yourself.
Finally, I want you to know that it’s okay to not have everything figured out right now. You’re still learning, and that’s exactly what an internship is for—to gain experience, make mistakes, and learn from them. It’s okay to not be perfect, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. You’re not alone in this, and there are people who want to support you, whether that’s a teacher, a counselor, or someone else you trust.
Take things one step at a time, and try to be kind to yourself. You’re doing the best you can, and that’s enough. You matter, and your well-being is important. Take care, and remember that it’s okay to take things day by day. We’re here for you.",,1,,,,,
14918,Is it normal to always find fault with myself?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/is-it-normal-to-always-find-fault-with-myself/14918,Is This Normal?,---,9635,fifteendaffodils,User,,23130,1,"I’m quite an introspective person, and also avoidance is my go-to coping mechanism for any sort of situation. So whenever I develop negative emotions about something that happened or what somebody said, I would start to rationalise their behaviours and find reasons to give them the benefit of doubt. In contrast, I’d also start find fault with my own behaviours and reflect on how I could have handled it better, or proactively mitigate it.
Like I think there’s a healthy threshold at which such introspection and reflection can lead to personal growth. But I also wonder whether the extend to which I have such thoughts is healthy, and how to stop myself before I go over that line. There are times when I consult close friends about a situation and I find myself repeatedly hedging my POV (e.g. “maybe I should have done XYZ”, or “I could said ABC”), and downplaying the severity of the situation by rationalising the other party’s behaviours (e.g. “oh but perhaps they did that because…”, “I understand that they didn’t know…”, “it was partly my fault cos”). And at times these friends have told me that I was being too harsh on myself.
The thing is I think I do know deep down that I’m not at fault, and most of the time I don’t think I am unreasonably critical of myself. I just think that I have very little control about other people’s think, do, and say. So the only way I can make myself feel that I can respond to these negative situations in a positive way is to find ways I can change my own behaviours or improve myself to avoid similar things from happening again.
Is this train of thought normal? Or am I just avoiding confrontation by distracting myself with “things I could do better”?
Honestly, I can feel myself burning out and getting more and more frustrated especially when a tough situation at work isn’t improving. And I feel like coping in the way that I have been coping isn’t helping.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for coming forward so courageously on a topic which I can see is affecting you tremendously. I commend you for having a high level of self awareness. For example you recognise that you have an introspective nature and tendency to rationalize others’ behaviors while being critical of yourself.
These are surprisingly common traits, especially among those who are self-aware and always striving for personal growth. In my opinion, it is a strength, this ability to self evaluate.
However, if overused, this pattern may be leading you to burnout and frustration, which is a signal that it might be time to reassess how you cope with negative emotions and interpersonal conflicts. I believe the following could be useful :
Understanding Your Coping Mechanism
Introspection can be a powerful tool for personal growth, allowing you to reflect on your actions and learn from experiences. However, it can become counterproductive if it leads to excessive self-blame or if you find yourself constantly rationalizing others’ behaviors at the expense of your own feelings.
Avoidance as a Coping Strategy
Avoidance can provide temporary relief from discomfort, but it often prevents you from addressing the underlying issues. By focusing on what you could have done differently, you may be avoiding the confrontation or acknowledgment of how others’ actions impact you.
Recognizing the Signs of Burnout
Burnout can manifest in various ways, including:
Emotional Exhaustion: Feeling drained and unable to cope.
Reduced Performance: Difficulty concentrating or feeling ineffective.
Cynicism: Developing a negative outlook toward work or relationships.
Physical Symptoms: Headaches, fatigue, or changes in sleep patterns.
If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, it’s essential to prioritize self-care and reassess your coping strategies.
Here are some strategies for healthy coping for you to consider adopting:
2. Set Boundaries
Establishing boundaries is crucial for your emotional well-being. This might involve limiting the time you spend with people who drain your energy or learning to say no to additional responsibilities that contribute to your stress.
3. Practice Self-Compassion
Instead of being critical of yourself, practice self-compassion. Acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to feel hurt or frustrated. Remind yourself that your feelings are valid, and it’s important to treat yourself with kindness.
4. Challenge Negative Thoughts
When you find yourself rationalizing others’ behaviors or downplaying your feelings, challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself:
Is this thought helping me?
What evidence do I have that supports or contradicts this thought?
How would I advise a friend in this situation?
5. Focus on What You Can Control
While you cannot control others’ actions, you can control your responses. Identify what aspects of the situation you can influence and focus your energy there. This could involve setting clear expectations at work or communicating your feelings to those involved.
6. Engage in Healthy Outlets
Find constructive ways to express and process your emotions. This could include:
Journaling: Write about your feelings and experiences to gain clarity.
Physical Activity: Engage in exercise or outdoor activities to relieve stress.
Creative Outlets: Explore hobbies like art, music, or writing to channel your emotions.
7. Seek Professional Support
If you find that your coping strategies are leading to burnout and frustration, consider talking to a therapist. A mental health professional can help you explore these patterns, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and provide support as you navigate difficult situations.
Your introspective nature and desire for self-improvement are desirable traits, but it’s good to strike a balance that protects your emotional well-being. By recognizing the signs of burnout and implementing healthier coping strategies, you can create a more positive environment for yourself. Remember, it’s okay to seek help and prioritize your own needs in the process. You deserve to feel supported and understood, both by yourself and by others.",,0,,,,,

I’m sad to hear what you are going through and thank you for bravely seeking assistance to better the situation you are in.
Navigating family dynamics can be deeply challenging, especially as relationships evolve over time. Here are some thoughts and suggestions that might help you gain clarity and find a path forward.
Acknowledge Your Emotions
It’s important to recognize that your feelings are valid. Feeling unloved or mistreated, especially by those who are supposed to care for you, can be deeply painful. Acknowledging these emotions is the first step toward understanding them better.
Reflect on Changes
Consider what specific behaviors or changes you’ve noticed in your parents. Are there particular instances or patterns that stand out? Reflecting on these moments can help you articulate your feelings more clearly when you’re ready to discuss them.
Communicating with Your Parents
When you feel ready, consider having an open and honest conversation with your parents. Find a moment when everyone is calm and not preoccupied with other issues. Use “I” Statements and frame your feelings from your perspective. For example, “I feel hurt when I notice a difference in how we communicate.” Share specific examples of behaviors that have affected you, rather than making general statements. Reinforce that you love them and appreciate their care, but you need to address how you feel.
Also listen to their perspective and allow them to share what they are going through, too. They may not be aware of the impact of their words or actions. Or they may be facing an issue too which you are not aware of. Understanding their perspective can help bridge the gap in communication.
Self-Care and Personal Growth
It’s essential to be kind to yourself during this process. Feeling ungrateful is common, but it’s important to remember that your feelings are legitimate. Practice self-compassion by acknowledging that it’s okay to feel hurt and that you deserve to be treated with love and respect.
Engage in Enjoyable Activities and Hobbies
Find activities that uplift you and help you process your emotions. Whether it’s journaling, exercising, spending time with friends, or pursuing hobbies, these activities can provide a healthy outlet for your feelings.
Seek Support
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a trusted friend or therapist. They can provide a listening ear and help you navigate your emotions and thoughts.
Navigating family relationships can be complex, especially as you transition into adulthood. Remember that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to seek understanding and support. By communicating openly, practicing self-care, and reflecting on your relationships, you can work toward a healthier emotional space. With patience and effort, I believe both yourself and your parents can reach greater understanding and mutual respect.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for courageously seeking help to address this difficult situation. I gather that this friendship is important to you and you are both sad and confused because of what has happened.
On the one hand, you treasure this friendship and want to reestablish it; however on the other hand, there is uncertainty on what you should do and the consequences of your actions to both of you although they are well-meaning. Throughout what you have shared, I see that you have a lot of empathy and understanding for her .
I hope the following helps:
Deepen your understanding of schizoaffective disorder to better understand what she might be experiencing.
Continue your empathetic approach. Reach out to her with kindness and concern, acknowledging her struggles.
Be curious to what she has to say and openly communicate. Focus on your feelings and avoid blaming or accusing language.
Yes, getting a trusted mutual friend, family member, or mental health professional to facilitate the conversation is an option to consider.
Be prepared to accept if she needs space or time to work through her emotions.
Encourage her to continue seeking professional help and offer support in her treatment journey.
Remember, rebuilding trust and your friendship takes time, patience and effort from both parties.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for the courage to reach out for help in your struggles with anxiety. Though what you have shared is surprisingly common, it is never pleasant.
I commend you for being proactive in addressing anxiety. You have been already practising breathing, so well done! As requested, here are a few more tips which I believe will help you tolerate anxiety and eventually not be too affected by it.
a)Start the practice of being more mindful just 3-5 mins at a time. Be curious, observant, more present and aware. Slowly this will build your mindfulness muscle. I believe you will notice more of your surroundings and your internal sensations, thoughts and feelings. it will be good to start mindfulness practice when you are not feeling anxious.
b)The next time you feel anxiety creeping up on you, practise dropping anchor and grounding yourself. With greater mindfulness, you would have developed the ability to detect sensations of anxiety developing in your body. For many of us, anxiety starts off with a sensation of a dry mouth or a tingling sensation. Grounding helps you stay present in the current moment and not get carried away by thoughts. Many people drop anchor by pressing their feet firmly on the ground and feeling the sensations arising as the feet touch the floor.
c)Reflect on what triggers your anxiety. By slowing down and being more aware, you can detect your body sensations when you first start feeling anxious. Know that triggers are just triggers. By slowing down, you can notice and observe the sensations with curiosity . You can then choose not to act on those triggers and this may help.
d)By working with a counsellor you can build up your coping tool box. Learn that thoughts are just thoughts. Observe them without judgement and with curiosity.
e)Ride them out. Let the thoughts chatter in your mind much like a radio in the background. Accept they are there but carry on what you are doing with full attention. Slowly, the negative thoughts will reduce their grip on you.
f)Progressive muscle relaxation is another way to release physical tension as it involves tensing and then releasing various muscle groups in your body.
g)Do urge surfing. Ride out intense urges like the need to go to the washroom frequently without acting on them.
h)Practise self-care exercises regularly to build balance and increase joy in your life.
i)Build your support system of well meaning friends and families.
I hope you can try out some of the above recommendations. I believe with practice, optimism and building the mindfulness muscle, you will be less affected by anxiety. You got this!",,0,,,,,

Thank you for opening up and sharing what’s been on your mind. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now, let’s break down these issues one at a time and see how we can tackle them together.
First, can you tell me more about your financial situation? Are you not getting enough money to buy food at all, or is it that the money you’re making doesn’t allow you to buy decent, nutritious food? If it’s about affording decent food, we can explore budgeting strategies or look for affordable yet nutritious food options. If it’s a matter of not having enough money for food, there might be community resources or assistance programs that can help, have you tried to explore the following portal to explore? https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/
Not eating well can really drain your energy and affect your overall well-being. When your body isn’t getting the nutrients it needs, it’s no wonder you feel lethargic. Try to incorporate simple and inexpensive nutritious options into your diet, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Start with small changes, like adding one nutritious meal or snack a day. If meal planning feels overwhelming, look for easy recipes that require minimal ingredients.
It sounds like your corporate job is taking up a lot of your time, leaving little room for social activities. It’s totally understandable to feel conflicted about wanting to socialize but also feeling drained and worried about the costs involved. Try setting small, manageable goals for social interaction. This could be as simple as having a quick coffee with a colleague or joining a free local event. Reflect on what kind of social interactions you find fulfilling. Sometimes quality is more important than quantity, and finding one or two meaningful connections can make a big difference.
It seems like these issues are all inter-related and affecting your overall quality of life. It’s natural to feel sad and overwhelmed when dealing with multiple stressors. Prolonged stress is unhealthy, so it’s important to address these feelings.
How long have you been feeling this way? Taking the first step to seek help can be daunting, but it’s a crucial part of taking care of your mental health. If you ever feel overwhelmed and need someone to talk to, consider calling a mental health helpline. They can provide immediate support and guidance. Look into community programs that offer financial assistance, food banks, or support groups. Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can provide you with personalized support.
I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to share these concerns. It’s okay to feel sad, anxious, or overwhelmed and it’s important to take one step at a time. These feelings are valid, and acknowledging them is the first step towards finding a solution. Focus on small, manageable changes that can improve your situation. Whether it’s improving your diet, finding a small amount of time to socialize, or addressing work-related stress, every small step counts.
Don’t hesitate to reach out for professional help. There are resources to help you develop coping mechanisms tailored to your situation. Take care, and please keep us updated on how you’re doing. We’re here to support you every step of the way.",https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/ 1 https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing more about what you’re going through. It’s clear that dealing with judgmental comments and negative people is really affecting you, and I can understand why, given your past experiences.
Judgment and Style Criticism: It’s incredibly hurtful when people make judgmental comments, especially about something personal like your sense of style. Remember that your style is a form of self-expression, and it’s unique to you. Their comments don’t define your worth or your abilities.
Dealing with Negative People: It’s true that finding genuinely kind and supportive people can be challenging. However, they do exist. Surrounding yourself with positive influences, even if it’s just a few, can make a significant difference. It’s okay to set boundaries with those who bring negativity into your life.
Past Bullying: The pain from past bullying is something that stays with you, and it’s understandable why certain comments or situations can trigger those feelings. Acknowledging this pain is a crucial step towards healing. You didn’t deserve to be treated that way, and it’s important to remind yourself that those experiences don’t define who you are.
Preference for Solitude: Finding peace in solitude is completely valid, especially if social interactions often lead to discomfort or hurt. Solitude can be a time for self-reflection and growth. However, it’s also important to find a balance that works for you, where you can experience connection without feeling overwhelmed.
Given these points, here are a few suggestions that might help:
2. Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself. Acknowledge that it’s okay to feel hurt by judgmental comments and to need time alone to recharge.
3. Positive Affirmations: Remind yourself of your strengths and what makes you unique. Affirmations can help build your self-esteem and counteract the negativity.
4. Boundaries: It’s okay to distance yourself from people who bring negativity into your life. Surround yourself with those who appreciate you for who you are.
5. Seek Support: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your experiences with bullying and your current struggles. They can offer strategies to help you cope and build resilience.
6. Explore Interests: Engage in activities and hobbies that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. This can also be a way to meet like-minded people.
Remember, finding peace and happiness is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. You deserve to be treated with kindness and respect, both by others and by yourself. If you ever need someone to talk to or more advice, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
Take care, and be gentle with yourself.",,1,,22841,22841.0,,

Thank you for trusting us with your feelings. It’s clear that you’ve been carrying a heavy emotional load, and I want to acknowledge the pain and frustration you’re experiencing. It’s not easy to feel unheard and unsupported, especially after investing so much in your relationship.
Your feelings of exhaustion are completely valid. You’ve been the one initiating the difficult conversations and trying to keep the emotional connection alive for a long time. It’s understandable to feel drained when it seems like those efforts aren’t reciprocated. But the fact that you’ve kept going for 10 years shows incredible resilience and commitment.
It’s important to reflect on what has kept you going in this relationship. What was it that made you continue to invest in it, even when it was hard? Understanding this might help you gain clarity about where you stand now and what you need moving forward.
You mentioned that your husband knows there’s a problem but hasn’t made any real changes. This can be incredibly frustrating. It might be helpful to consider whether he feels stuck or unsure of how to address the issues, even if he’s aware of them. Sometimes, knowing there’s a problem and knowing how to solve it are two very different things.
You also expressed feeling tired of being the initiator. It’s worth exploring whether this pattern has been present throughout your relationship, and how it might have contributed to the current situation. It’s okay to question whether this is something you can continue to do or if it’s time to shift your focus to your own needs and well-being.
It’s natural to feel uncertain about the future of your relationship, especially when you’re not feeling the emotional connection that you need. I encourage you to take the time to reflect on what this relationship means to you now. Has the meaning changed, or do you feel it’s been lost? This might help you decide whether there’s still something worth fighting for or if it’s time to consider other options.
Remember, you don’t have to have all the answers right now. It’s okay to take things one step at a time and to prioritize your own emotional health. Whether you decide to seek more support, have more conversations, or take a break, what matters most is that you’re taking care of yourself.
Please continue to share your thoughts if you feel comfortable. We’re here to support you, and you don’t have to go through this alone.

i think im quite an anxious and overly ‘nice’ person, and feel like i always overthink things and am very critical of myself. in my head, i feel like it’s hard to support myself during difficult moments such as studying for my upcoming test, because there are more things to hate than love. i always approach my parents about my anxieties but i feel like i bombard them with too much that it’s probably better that i stop for a bit and give them a break, although i do second guess that too…
i feel that academically, i’m behind compared to many, or all of my friends. i find trouble in completing all my homework on time, and although reflecting back, i don’t feel too worried about a few subjects like Science and Maths, there are also a few other subjects I’m pretty worried about because i know I haven’t done enough yet. i also feel that as an above-average student usually for the past few years, i should be doing above-average / pretty well in these tests, but im worried that that won’t be the case.
my anxieties are also probably due to the fact that i have really high expectations of myself, but without expectations i feel i won’t achieve anything.
i also feel anxious about my relationships with others. i get worried about whether im being a good enough friend for others, or am being a good listener. something funny; i like searching online about how to be a better friend / listener / whether being anxious is okay / other questions i have and write them down in my Notion, because i believe that it can be beneficial to know, but now thinking back, maybe it’s not very good for me and is instead being redirected into negativity
but idk, i know im probably being delusional and overly drama, but i can’t stop being anxious about this? how do i stop being so anxious, or what should i do? sorry this might be a lot for people, just feel like putting it out there cause am quite overwhelmed and want to find out what i can try to do next time in the future",,1,,,,,

I can see that you have been feeling anxious in the recent days. Just wanted to say, it’s okay to feel anxious sometimes as long as we know how to cope with it properly. to be frank, I feel equally anxious at the current point in time for the same thing as u, my studies.
Well I’m in a phase of uncertainty where, I don’t really know how things are gonna turn out with regards to my study path. However, I try to cope with this uncertainty by trying to take action in areas which can possibly be changed for the better. In my case - I do so by trying to prepare before hand for lessons.
Apparently, I read from a book - 'The twenty something treatment"" by Meg Jay, that, there is this part of the brain called the amygdala which kinds of anticipates the not so plausible case scenarios, and helps to prepare one to tackle them. When this part of this brain gets active, we tend to worry and anticipate the negative case studies more. To the Resident Therapists, please correct me if I’m wrong!
Combat this, we have to get mindful. The author who is a psychologist recommends us to do a simple activity. take a second to pause and as calmly as possible, write down the things u can see, hear, touch, and smell on a piece of paper at that point of time.
I have done this and it works in reducing my anxiety!
You can try this activity too, and see how it goes! Cheers!

Before I continue I would like to give a quick shout out to lovelychange for sharing about the book, your experiences and how you have personally benefited from the mindfulness exercise
May I also suggest the following for you to consider:
2. Self-compassion: Practice kindness and understanding towards yourself. Acknowledge your efforts and accomplishments. You don’t have to compete with anyone. Run your own race. Improve daily.
3. Realistic expectations: Set achievable goals and recognize that it’s normal and ok to make mistakes.
4. Time management: Break tasks into smaller chunks, prioritize, and focus on one task at a time.
5. Seek support: Continue talking to your parents, but also consider speaking with a school counsellor for additional guidance.
6. Reflect on online research: Limit your searching to specific topics and set a timer to avoid excessive reading. Focus on constructive advice.
7. Friendships: Communicate openly with friends, ask for feedback, and focus on nurturing meaningful relationships.
8. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Explore stress-reducing activities like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.
9. Celebrate small wins: Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.
10. Challenge negative thoughts: When anxious thoughts arise, try to reframe them in a more positive and realistic light.
11. Take breaks and practice self-care: Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax.

14858,Am I giving too much?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/am-i-giving-too-much/14858,Is This Normal?,---,12160,Potatoed,User,,23022,1,"Hi, I am in a predicament situation.
I had broken up with my partner but we decided to go back to “dating” phase without any commitments. There were various reasons, but the main reason was that I was too clingy.
I was hurt and upset about it but decided to try it out again because I really love them so much.
At first, it started out shaky because knowing that we’re no longer committed to one another, I can’t go to them for everything. I had to learn how to be independent again. I had give them more space. I had to find other personal hobbies to distract myself. I had to seek counselling to better myself. Set boundaries. I’m doing everything to make them feel comfortable being with me again. But it felt like they had forgotten that I have feelings.
As days passes by, the calls and messages between us decreases. We barely meet anymore. All because they need space, they’re tired from their daily life. I understand that and didn’t bother them as much. I continued giving them space. I will only reply their messages or meet up with them if they messaged me first or asked for a meet-up. I would not initiate it because as mentioned, they wanted space.
But today, all I asked for is one call and all they said was “See how. I’ll let you know later.” It was so cold. And they proceeded to ignore me for hours.
With that reply, I felt nothing like a person they’re dating. I felt like someone less than a friend. I felt like I’m no longer their priority. I felt my feelings were being taken for granted.

Thank you for reaching out for help in this difficult situation. It takes a lot of courage to pour your heart out and I am sad to hear how hurt you are feeling. Your feelings are 100% valid, real and understandable.
I can see you have been investing a lot into this situationship, but your experience so far suggests the other party has not been mutually reciprocal and appreciative of you.
May I encourage you to:
a)seek help from a counsellor to fully process and identify what you want and need in your relationships.
b)show yourself self-compassion and kindness. Be fully honest to yourself, reflect deeply on what you deserve and consider whether your love for them is overshadowing your own self-worth and happiness. Remember your self-worth is in your own hands.
c)If possible, set up a meeting with them to communicate how you have been feeling about their recent behaviour. Work out and agree on certain boundaries that both sides can use as guidelines.
d)Widen your circle of friendships and get to know more people. Observe healthy relationships around you that are nurturing, respectful and mutually beneficial.
Friendships of all types require mutual respect, communication and honesty. You fully fully deserve that, nothing less. Please take good care of yourself at all times.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for your bravery in reaching out for assistance. I’m sad to see how conflicted, worried and sad you are feeling. I think these overwhelming feelings are fully valid and 100% understandable. This is indeed such a difficult decision to make. Please do not feel helpless and alone, we are here to journey with you.
Let’s take a look at your choices:
Choice A: To accept the Singapore citizenship.
Choice B: To not accept the Singapore citizenship.
I recommend that you can write down the pros and cons of each choice. Be honest with yourself on what your worries are for each of the two choices.
Speaking to a counsellor may help to gain clarity, too. Through the counsellor’s non judgmental attitude, I believe you can experience safety, fully process your emotions and be heard.
In the counselling sessions, you are also able to pinpoint and articulate your values, needs, fears and challenges. It is possible that new perspectives could emerge which you may not have realised earlier. With these new insights and clarity, you are likely to make a more informed decision. If possible you may be able to identify potential workarounds that could be more acceptable and reduce the struggle.
This decision has understandably heightened anxiety for you to such an extent that your well-being, health and daily life activities like eating has been negatively affected. This self-neglect is understandable and common considering your current circumstances. However it is taking a toll on you. Do explore other healthier ways of coping. For example, Please start taking small steps to regain your health and well-being, have regular healthy meals and participate in enjoyable activities to reignite joy in your life.
Please take good care of yourself and I believe with clarity, you can make a good decision.",,0,,,,,

I’ll explain things in chronological order till whatever I’m going through now
I’m a uni student, Y2 this upcoming sem but since Y1S2, I lack the motivation to study like I want to, but when it comes to watching lectures, my brain just could not sit still and focus. Random thoughts will just come in my head and I just gotta do something else. I changed environment and got a study buddy but it remains. I ended up failing two modules.
Moving on to sem break. It was a 3 months sem break and I did not leave home for more than 14 days in total. I couldn’t bring myself up to even go out to buy food. My hobby was reading novel and I could focus on a novel for a long time before. Now I couldn’t even go through one page before my mind starts wandering.
I kept telling myself I will go out more and when the time comes, I dread going out. Just stepping out of the house feels tiring to me.
Being at house all days means I didn’t talk to anyone. I severely lack social interactions but I couldn’t even bring myself to reply to my friends because it drains my social battery.
Nothing seems interesting anymore and I just feel nothing all day. No happiness, no sadness, just nothing. I go through my day numb and I just couldn’t bring myself out of it.
I also recently started watching my weight so with the restriction although mild, it took out my joy of enjoying food. It wasn’t too bad for now, but I definitely feel the effect creeping on me.
I just want to change and do well in school again but I couldn’t bring myself out of this chaotic but numb headspace. What is wrong with me and how can I change?",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what’s been going on with you. I can tell that you’re going through a really difficult time, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to open up about these struggles.
It sounds like you’re feeling stuck in a place where nothing seems to bring joy or motivation, and that’s got to be incredibly frustrating and disheartening. You’ve mentioned how hard it’s been to focus on your studies, even with the efforts you’ve made, like changing your environment and getting a study buddy. Failing two modules must have added to the weight you’re already carrying, making it even harder to find the drive to keep going.
The fact that you spent most of your break at home, with little social interaction, seems to have created a cycle where even the thought of going out feels exhausting. I can imagine how isolating that must be, especially when you’re craving connection but find it so draining at the same time. Feeling numb and disconnected, like nothing brings you happiness or sadness anymore, is really tough, especially when you just want to feel something different but don’t know how.
It also sounds like things that used to bring you joy, like reading novels, aren’t giving you that comfort anymore. Watching your weight and losing the joy in food adds another layer of stress and makes everything feel more difficult.
From what you’ve shared, it seems like you might be dealing with burnout or even depression. It’s not uncommon for people in situations like yours to feel the way you’re feeling, and I want to emphasize that none of this is your fault. It’s something that’s happening to you, and it’s okay to seek help to get through it.
Here are a few thoughts:
- Start small. You don’t have to change everything all at once. Maybe try setting a small goal each day, like getting some fresh air or reading a few pages of a book. Small steps can help you gain a bit of momentum.
- Reconnect with what used to bring you joy. I know it might feel hard right now, but maybe there’s an activity, even something simple, that could help spark a little interest or joy again.
- Don’t be afraid to talk to someone. Whether it’s a counselor, a therapist, or even a trusted friend, having someone to talk to can make a big difference. You don’t have to go through this alone.
- Be gentle with yourself. It’s really important to practice self-compassion during times like this. You’re dealing with a lot, and it’s okay to give yourself some grace.
You’re going through a tough time, but you don’t have to navigate it alone. Reaching out here is a great first step, and I hope you’ll keep sharing what’s on your mind. We’re here to listen and support you through this.
Take care, and know that you’re not alone.",,1,,,,,

I think your friend just needed a listening ear. Maybe you can prompt more questions like what are some of the complex things that made him being goofy. At the same time you can comfort him by saying that, thank you for trying his best to make people’s day however, maybe being the goofy personality himself he actually hurt someone else without knowing.

Thank you for reaching out. It’s wonderful to see how much you care about your friend and are actively seeking ways to support them. Your friend is lucky to have someone as thoughtful and compassionate as you. It’s truly admirable that you’re taking the time to understand how to help them better. Well done!
When your friend opens up like that, listening and being supportive is important. Here are some suggestions for your consideration:
2. Acknowledge Their Feelings: Let them know you appreciate them sharing with you.
Example: “Thanks for telling me. It sounds like there’s a lot on your mind.”
3. Example: “Thanks for telling me. It sounds like there’s a lot on your mind.”
4. Show Understanding: Recognise that their behaviour might be hiding deeper feelings.
Example: “Being the funny and goofy one can sometimes be a way to cope with deeper feelings.”
5. Example: “Being the funny and goofy one can sometimes be a way to cope with deeper feelings.”
6. Offer Support: Let them know they don’t have to handle it alone and that you’re there for them.
Example: “It’s okay to feel uncomfortable when others are upset. You don’t have to deal with it alone. If you ever want to talk more about what’s bothering you or how you’re feeling, I’m here for you.”
7. Example: “It’s okay to feel uncomfortable when others are upset. You don’t have to deal with it alone. If you ever want to talk more about what’s bothering you or how you’re feeling, I’m here for you.”
8. Communicate Empathy: Use active listening and show you care about their feelings.
Example: “I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. It must be tough. I’m here for you.”
9. Example: “I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. It must be tough. I’m here for you.”
10. Suggest a Chat: Propose hanging out or continuing the conversation later.
Example: “Let’s hang out soon and chat, or just text me anytime you need to talk.”
11. Example: “Let’s hang out soon and chat, or just text me anytime you need to talk.”
- Example: “Thanks for telling me. It sounds like there’s a lot on your mind.”
- Example: “Being the funny and goofy one can sometimes be a way to cope with deeper feelings.”
- Example: “It’s okay to feel uncomfortable when others are upset. You don’t have to deal with it alone. If you ever want to talk more about what’s bothering you or how you’re feeling, I’m here for you.”
- Example: “I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. It must be tough. I’m here for you.”
- Example: “Let’s hang out soon and chat, or just text me anytime you need to talk.”
It is also important for you to recognise the limits of what you can do as a friend.
Sometimes, our friends’ problems can be really deep, and it’s okay if you don’t know how to help. Peer support is great, but it has its limits. They’re not professionals, and that’s okay too. If things feel too big to handle, suggest talking to a counsellor where appropriate.
Sometimes, the most powerful thing a friend can do is simply listen and provide a safe space for others to share. We don’t always need to solve problems; sometimes, just being there and journeying alongside our friends is enough.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Mano Esperanza here.
I just keep it as concise as possible.
1st situation. It was clear that we are just friends that care for each other after about 12 years of friendship. Used to like her more than that but she is a single mom and her kids dont want a father figure. Guess its just what it is. People around us think that we are an item and i even jokingly proposed the idea and once seriously but i guess its not meant to be. I dont know if its also because of the stigma surrounding mental illness.
2nd. Online relationship with a gal in Brazil that was confusing cause one moment she said we were a couple and the next moment i see her photos with another guy. Happened 2 times in the past 12 years. Most likely wont work out so we are just friends.
I guess i just got bad luck with love and its okay, It is what it is.
3rd and final one was with a local girl that i met thru facebook and we were going to get married about 10 years back. Her family didnt like the idea that i have mental illness so they asked for a 20k dowry.
Im not sure about the rest that have mental health issues but in Singapore its like the ultimate curse. Worse than those who have commited crimes whom yet get a 2nd chance in society but when it comes to mental illness we arent even given a chance in Employment, Love, Social Acceptance many other thing in Sunny Singapore.
The Former President Madam Halimah Yacob did try to address and advocate this but i think we as a society have a long way to go with our conservative ways.

It takes a lot of courage to open up about these deep-seated concerns, and I hope that you feel better in sharing your thoughts and fears with us. It sounds like you’re going through a lot right now, and it’s understandable to feel scared and unsure about change.
The idea of being stuck in a mental loop can be daunting, especially when change feels like it might strip away your identity. It’s normal to be scared of change, but it’s important to remember that change doesn’t mean losing who you are. It means growing and evolving, and sometimes, it’s the key to finding new aspects of yourself that you might really appreciate.
Your fear of not being able to relate to people with mental issues if you heal is very valid. Many people worry that healing might distance them from their current support systems or make them less empathetic. However, healing doesn’t mean you lose your empathy or your ability to understand others. In fact, it can make you an even better listener and supporter because you’ve experienced the journey of recovery and can share that perspective.
It’s also understandable to feel comfort in revisiting past incidents, even if they were traumatic. This can be a way of trying to make sense of what happened and finding a sense of safety in the familiar. However, it’s important to find a balance and not let these past events keep you stuck in a cycle that prevents you from moving forward.
Your hobbies and the things you enjoy don’t have to disappear if you start to feel better. Often, as we heal, we find new ways to engage with our interests and even discover new passions. Healing can open up more opportunities for joy and fulfillment.
It’s important to remember that you are not overreacting, and seeking help through counselling is a positive step toward taking care of your mental health. Progressing with life normally is a good goal, but it’s okay to need support along the way. You didn’t choose to become like this, and it’s not your fault. Mental health struggles are complex and can be influenced by many factors.
Here are a few things to consider:
Embrace the Journey: Healing is a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. You don’t have to rush or force yourself to change all at once.
Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself. Recognize that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to be scared. Change can be difficult, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.
Remember, you are not alone in this journey. Many people have faced similar fears and found ways to heal while still maintaining their empathy and connection to others. You have the strength and resilience to navigate this and progress w life normally. What you choose, you have to believe that you are doing your best to cope, so it is not about being your only fault. Hope that it helps.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your reflections. It sounds like you’re going through a tough time, and it’s really good that you’re looking for support. The feelings you’re experiencing — lack of excitement, withdrawal from people, and a disrupted routine — can be overwhelming and confusing. It’s important to remember that experiencing these kinds of feelings doesn’t make you weak or inadequate. Sometimes, our minds and bodies react to stress, changes, or even burnout in ways that can make us feel disconnected and unmotivated.
Would you be willing to share more about what led you to these realizations? Was there a specific event or thought that triggered these reflections? Understanding the root cause can be helpful in addressing these feelings as helpfully identified by @OMT
While it’s challenging, taking small steps towards self-care can make a significant difference. Here are a few things that might help:
2. Try to slowly reintroduce activities that used to bring you joy. Start small, maybe a short walk or a brief chat with a friend.
3. A counselor or therapist can help you explore these feelings more deeply and develop strategies to cope. Sometimes having someone to talk to who is trained to help can provide new insights and relief.
4. Practice being kind to yourself. Journaling can help you stay present and process your emotions without judgment.
5. Even though your exercise routine is in shambles, try to find ways to incorporate some form of physical activity. Movement can significantly impact your mood and energy levels.
6. It’s okay to lean on the people who care about you. They might not have all the answers, but their support can make a big difference.
Remember, you don’t have to go through this alone. There are resources and people willing to help. Sometimes just taking the first step to talk about what you’re feeling can start the process of healing. Take care, and we’re here for you.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. It’s incredibly brave of you to open up about what you’re experiencing. I can see that you’re dealing with a lot, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to feel like you’re mentally draining others or forcing them to listen.
It sounds like you have a strong need for validation, which is completely natural. We all need to feel heard and understood, especially when we’re dealing with our problems. It’s hard when you feel like opening up might frustrate others or that they don’t really care, even if they say they do.
Needing to talk about your problems as a way to calm yourself down is a valid coping mechanism. Sometimes, just voicing our concerns can help us process and understand them better. However, it sounds like you’re worried about burdening others, which can make it difficult to reach out for support.
I can see that you’re a thoughtful person, and that keen awareness sometimes makes it even harder to deal with the need for self-validation. Finding a balance between seeking support from others and validating yourself can be really helpful. Here are a few things you might consider:
Think about who in your life is genuinely supportive and willing to listen. It might be a close friend, a family member, or even a support group. These are the people who can provide the validation you need without feeling drained.
It’s okay to ask for help, but it can also be helpful to set boundaries for yourself and others. You might start a conversation by asking if it’s a good time to talk and being mindful of how often you reach out to the same person.
Developing self-validation techniques can be empowering. Journaling, mindfulness, and self-compassion exercises can help you process your emotions without always needing external validation. Remind yourself that your feelings are valid and it’s okay to feel what you’re feeling.
Consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They are trained to provide the kind of support and validation you need and can help you develop strategies to cope with your feelings. They can offer a safe space to explore your emotions without fear of judgment or frustration.
Create a validation toolkit. Collect affirmations, quotes, and messages that resonate with you and make you feel understood. When you’re feeling overwhelmed, refer to this toolkit to remind yourself that your feelings are important and valid.
Remember, asking for help doesn’t make you a burden. It’s a sign of strength and self-awareness. The people who care about you want to support you, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. Sometimes, they might not know how to show it, or they might have their own limitations, but that doesn’t diminish your need for validation and support.
You deserve to feel heard and supported, and there are ways to find that balance. Keep reaching out and exploring different ways to meet your needs. We’re here for you, and your feelings matter.
Take care, Rachelle, and keep believing in your worth and the importance of your feelings. Let us know how you feel?",,0,,,,,

Thank you for opening up and sharing your experiences. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a heavy burden for a long time, and it’s completely understandable to feel the way you do. The fear and anxiety you feel from your childhood experiences with your mother are very real and valid.
Your fear and anxiety aren’t just in your head. Those childhood experiences with severe punishment and strictness have left a deep impact. Feeling scared and anxious when you hear your mother’s footsteps or when she raises her voice is a natural response to those past traumas.
It makes sense that these experiences are affecting your current relationships. When we’ve been conditioned to expect fear and punishment from those close to us, it’s natural to feel anxious and blame ourselves when similar situations arise with others, even if they’re not exactly the same. This isn’t an overreaction; it’s a sign that your past traumas are still affecting your present.
It might be very beneficial for you to seek professional help to work through these past traumas. Therapy, especially trauma-focused therapy can help you process these experiences and reduce their impact on your current life. Here is an option for you to consider; SAMH (Singapore Association for Mental Health) at 1800-283-7019
Sharing your feelings with trusted friends, family, or a support group can also provide a sense of relief and understanding. Sometimes, just knowing that others care and understand can make a big difference.
It’s crucial to be kind and patient with yourself as you navigate these feelings. Healing from trauma is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Your reactions are not a sign of weakness or overreaction; they’re a testament to the strength you’ve shown in surviving and coping with your past.
Consider reaching out to a therapist who specializes in trauma. Writing about your feelings can sometimes help process them. Practices like deep breathing can help manage anxiety in the moment.
Your experiences and feelings are valid, and you deserve to find peace and healing. Take good care and please keep reaching out for support.",SAMH https://www.samhealth.org.sg/our-services/outreach/samh-insight-centre/#1545895446184-0c71e7f9-ecc9,0,,,,,

It was a devastating shock. There were no signs of illness, no warnings. One moment she was alive and well, the next she was gone. She collapsed on Dad’s shoulder and never regained consciousness. She never wakes up again, no matter how much I call her.
From the moment the medical team arrived, through the ambulance ride to the hospital, I clung to hope. I believed she would wake up. But when the doctor came out and told us they couldn’t revive her, my world shattered. It felt so unreal. We had just enjoyed a wonderful vacation and were heading home. She was even planning our next trip
The loss is still overwhelming. I miss our daily phone calls after work and our shared dinners. I’ve always been close to both my parents, especially Mum. Even after getting married, I made a point to visit them every weekend.
My dad and Mum were inseparable. Both retired, they enjoyed a quiet, domestic life. I’m concerned about Dad, as he’s not one to express his feelings. He appears strong, but I know he’s struggling. They were always together, whether running errands, dining out, or simply relaxing at home. Now, Dad faces a stark loneliness. He does not has a social life. He only does some temp jobs on some days if the kitchen needs additional help.
I’m determined to spend as much time with Dad as possible. Balancing a full-time job, part-time studies, and caring for him is challenging. I feel guilty for not being able to give him my full attention. The constant travel between our homes is exhausting.
I’ve considered moving back to live with Dad, but I hesitated because of my husband’s unhappiness with me being constantly away. Our recent argument provided an opportunity to reassess the situation. I can work from home some days, which allows me to spend more time with Dad.
Honestly, I feel more at peace in my childhood home. My marriage has become increasingly difficult. We’ve been married for fifteen years, but unresolved issues from the past have created distance. My husband’s constant pressure to return home is stressful. I feel torn between caring for Dad and maintaining our relationship. His insistence on Dad’s independence is frustrating, especially given the circumstances.
Mum’s sudden death has left me consumed by fear and anxiety for Dad. I yearn to be with him constantly, to protect him. The thought of losing him is unbearable. I find myself wishing for a different life, free from the complexities of my marriage.
Between money problems, a new job that’s not going great, and all the drama with my husband, I’m at my wits end. I don’t know how to handle it all. I’m really exhausted.",,2,,,,,

I’m deeply sorry for your loss. It’s clear from your words how much you loved your mother and how close you were to both your parents. Losing someone so suddenly is a profound shock, and it’s natural to feel overwhelmed and devastated.
Your determination to care for your father is admirable, especially given the circumstances. It’s understandable that you’re worried about him and feel the need to protect him. However, it’s important to acknowledge the toll this is taking on you, both physically and emotionally.
The sudden loss of your mother has left a void that feels impossible to fill. The worry and fear you have for your father’s safety adds a layer of struggle for you to cope with. Your marriage is feeling the strain as you juggle multiple responsibilities and emotions. The unresolved issues with your husband add another layer of stress. Balancing work, studies, and caring for your father is exhausting. The constant travel and emotional burden are understandably overwhelming.
The suddenness of your mother’s death increases your fear of losing your father. This fear is driving your need to be constantly present with him. The tension with your husband stems from both the unresolved past issues and the current situation. His insistence on your father’s independence conflicts with your protective instincts. While you’re taking on so much, it’s essential to recognize that seeking help and support is not a sign of weakness but a necessary step to manage this challenging time.
Have an honest conversation with your husband about your fears and the importance of supporting your father right now. Express your need for his understanding and support. Consider seeking professional counseling or therapy. A therapist can help you navigate your grief, fear, and marital issues, providing strategies to manage your emotions and responsibilities. Try to establish a routine that includes self-care activities. Whether it’s a walk, cooking with your father, or any small activity you both enjoy, it can help provide a sense of normalcy and relief. If possible, discuss temporary arrangements that allow you to spend more time with your father without straining your marriage. Working from home some days is a good start.
Don’t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or support groups who can offer practical help and emotional support. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember that there are resources available. For instance,
2. SAMH 1800-283-7019
3. Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) provides a 24-hour hotline (1800-221-4444) for anyone in crisis.
They can offer support and guidance during difficult times.
Remember, it’s okay to take one step at a time. You’re doing an incredible job managing so much, and it’s important to give yourself grace during this challenging period. We’re here for you, and you’re not alone in this.

Thank you for reaching out courageously. Please be assured that it is fully understandable to feel anxious as exams are next Monday. Your concerns raised, too are 100% valid. Stay optimistic and focused as there is time before next Monday to catch up with some planning and time management.
I have worked with many students who have shared similar experiences so please don’t feel alone. With determination, and by adopting some of these strategies they used which worked for them, I believe you can manage your anxiety and make the most of your study time:
2. Break down your study material: Divide the 800 pages into smaller chunks, creating a schedule with achievable daily goals. Focus on one topic at a time.
3. Prioritize: Identify the most critical topics and allocate more time for those.
4. Use active learning techniques: Summarize key points in your own words, create concept maps, or make flashcards to help retain information.
5. Time management: Allocate dedicated study sessions, eliminating distractions during that time. Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused study + 5 minutes of break).
6. Family plan adjustment: Communicate your concerns with your family, explaining your exam situation. They may be understanding and support your need for study time. Negotiate, where possible, such that you can still enjoy some family time but able to fit in studies as well.
7. Self-care: Don’t neglect rest and relaxation. Use your breaks for activities that bring you joy and calmness.
8. Anxiety management: In addition to breathing exercises, try:
Progressive muscle relaxation
Mindfulness meditation (even 5-10 minutes a day)
Physical activity (short walks or yoga)
Positive self-talk and affirmations
9. Progressive muscle relaxation
10. Mindfulness meditation (even 5-10 minutes a day)
11. Physical activity (short walks or yoga)
12. Positive self-talk and affirmations
13. Seek support: Share your concerns with friends or classmates, and ask for help if needed.
14. Reframe regrets: Instead of dwelling on past procrastination, focus on what you can control now. Celebrate small victories, like completing a study session.
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Mindfulness meditation (even 5-10 minutes a day)
- Physical activity (short walks or yoga)
- Positive self-talk and affirmations
Remember, you’ve got this! Stay focused and optimistic. Good luck on your exam!",,0,,,,,

Thank you for courageously seeking help and I am sorry to hear how much you have been struggling.
I believe that you are facing individuals who may be intentionally trying to elicit and provoke a reaction from you. When you shared how you inadvertently get drawn into these conversations and later realise when it is too late that it could have been avoided, I sense you are hurting very much. I hope it helps you feel better when I share what you did previously is a very human and normal response. I also want to assure you that with greater awareness and proactive strategies listed here, you can overcome getting drawn into these potential minefields:
Recognize the Pattern: The first step is to become fully aware of the pattern. Notice when these interactions typically start, who initiates them, and what the usual topics are. Awareness can help you catch yourself before you respond.
Pause Before Responding: When you feel the urge to respond, take a deep breath and count to ten. This pause gives you a moment to consider whether engaging is worth it and what the possible consequences might be. Do something else first, or even sleep on it. Choose your response.
Set Boundaries: Clearly define your boundaries with these individuals. You can politely but firmly state that you don’t wish to discuss certain topics or engage in certain conversations.
Use “I” Statements: If you need to respond, use “I” statements to express your feelings without blaming others. For example, “I feel uncomfortable discussing this topic and prefer not to continue.”
Walk Away: If the conversation becomes too much, it’s okay to physically remove yourself from the situation. Excuse yourself and walk away if necessary.
Limit Exposure: Reduce the amount of time you spend around these individuals. If you can, avoid situations where you know these interactions are likely to occur.
Practice Self-Reminders: Create a mantra or reminder for yourself. It could be something like, “I choose peace over conflict” or “Not every comment needs a response.” Write it down and keep it somewhere visible, like on your phone or a sticky note.
Seek Support: Talk to a trusted friend or a counsellor about these interactions. They can offer perspective and advice, and sometimes just talking about it can help reinforce your resolve. A counsellor can further help you develop strategies to manage these interactions, set boundaries and work on any underlying issues that make you susceptible to them.
Supportive Friends or Family: Share your experiences with friends or family who understand your situation. They can offer advice, support, and encouragement.
Remember, it’s okay to protect your peace and prioritize your well-being. You don’t have to engage in every conversation, especially if it’s detrimental to your mental health.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out courageously for help. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now and its understandable, valid and normal to experience feeling overwhelmed and demotivated.
Take a deep breath, ground your feet onto the ground and stay in the present. Do this deep breathing and grounding for about three minutes to self-regulate your emotions and bring the thinking brain back online.
Now I encourage you write out the tasks you need to do.
Secondly, prioritise them into three categories - for example, indicate which tasks are urgent (due today), not immediately urgent (due this week) and due in the next two weeks/or later.
Next, for each task, further break them down into smaller manageable chunks. Write these sub tasks down. Doing this could make the task less scary and more achievable.
Set tiny goals for each task which you are more likely to achieve. This could generate a sense of achievement and works towards gaining momentum.
I recommend you can use the Pomodoro method where you set a timer to about 10 minutes. During this 10 minutes, there will be no interruptions. Once you conquer the first 10 minutes, take a 1 min break and continue with another 10 minutes. Slowly increase to blocks of 25 minutes of uninterrupted work, followed by a 5 min break and them continue again. With practice, you can overcome the initial inertia and establish a flow.
It is great to hear that there are people in your life who would willingly lend you a helping hand and a listening ear if you approach them. Start tiny conversations with the most trusted helpful and non judgmental among them. Reaching out for support could open up more avenues of assistance. I believe you will also realise you are not alone; so tapping on others’ support is an excellent option.
Do practise self compassion as you slowly work on getting things done. If you fall off the wagon, that is OK, take steps to start again instead of paying attention to any negative self-talk. Let the negative self-talk chatter in the background, focus instead on the steps you need to do. Slowly, the negative self-talk will reduce its grip on you and fade away.
Celebrate small wins. Cross out that to do list for the tasks/subtasks you have completed. It can be a good morale-booster.
If possible, identify through self reflection the reasons behind the drop in motivation. Addressing them could help you regain your drive and enthusiasm.
Please do not be too disheartened by this. Taking small steps to start off is the key to overcoming the current dip you are experiencing. You got this!",,0,,,,,

It’s weird, I know. To like someone only because you think they would be a good father towards you.

I could go on rants, and stupid delusions about what I would want a fictional character to do with me. And all of it is just affection. Not going to go into the details of that or anything, a little bit too insane to rant on.

Thank you for your courage to share your feelings. I commend your honesty and openness. Firstly please be assured that the feelings you have described are fully understandable and I believe fairly common.
It’s normal to seek affection and comfort, especially if you feel like you didn’t receive enough in your childhood. Fictional characters can represent idealized versions of what we desire in relationships, including fatherly affection.
What you described is a “parasocial relationship.” It’s a one-sided emotional connection with a fictional character or celebrity, often driven by a desire for comfort, guidance, or affection.
Your analysis of characters and seeing yourself in them is also normal. It’s called “identification,” where we connect with characters who share similar traits, emotions, or experiences.
Remember, it’s okay to have these feelings! They might stem from unmet emotional needs, but acknowledging and understanding them can help you address those needs in healthier ways. Speaking to a therapist may be a safe way to explore these feelings further or discuss ways to cultivate affectionate relationships in your life.

ever since young i’ve always been left out everywhere, even in kindergarten friend groups, i would be the last person people would look to for company & i naturally never thought anything about it when i was a child
in primary school and secondary school, i’ve had adhoc friends & friend groups, somehow or another always having friendships or relationships ending up in losing contact or falling out. some of these relationships were super close so when i lost them it constantly felt like my world was ending and it got worse & worse over the years when i kept getting my hopes up for a friendship that would last (since i did feel really happy with when i was with them) only for it to fail again. went to a school counsellor but they just kept telling me how it would get better and how friends come and go, which i agreed with but just made me feel even more hopeless as i tried to improve and put my best into fuelling friendships and becoming a better person everyday only to fail again. at some point in time i began to isolate myself a lot in secondary school since a lot of my classmates were quite toxic, which made my personality go from outgoing & charismatic to quiet & reserved. over the years i’ve forgotten how to converse well with others no matter how much i try to do so, or put my effort into it.
at the moment currently in junior college fresh out of a breakup with someone who, prior to our relationship, was my best friend. it took quite a big toll on me since i loved them a lot and it hurt a lot when they didn’t love me. i also didn’t have any other close friends. i took a subject combination with a lot of science subjects that i thought initially were okay but i’m gradually burning out more from day to day. i also used to like writing a lot but recently have been in the biggest rut in terms of writing and feeling myself losing interest in writing as well. all these have culminated to me thinking about dropping out of jc, yet not wanting to disappoint anyone + not being certain if going to poly is any better than this, or whether it can earn me a stable future, so i’ve just been stuck in this forever cycle of dread and overworking myself nonstop. yet i haven’t been doing well in academics or cca, or anything else either.
because of all these events happening, i’ve started to feel really hopeless about my life but i don’t really have anyone to turn to since i don’t want to trouble my family with this. i would really like some advice on how to feel more hopeful for day to day life and how to converse and communicate better with others since recently i haven’t been able to, leading to me being left out quite a lot in daily contexts.
thank you so much",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your experiences. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a heavy burden for a long time, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and hopeless given everything you’ve been through.
You’ve shown incredible resilience by continuing to push forward despite feeling isolated and unsupported. It’s clear that you care deeply about your relationships and your future, which shows your strength and determination.
From what you’ve shared, it seems like loneliness has been a recurring theme in your life. Let’s take a moment to acknowledge the brave choices you’ve made, like distancing yourself from toxic friendships, even though it led to temporary loneliness. That decision reflects your strength and your ability to prioritize your well-being.
It’s also crucial to understand that the duration of your friendships does not determine your self-worth. You’ve shown qualities of resilience, self-awareness, and courage that are incredibly valuable. Can you recall specific moments when you felt proud of yourself for reasons unrelated to your social relationships? Reflecting on these moments can help you see your worth beyond friendships.
The recent breakup and academic pressures are understandably taking a toll on you. It’s okay to feel burned out and to struggle with maintaining interest in activities you once enjoyed. Sometimes, reconnecting with past interests or finding new ones can reignite your motivation.
You’re at a stage in life where relationships and emotions play a significant role in your sense of happiness. Feeling alone can amplify hopelessness, but it’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this journey. There are people who care about you and want to support you.
Consider talking to a trusted family member or seeking professional support. Sharing your feelings can provide relief and help you gain perspective. Finding a counselor you feel comfortable with can offer ongoing support tailored to your needs.
While you navigate these challenges, try to re-engage with activities you used to enjoy, even if it’s just for a short time each day. Taking small, manageable steps can help build confidence and reduce feelings of burnout. Focus on self-care and set realistic goals for your academics. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can help you regain a sense of control.
Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to seek help. We’re here to support you, and we care about your well-being. Take care, and I hope things start to feel more manageable for you soon.",,1,,,,,

I was told that once. Is it my fault that I want to be alone? No, right? It’s normal, but apparently mine is an ‘unhealthy’ hobby. I find solace in being alone, talking to myself, dealing with my emotions myself. I am a very private person in terms of my problems. I joke about my traumatic events with my friends no matter how deep it has scarred me. Privacy and being alone is one of my favourite past times.
But, despite that, I crave affection. Quality time, words of validation. All that stuff, I desperately yearn for that. But it is so repulsive with some people. They like me, they care for me, I can tell. The way they would laugh around me, wagging their tail like a dog, following me around. I enjoy the short time I have with them, the few hours of pure joy I would experience. But after that, I would feel silent annoyance. “Why did I show them that much affection. I better distance myself” And then I do distance myself. I reject whatever they offer us to do, with the stupid excuse of ‘being busy’, and then I would go hangout by myself.
I would feel happy, and then hate that I felt happy around them. I would want to distance myself away, wanting to just cut them from my life. I feel like such a hypocrite. Hanging out with them, and then just hating that I did such silly things…with them of all people. I don’t like them, but why do I feel happy around them, and disgusted at that fact after…?
Is this normal to feel? Am I the bad guy? For showing so much affection towards someone I would show disdain to the next day? Please, give me an honest answer.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for bravely bringing this up. Please do not feel alone as what you are currently feeling is fully validated, not uncommon and understandable. It’s a complex mix of emotions, and I believe the following could help you gain more clarity:
2. You crave affection, validation, quality time and words of affirmation from others, which is a natural human need.
3. However you also fear intimacy and attachment. Due to past traumas or experiences, you might be hesitant to form close relationships or feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness.
4. To protect yourself, you distance yourself from others to maintain control and avoid potential hurt or rejection.
5. You feel hypocritical for enjoying time with others and then pushing them away, leading to self-doubt, self criticism and negative self-talk.
6. You experience happiness in social situations, but later feel annoyed or disgusted, indicating a struggle to reconcile your desires for connection and independence.
It’s not about being the “bad guy” or intentionally hurting others. Your behavior is a coping mechanism, a way to navigate complex emotions and protect yourself from potential pain. However, it’s essential to recognize that this pattern might be limiting your ability to form meaningful, lasting relationships.
Consider seeking support from a therapist to work through these feelings and develop healthier attachment styles. With self-reflection and guidance, you can learn to reconcile your desires for connection and independence, leading to more fulfilling relationships and a greater sense of emotional balance which you 100% deserve.",,1,,,,,

But I’ve gone through a few instances that have affected me as a person. Traumatised if you would give a name to it. It’s not good, but not that bad, just there.
I won’t be delving into details, too much of a hassle for me to write down, besides, digital footprint! Anyways, my parents have had many close divorce arguments over my elder brother. Blah blah. But, the one thing that stressed me was the words “Choose now [NAME], me or your mother, if you choose your mom you and them can go and live in the mountains.” Yea. That. This line was bluntly spoken to me at least 5 times up to my current age.
For all of the choices, I only chose my mom and my brother once, And that was when I was 7. When I matured, I started to choose my father. I knew that picking him would be the greater option. He could pave the path of a good future for me. He was the sole bread winner in the house, A man of wealth.
My mom had neither, she is uneducated. But despite that, I still begged. I cried my eyes out, sobbed tears as I stared at her in a daze. Slurring the words: “Please, stay here. Please.”
For 4 years. All instances, she picked my elder brother. I held contempt for my brother over that. Why did she never pick me? He would come back! Why wouldn’t she stay with me!? Even with the threat from my father: “[Name] If you choose to go off with him, don’t you think about coming back to live with us. You can go rent an apartment and work. Leave your daughter, again.”
She was still left with my brother. Of course this was all just episodes. But that shaped me. Made me the person I am today, like she was a sculptor, creating her sculpture but making mistake and not bothering to fix them. Damaging the piece as she continues to make it.
I get jealous now, very jealous of the people I am close to. I want them, I want them to only like me. Whenever I see the stories of their lives, why are they hanging out with other people? I get mad, distant. Why are you with them and not me? I am clearly better.
If they would leave me, I would even go on my knees and beg. I don’t want them to leave me. Please. I just want them to stay with me forever, or till I lose my undying affection for them. But if I don’t like them as much, I will throw them away like a toy. They could love me as much as I love someone else, but if I dislike at least one pointer of theirs. I would flick them away as easy as pie. It irks me that they like me, that they care for me. I feel disgusted that someone I dislike cares about me.
Is this normal? To be so cunning? I don’t know how to feel anymore.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for your courage to reach out to us. I am sorry to hear that you’ve gone through such a difficult and emotional experience.
It’s completely understandable that you’re struggling with feelings of jealousy, insecurity, and confusion. The hurt of being forced to choose between your parents, and feeling abandoned by your mom, can have a deep impact on your attachment styles and relationships.
It’s not uncommon for those among us who have experienced childhood chaos and uncertainty to develop anxious or insecure attachment patterns, which can lead to feelings of jealousy, possessiveness, and a fear of abandonment. It’s like your mind is constantly trying to protect you from the pain of being rejected or abandoned again.
However, it’s great that you’re recognizing these patterns and wanting to understand and change them. That takes a lot of courage and self-awareness.
It might be helpful to speak with a therapist who can support you in working through these feelings and developing healthier attachment styles.
Remember that you deserve to have loving and fulfilling relationships, and it’s okay to take things at your own pace and focus on your own healing. You don’t have to go through this alone.
Please take good care.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through. It’s clear that this situation is causing you a lot of pain and worry. It’s really hard when you deeply care about your friends and are facing the possibility of losing them.
You’ve already taken a big step by acknowledging your part in the conflict and apologizing. That shows a lot of maturity and courage. It must be incredibly tough to have your apology not accepted, and I can understand why you’re feeling so distressed.
When people get hurt, they sometimes need space to recover. Giving them a bit of time can help heal the wounds. While you’re trying to mend these friendships, it’s important to be kind to yourself. Everyone makes mistakes, and what matters is how we learn and grow from them.
Since you mentioned knowing you hurt them, understanding the deeper reasons behind the conflict and their perspective might give you some insight into why they’re finding it hard to forgive right now. Have you had a chance to think about what specifically led to this situation?
In the meantime, talking to other supportive friends, family, or even a counselor about how you’re feeling might be helpful. Having a support system can make a big difference.
Once you feel ready and have focused on self-improvement, reaching out to your friends again might be beneficial. Focus on listening to their feelings and concerns. Sometimes, people need to feel really heard and understood before they can move forward. Writing a letter or a message where you carefully explain your feelings and acknowledge their hurt could also help.
Remember, take care of yourself, and I hope things get better for you soon. We’re here for you, and we care about your well-being.",,0,,,,,

Whenever someone critise me or if i do badly in a exam i always pushed away the negetive emotions as my friends did badly and need me to comfort them . I cant comfort them if i am sad too , so i tend to push my emotions away and tell myself to work harder and to not let anything make me feel anything .

This year when i finally decided to allow myself to feel to get attached to someone she ended up betraying my trust and took another person side…I hated how it affected me , it made me feel angry i didnt want to forgive her .

Thank you for continuing to share your experiences. I can see that you’ve been dealing with a lot, and it’s incredibly brave of you to open up about these feelings.
It sounds like you’ve been putting a lot of pressure on yourself to only show happiness around others. This must be incredibly draining and lonely. It’s okay to feel and express negative emotions, and doing so does not make you a burden to others.
I understand that you’ve been hurt in the past when you allowed yourself to get close to someone, and this has made you even more hesitant to show vulnerability. This is a natural response to being hurt, but it’s important to work towards accepting your emotions and finding healthy ways to express them.
Here are a few steps that might help:
2. Acknowledge Your Emotions: It’s okay to feel sad, angry, or exhausted. These feelings are valid and important. Allow yourself to acknowledge them without judgment.
3. Express Your Feelings: Start with small steps. You could try writing down your thoughts and feelings in a journal. If you feel comfortable, talk to a trusted friend or family member about what you’re going through.
4. Build Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself. Understand that it’s okay to have emotions and that they don’t make you weak or imperfect. Everyone has moments of vulnerability, and it’s a natural part of life.
Your frustration and confusion about why you hate emotions and feel the way you do are completely understandable. These feelings are rooted in past experiences and the pressure you’ve put on yourself to be perfect.
Lauren, I noticed that you have also made similar posts on other channels, it’s clear from all your posts that you’ve been struggling with similar issues, remember, you don’t have to go through this alone. We’re here for you, and we care about your well-being.
If its ok with you, I would like to put the other two links here and share how we can progress from multiple conversations?

I am writing this because I am anxious about a reference check for an upcoming job interview.

how i came to think about job finding is that there can be equal power and control from both employers and employees. youre choosing your employer as much as they are choosing you. you may have aspects that are less ideal but believing you also have good qualities that makes you unique and valuable, actively finding them and practice how you share those good qualities you feel for for yourself, those are yours to own. combining both good and not so good qualities, you are valuable in your own way. starting there will then feel like half the battle won yk, so its about you finding the right fit for you as much as the company finds you as a good fit for them~
a company who rejects you because of your alleged poor past behaviour alone is also not a company you want, so it works out well! youre in control here okie!!!
first embrace yourself for who you are, and other things can follow suit!!

on practical notes, you can choose supporters of you as your reference check (for example a senior colleague/teacher/mentor etc), does not necessarily have to be your immediate manager in the previous employment even if its the norm usually. at least thats how i see it hehe.",,0,,,,,

It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about the reference check process, especially when your past job performance wasn’t what you hoped it would be. I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to reach out and seek advice on this matter.
Firstly, it’s important to recognize that people do change and grow, and past behavior doesn’t have to dictate your future. Your awareness of past mistakes and your desire to improve are significant strengths. Although we cannot control what employers will do and if they will consider other factors, it very clear that you wish to seek improvements, as this is who are you presently and you want to make a difference for the future.
Here are a few suggestions that might help you navigate this situation:

When my dance teacher and relatives kept critising my body even though i am at a normal healthy weight i told myself i cant be sad or angry at them and that feeling negetives towards a person is bad . I dont want people to see me as overdramatic or troublesome for sharing my probelms . When my close friend choose someone else rather than me i felt sad and i wasnt angry at her but myself for feeling emotions towards someone who couldnt care less about me . I dont know how to love someone , no matter how hard i try to cry infront of someone and tell them all my problems i cant even with my best friend of 8 years . I hate feeling anything towards a person this started ever since i was young . Whenever i started opening myself up to people they start realising i am not as perfect as they thought i was . They wanted a therapist who doesn’t burden them with their problems and i wanted a friend . They all leave in the end , even my piano teacher that i known since i was a child told my mother she didnt want to teach me anymore because i was a slower than the other kids , i didnt feel anything when i heard that . I started gaslighthing myself that i was happy all the time , that i should be grateful that people want to hang out with me . I try to show signs of distress to my friends at times hoping at least one of them would think i need comfort but usually they never notice . They think i am a strong person who doesnt need help or attention because that was ehat i showed to them . But in reality i just want someone to ask me for once if i was okay , or that i am good enough. I am sick of always being there for others but no one is there for me when i need them the most . Because i thought that not feeling emotions were a normal thing i started despising people for being emotional , when they cried after they did badly for a exam i cant help for think they are being pathetic for showing others this imperfect side of them . I hated it when people felt angry because their friend ditched them because i was so used to forgiving everyone around me . Maybe i am the problem , i just hate people who dont present themselves as strong and independent . This may sound weird but i expect people to present to me their perfect self if they expect me to do the same .

Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and feelings with us. It takes a lot of courage to open up about such personal struggles, and I want to acknowledge how strong you are for doing so.
It sounds like you’ve been carrying a heavy burden by trying to suppress your negative emotions and present a perfect front to others. This must be incredibly exhausting and isolating. It’s completely understandable to feel frustrated and overwhelmed by these feelings.
I want to reassure you that feeling emotions, whether they are positive or negative, is a natural and essential part of being human. It’s okay to feel sad, angry, or exhausted. These feelings don’t make you weak or imperfect; they make you human.
It’s also understandable to feel hurt and disappointed when people you care about don’t seem to notice your distress. You deserve to have your feelings acknowledged and supported.
There isnt anything wrong with you, you are just learning to discover and understanding what is the best way to deal with your internal conflict.
Here are a few steps that might help:
2. It’s important to recognize and validate your feelings. Allow yourself to feel without judgment.
3. Consider writing down your thoughts and emotions in a journal. If you feel comfortable, talk to a trusted friend or family member about what you’re going through.
4. Be kind to yourself. Understand that it’s okay to have emotions and that they don’t make you weak or imperfect. Everyone has moments of vulnerability, and it’s a natural part of life.
I understand that opening up can be scary, especially if you fear rejection or judgment. But remember, true friends will accept you for who you are, including your imperfections.
Lauren, I noticed that you have also made similar posts on other channels, it’s clear from all your posts that you’ve been struggling with similar issues around your emotions and vulnerability. It’s incredibly tough to feel like you have to suppress your feelings and present a perfect front to others.
You’ve shown incredible strength by reaching out and sharing your thoughts. It’s not easy to navigate these challenges, but your willingness to seek solutions shows your resilience. Remember, you don’t have to go through this alone. We’re here for you, and we care about your well-being.
Please take care of yourself, and keep us updated on how you’re doing. You’re doing a great job by seeking help and working through these feelings.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your experience. It sounds incredibly challenging, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to feel this way about something you once loved so much. Your passion for dancing is clear, and it’s understandable why the current situation is causing you so much distress.
Receiving constant criticism without constructive feedback can be very demoralizing, especially when you’re putting in so much effort and seeing your own improvements. It’s important to recognize that you’re doing a great job by continuing to practice and striving to get better. The criticism from your coach and classmates, without any guidance on how to improve, must be incredibly frustrating and disheartening.
The incident where you fell on stage and your coach didn’t show concern is particularly hurtful. It’s natural to feel upset when someone you look up to doesn’t seem to care about your well-being. This lack of empathy from your coach, combined with the feeling of being unfairly targeted, is understandably making you lose confidence.
Here are a few steps that might help you navigate this situation:
2. It’s okay to feel hurt and frustrated. These feelings are valid, and recognizing them is the first step towards addressing them.
3. Consider having a conversation with your coach. Express how the constant criticism without constructive feedback is affecting you. Ask for specific guidance on how you can improve. Let him know that positive reinforcement and constructive criticism would be more helpful.
4. Talk to some of your dance classmates who might understand what you’re going through. Sometimes, sharing your feelings with others who can relate can provide comfort and new perspectives.
5. Start by dancing in a safe and supportive environment. Practice in front of friends or family who are encouraging. Gradually build up to larger audiences as your confidence grows.
6. If possible, seek feedback from another dance coach or mentor. A fresh perspective might provide the constructive guidance you need and reassure you about your progress.
7. It’s important to take care of your mental and emotional well-being. Engage in activities that make you happy and relaxed. Consider speaking with a therapist if you continue to feel overwhelmed by these emotions.
Remember, your love for dancing is a significant part of who you are. Don’t let this situation take away the joy it brings you. You’ve shown incredible strength and resilience by continuing to practice despite the challenges. Keep believing in yourself and your abilities. You’re doing an amazing job, and it’s okay to seek help and support when you need it.
Hear from you soon.",,1,,,,,

I need to load off some of my thoughts here as I don’t know who else I can talk this with anyone.
About 2 years ago, I got married and relocated to another place with different language and culture that I usually used daily. At first, I was excited to relocate as it is a beginning of a new life for me. I don’t have any close friends in my new place except my husband. I also work remotely from other place, so I really have limited interaction with community. After the honeymoon period is off, I feel that I doesn’t belong in the new place and have the urges to go back to my parent’s house. I even got afraid to purchase food from local people. I always asked my husband to buy me a meal. At one point I also feel afraid to search for a new job at the new place, one of the biggest reason is I’m afraid that I cannot fit in in the society. It’s been a long time since I met new people and have a conversation. I don’t even feel I can talk about this with my husband. Any suggestions that might help?",,1,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts. It sounds like you’re going through a challenging time, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to open up about these feelings. Relocating to a new place with a different language and culture can be incredibly overwhelming. The excitement of a new beginning often fades, leaving behind feelings of isolation and fear. It’s understandable to feel disconnected and anxious in such a situation.
From what you’ve described, it’s clear that you’re feeling a lot of emotional distress. Moving to a new place and not having a support network around you is very difficult. It’s completely normal to feel afraid and out of place when everything around you is so different from what you’re used to.
You mentioned that you’re afraid to purchase food from local people and that you ask your husband to buy meals for you. It’s important to recognize that these feelings of fear and anxiety are valid. Relocating and adjusting to a new culture can be daunting, especially when you don’t have close friends or a support system nearby.
It also sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of self-doubt and fear about fitting into your new society. This is a common reaction to such a significant life change, and it’s okay to feel this way. The fact that you’re aware of these feelings and reaching out for help shows a lot of strength and self-awareness.
Here are a few steps that might help you feel more connected and less isolated:
2. Start Small: Try to gradually increase your interactions with locals. Maybe start by purchasing food from local vendors once a week. This can help build your confidence over time. Even small victories can provide a sense of accomplishment and gradually reduce anxiety.
3. Learn the Language: Consider taking a language class. This will help you communicate better and give you a chance to meet people who are also learning. Often, language classes have a social component that can help you feel more connected.
4. Establish a Routine: Create a daily routine that includes activities you enjoy and some form of physical exercise. Having a structure can provide a sense of normalcy and purpose, making the new environment feel more manageable.
5. Join Online Communities: Connect online with groups or forums whom have relocated to where you are staying now. This can provide a sense of community and support, even if it’s virtual. Sometimes, sharing experiences with others in similar situations can be incredibly validating.
6. Talk to Your Husband or Parents: You may feel that you can’t talk about this with your husband, but the reality could be your husband is the actual help that you need. Share your feelings with him or your parents. He/they might not be aware of the extent of your distress, and discussing it can provide relief and understanding. Having an open line of communication can strengthen your relationship and provide you with emotional support.
7. Seek Counseling: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in expatriate or relocation issues. They can provide strategies to manage your anxiety and feelings of isolation. Professional support can be very effective in helping you navigate these emotions.
Remember, there are many things right with you — you’re just in a very challenging situation. The feelings of sadness, fear, and anxiety you’re experiencing are normal responses to such significant life changes.
You’ve already shown resourcefulness by reaching out and seeking help. It’s okay to take things one step at a time. You’re not alone in this, and it’s important to be kind to yourself as you navigate these challenges. Take care, feel free to posty here again if you need guidance.",,2,,22130,,22130.0,

Ever since I was around 12 and up until now, I don’t really get along with my mom. I love her so much and I know I do but for some reason I always have this lingering feeling that I don’t. I started to realise that my family and I have issues with communication and tend to have very heated arguments. I obviously love them and we have our bonding and silly moments. When the fights do happen though, it gets heated that I cry and get so frustrated and for some reason the only thoughts that fill my head are anger and what life will be like if I was just gone. I have thought of self harm before but I am terrified of it and I think back about if I really do want my life to end. I mean, I made it this far in life and have a loving family and that’s everything I could’ve asked for. I hate myself for being so sensitive and having all these horrible thoughts. I can’t help but feel like im not being appreciative of my life and family. The worse part is that when I know that I can be happy. I can be deemed a normal healthy human being. I only feel these intense emotions when I am extremely upset and that’s so stupid. Im so selfish and I hate myself for it. Nowadays, I just feel like im living just to get through life. I don’t know what my goal is anymore and I can’t help but notice that what once used to excite me and make me happy are slowly no longer doing those things. I just sometimes feel like I want to lie in bed and stay there forever. I don’t know if these feelings are normal but every time I get concerned with myself I ask myself if im just being over dramatic and a sensitive idiot. I cry over the smallest of things and I noticed that ive been more agitated and annoyed. It just feels so wrong to me that I have these thoughts and emotions when I know im very lucky to be healthy and in a wonderful family I can come home to. I used to always vent these feelings out in my phones notes app and they have been going for a few years now. I struggle with how I look aswell. I can’t go a long time without checking a mirror or being anxious with the way I look. I get persistent and intrusive thoughts about perceived flaws or defects in my body.I often disengage myself in social activities because of concerns about my appearance. I also feel like my personality is changing and I just can’t help but feel sad about it. I lack empathy now and i get so annoyed at people for absolutely no reason. I can smile, laugh, feel happy, and talk to people normally so I really don’t get why I feel this so strongly when im hurt deeply emotionally.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your innermost thoughts and intense feelings with me. It takes a huge dose of courage to be honest and open about your struggles.
Firstly, please know that your feelings are fully valid and not stupid at all. It’s 100% normal to have complex emotions, especially during difficult times.
I believe the following could help you as you navigate the challenges and struggles you are facing :
- Most families comprise of members with different temperaments and personalities - and this adds to the complexity present in families. You have articulated it very well - there are both good and bad times. While the good times are the best and everyone is bonded and united, the challenging times understandably deeply affect you especially when there are heated arguments which fill you with doubt and hurt. Understandably this family dynamics is taking a toll on your well-being. Consider seeking family therapy to address these issues.
- You’re experiencing intense emotions, which can be overwhelming. To achieve emotional regulation, practise self-compassion, and explore healthy coping mechanisms like mindfulness, exercise, or creative activities. Speak to a counsellor who can help you regulate emotions.
- Your struggles with appearance and perceived flaws are common. Please do consider seeking help from a therapist or counsellor to address these issues.
- As for personality changes, it is normal for personalities to evolve. In fact everyday, you are learning new things and thus adjusting how you see yourself and the world. I suggest you can write down some of your strengths, what you want to achieve and and areas of development. Also, with daily mindfulness and reflection, you can achieve greater self awareness. Again, speaking with a counsellor who can facilitate this processing could prove useful.
- Take small steps to inculcate the practice of empathy and understanding towards yourself and others. Slow down and choose to be empathetic, optimistic and nurturing.
Remember, you’re not alone in your struggles. Be kind to yourself, and don’t hesitate to seek help when needed. Keep in mind that you’re strong and capable, and there’s certainly hope for growth and improvement. Take small steps towards healing, and celebrate your tiny victories along the way!",,1,,,,,

I have been stuck with a bad case of on-and-off insomnia for the past two years. After particularly disastrous A level preparation period, I have been having trouble sleeping at least twice a week.
Even when I’m not anxious, my body produces symptoms like stomachaches and bloating which give me trouble sleeping. It’s frustrating because I have never pulled any all-nighters but I’m still experiencing the same quality or quantity of sleep.
When I brought it up to friends, they said that they do not have the same problem, then they started talking about how insomnia is really bad for the body. When I told my parents, they said that it’s something I have to learn how to manage on my own.

I’m sorry to hear how you’re struggling with insomnia and its effects on your physical and mental well-being. Thank you for the courage to seek help .
I fully agree that preparing for the 'A ’ levels is highly stressful. Fortunately those exams are now over. You traced the onset of the sleep troubles to the stress of that exam preparation. Sadly, since then, it has been challenging to adjust back to your regular sleep pattern. You also experience symptoms like stomachaches and bloating which are contributing to the sleep trouble. Though you may not be feeling understood or supported by loved ones when you share your experiences, please take heart that you are not alone in this struggle. Insomnia is a common issue that can affect anyone, regardless of their sleep habits or lifestyle.
There are professionals you can tap on who understand and can offer guidance. Have you considered seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor? If you are currently in school, set up an appointment with your school counsellors. They can help you develop coping strategies and address underlying issues contributing to insomnia. For example, they would help you identify your thoughts around sleep and facilitate you in reframing them. They could help you examine your current routines, and identify patterns or habits that may inadvertently be affecting sleep quality.
Meanwhile, I encourage you to also consider these proactive steps to manage your insomnia and overall well-being. Consider exploring and find for yourself the optimal mix which works best for you from these suggested techniques:
- Physical activity and exercise (this should be at least 4 hours before bedtime)
- Mindfulness practice (can help you lower stress levels)
- Relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation)
- Sleep hygiene practices (e.g., consistent sleep schedule, dark sleep environment, no electronic devices 1 hour prior to bedtime)
To address your concerns about the long-term effects of insomnia, the research in this area has been quite varied. I recommend you to not be unduly worried about lifespan as many other factors (both known and unknown by researchers) contribute to quality of life and lifespan. I encourage you to stay focused on making daily incremental improvements.
Stay optimistic and keep taking small steps daily to improve sleep.",,2,,,,,

@anonymous339 shared a useful tool, @CaringBee also shared some amazing techniques, I just wanted to second what caringbee said to not be too worried about lifespan because while our lifestyle plays a part in our lifespan, there are a variety of factors that affects lifespan and it’s out of our control/ our reach.
Just take small steps daily to improve our sleep, be it by addressing our anxiety, meditation, relaxation practices and practicing sleep hygiene, it’s important to find what works for you and it’s ok to reach out for help like seeking help form a doctor to talk about your issues if it continues to persist/ bother you.

Then, she decided that i did not fulfil her idea of a sister and thus, disconnected me from being “her sister”. We continued to be (close). But at least in the last year, she started to distance herself further. Not communicating, not sharing. When i asked her about her life, she would snap at me telling me to respect her personal space and boundary. It was her birthday, i had ordered a cake intending to pass it to her as a surprise in the morning before work. But the day before, she told me that she would not go to work on her birthday. I had to tell her then about the cake and asked her how then, if i could just meet her in the morning to pass her the cake. The day ended badly because she said i texted her much and asking how she was spending the day. She retorted that it was her time off. That i intruded into her personal space. The conversation ended with if i do not respect her personal space, no point to be friends. She was not willing to understand me. If i do not meet her expectations, we will not be friends. I called her out to talk. The conversation went with us shouting at each other in the eatery. Where, she told me that she wanted to never be friends with me for a few years now.

I am sorry to hear about the loss of the friendship. Thank you for the courage to seek help. Friendship breakups are indeed very painful, especially since you once even shared a sisterhood in the past and were close friends.
Sadly, she had been distancing herself prior to the break up and this has left you hurt and confused till today as there was no clear reasons given by her for her pulling away and disconnecting from you. The last conversation was especially bitter and hurtful. Your feelings of grief, loss and abandonment are 100% valid and understandable.
Please hang in there. Sadly, it will take time for the pain to lessen and the loss to reduce its grip on you. I encourage you to speak to a counsellor who can help you process your thoughts, emotions and sensations in a safe, caring and non-judgmental space. If there are close family members you can confide in, reach out to them for support as you go through this grief cycle. You are not alone nor unwanted so don’t ever feel that way.
Meanwhile I encourage you can consider the following to soften the impact as you journey towards acceptance :
- People’s priorities and behaviours do change over time and that may have contributed to her decision to choose a pathway and a direction away from you.
- She may have an unrealistic expectations and idealized notion of what a “sister” should be.
- Good friendships are based on mutual understanding, give and take, open communication and respect. I encourage you to reflect if these were present in your relationship with her.
- While boundaries are important, it is a red flag if they become increasingly rigid, ad hoc and baseless.
I fully agree it’s difficult so take it one day at a time and slowly accept that the friendship has run its course, and it’s okay to move on.
Be kind to yourself, while you are grateful for the fond memories you have had with her, acknowledge that the chapter in your life has now closed, Gently let her go. Take care of yourself, exercise, sleep well, participate in enjoyable activities and hobbies, and spend time with loved ones.
Once you feel better, tap on this experience to learn and grow, identifying any patterns or areas for improvement in your relationships. Focus on nurturing other friendships and relationships where you feel valued and respected.
Remember, you 100% deserve to be treated with kindness and understanding.

the whole cake thing suggests to me that she’s going through a period where she doesn’t want interaction with anyone. or is having intense mood swings. this could be depression (?).
i would firstly apologise for disrespecting their personal space (even if you didn’t) and say that it was not on purpose. then, get them calm by apologising for a bunch of stuff and explaining your reasoning while reiterating that that reasoning might have been wrong.

I wanted to ask for help! I have 2 job offers currently and I am really unsure if which I want. Ik that in the end of the day, I am supposed to be the one making the decision but the problem is, idk what I even want. My dream job doesnt want me and I have no other choices but to go with these 2…
Both r in the finance industry and it is sth tbh i really not that interested in as compared to my dream industry… If i wanna go to my dream industry, I will need to restart and wait until the application open which means a period of unemployment again, while i can do part time but i kinda need a job right now so dream industry is out of the question which could ponder in the future. Kinda regretted not doing my job search or research about the opportunities during my career break tho cuz I realised how many great opportunities I have missed.
Back to the 2 jobs, Job A has more growth and learning but I am required to do a task i do not like ( aka sales) which i am not confident in but the growth really alot as I can experience many stuff
Job B while is in the area of interest, i feel that the growth wont be as much and I have to be really independent. The pros is that I have high autonomy to do my own things as long as I complete my task, grow my own team, coming up with my own proposal and in a long run ( probs 1 year) I get to be a leader which has power, sth I appreciate but the growth will be alot and i can foresee myself doing mundane work for quite a period to achieve it and my imagination does not mean it will become reality…
And I have a lot of self doubt, worry that my past poor performance will affect my future work… I have really low confidence about myself and dont believe in myself…
So i am really torn and i need an advice… I really sucks at making decision and i dont want to make decision i regret… I have ask people arnd me but none can provide me with an advice that brings me so strongly of one decision… I am so torn to the point I have no appetite to est, cant sleep well anxious for a few days… If it is a job I really want, all these wouldnt even be required…
Really need a compelling advice and ik at the end of the day is my choice( ik but i really dw to hear)",,1,,,,,

Firstly, well done on getting two job offers in the finance industry. This shows that interviewers have selected you and have assessed that you have the merit, requisite background, skills and attributes to succeed in these roles.
Thank you, too, for the courage to share that you also have another dream job in mind. I understand that it may require you to restart your career back by bringing you back to the starting blocks and something you cannot do at the present time, though it could be something you could pursue eventually. Please don’t be too hard on yourself for missing the application period and for missing opportunities. It happens to the best of us. That does not mean all is lost. Don’t lose heart; It may be worth a shot to explore this further once the situation is more stable.
Meanwhile, keep an open mind as you explore Finance and different fields. Finance might not be your passion, but it could provide valuable skills and experience.
Now to the issue of deciding which of the two job offers to pursue. Yes, a difficult decision indeed! You analysed it well when you mentioned there are pros and cons to both jobs.
A good first step I recommend is to raise your self-awareness on your own preferences. For example, you could take the RIASEC profiling to understand your personality, strengths, and work values to help you identify suitable career options. MySkillsFuture website has excellent resources you can tap on. Assessment Tool | Myskillsfuture.gov.sg
The next step I recommend is for you to assess which of the two roles is more aligned to your personal values and goals. Do you thrive in a role where you need to analyse, come up with procedures or do you prefer roles where you are required to conceptualise or engage with people. Compare if possible against the dream job. Which of these two roles consists of more aspects of the dream job. I believe that could help you in making the choice.
Remember, there’s no perfect choice, and it’s okay to take calculated risks. You can always adjust your path later.
While you decide which role to choose, I want to take this opportunity to assure you that it’s fully understandable and normal that you are experiencing self-doubt and worry about past performance. I want to reassure you that past experiences do not define your future. Circumstances are different and you have grown since then. Stay optimistic, focused and apply what lessons you’ve learned from those past roles. Starting the new job is an opportunity for a new start and new beginning.
Additionally:
- Set clear goals for your next role.
- Prioritize your well-being and confidence-building.
- Seek mentorship or guidance from professionals in your desired field.
- Embrace the learning process and view challenges as growth opportunities.
You got this! Take your time, and trust yourself to make the best decision for your current situation.",Assessment Tool | Myskillsfuture.gov.sg 3 https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/assessment/landing.html,2,,,,,

Thank you for your kind words .
Your worry about mental health is fully understandable as you venture into a new role. There is a level of uncertainty which I agree is daunting. I am gathering that you are experiencing fear, self doubt and worry among many other emotions. Please do not be discouraged, what you are experiencing is valid and commonly felt among most new-joiners, so don’t feel alone .
I hope these guidelines can help you cope better:
Have realistic expectations that no job is perfect, and it is not possible for you to know everything about the job within the first few days. It takes at least 100 days or more of onboarding before a new-joiner can adequately understand their new role/industry/culture/procedures. Be kind to yourself and be patient.
Be fully present and pay attention when undergoing any briefing or on the job training. If you don’t fully understand anything, write it down, think through, read the manual or SOP to get a basic understanding first. Thereafter ask your supervisor or assigned mentor. It shows initiative and openness to learn. Get hands-on practice where possible.
Carry out regular self-care. Exercise, sleep, hobbies, good diet all help to reduce stress and promote your well-being.
Tap on your strong support system of family and friends. They can provide a cushion and a sense of camaraderie that you can fall back for emotional and social support. A counsellor could also help you identify and develop skills to navigate challenges you may face in your new role. Counsellors can provide a safe space for you to process your emotions and coach you on developing skills to weather them.
Do prioritise your mental health and proactively seek support to ease yourself into the transition coming up. You are not alone, and the way forward is by taking small daily steps that bring you towards the desired direction. You got this!",,1,,,,,

I’ve had a lot of thoughts about it but right now I’d just like to enquire about a particular one.
All the days leading up to my last day, some of my colleagues jokingly ask me to convert to doing the job full-time because they say I’m a good worker and they’ll miss me when I’m gone. Of course, I appreciate the compliments, but also, I’m aware that after my departure, there will be some new people coming in to replace me.
And it just has me wondering like, I mean I know they mean it but come on, am I really that special? I bet they felt the same way towards the temporary workers before me, and they’ll feel the same towards the people who come in after me. Maybe the sentiment won’t be exactly the same, but the point is that they’ll get used to and enjoy the presence of these new people once they’re trained and know the job and once they’re used to them.
And the conflicting part here is that I tend to sometimes be a little arrogant about myself - I don’t boast to the people around me, but I do tend to think my opinions are the right ones sometimes until I’m proven wrong.
How normal is it to have this particular set of conflicting traits - being arrogant enough to think I’m always right (sometimes), yet also having such low self-esteem resulting in me genuinely believing I’m not that special to these people because they’ll have / had the same feeling for others?",,0,22092.0,,,,

I can relate, I’m currently on internship and I had colleagues said I did a great job and that I should convert to full time because they “need” me and I’m great at what I do but deep down I know that I’m replaceable but that doesn’t take away or make it any less true about what my colleagues said.
Everyone is special and bring something unique to the table, they’ll miss you for your presence and contribution. It’s wonderful to know you made a great impression on them.
I would say it’s ok and normal to have conflicting traits/ feelings, many of us can feel confident one moment and doubtful the next. It doesn’t mean you’re not special or that your impact isn’t real. It just shows you’re human.
Acknowledge that you’ve done a great job, you should be proud of that while also staying humble and being open and embrace new experiences.

Thank you for reaching out.
Firstly, good job on successfully completing your temporary role well😊. I think that is a laudable achievement as you had just transitioned out of school and bravely took up the challenge to venture into the working world.
From your sharing, I believe your colleagues appreciate your efforts, work ethics and sense of responsibility when they said you are a good colleague. Do take a moment to reflect on the new skills, work experience and happy memories you now have when you worked well with these colleagues.
As you correctly pointed out, with you moving on to study, replacement temp hires are needed.
Your colleagues will commence to interview, hire, and train these replacements; some will stay on and eventually most would leave too and replaced by a newer batch. I gather it is a cycle your full-time colleagues are used to, but I believe they will always remember you fondly as they enjoyed working with you. I even think this role may be a possible job option for you to consider in the future!
You have shared courageously that you have conflicting traits like arrogance and low self-esteem and wonder how normal it is. I hope these insights could help:
• Human personality is multifaceted. Hence it is common and normal to have contradictory characteristics.
• Sometimes the expression of our personality depends on the context. Arrogance may surface in specific situations or topics where you feel more confident, while you feel low self-esteem in other areas which are unfamiliar.
• The very fact that you recognise these contradictions suggests to me that you have started developing more self-awareness. That is a sign of growth and maturity. You can speak to a counsellor and set a goal to raise your self-awareness further – especially finding your values, strengths, personality traits and areas to develop. For example, the counsellor can help you develop assertiveness skills and ways to raise self-esteem.
• Your ability to question your own importance and consider others’ perspectives suggests to me you already possess the qualities of humility and empathy. That counteracts the quality of being arrogant.
Your personal growth journey awaits you as you develop from strength to strength! With continuous reflection and consistent effort, who you are and what makes you tick will only get clearer .",,1,,,,,

I am actively working on managing my overthinking tendencies to address this issue effectively.",,0,,,,,
13221,Panic Attack,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/panic-attack/13221,Coping,---,7296,CoolBreeze,Professional,Professional,20317,2,"Dear @Juicy ,
Thank you for coming here to share your experiences with us. It sounds like you’re navigating a tough situation in your relationship, and it’s admirable that you’re taking ownership of your part in the disagreement. Recognising the impact of our actions is the first step towards healing and reconciliation. Well done!
I can see from your thoughtful reflection that you deeply value your relationship and are committed to improving it. Your willingness to acknowledge your feelings and actively work on managing them shows signs of emotional intelligence and maturity. It’s evident that you’re invested in understanding yourself and your partner better, which is crucial for building a strong foundation in any relationship.
Disagreements are common and natural in healthy relationships. What often matters more is how we repair and reconnect afterwards. This ability to repair can provide reassurance that it’s okay to have disagreements without fear of abandonment. Here are some basic repairing skills you can consider:
2. Active Listening: Practice active listening by fully focusing on what your partner is saying without interrupting.Paraphrase back what you hear to offer understanding and validation.
3. Taking Responsibility: Acknowledge your part in the disagreement and apologise sincerely if necessary. Avoid blame and focus on finding solutions together.
4. Compromise: Be willing to find middle ground or solutions that meet both your needs. This shows respect for each other’s perspectives and fosters cooperation.
Panic attacks can serve as protective mechanisms triggered by deeper emotional issues beyond the recent disagreement. Uncovering the root cause of these reactions can reduce their intensity and frequency, benefiting both your personal well-being and the health of your relationship. Seeking support from a therapist or counsellor can provide valuable insights and coping strategies to manage these challenges effectively.
Here are some steps you can consider:
2. Open Communication: Schedule regular check-ins with your partner to discuss your feelings and progress. For example, set aside time each week to share how you’re feeling and what steps you’re taking to address your overthinking tendencies. Use “I” statements to express yourself without placing blame, such as “I feel anxious when…” or “I’m working on managing my overthinking by…”
3. Seek Support: Consider seeking support from a couples therapist or a trusted friend or family member who can provide guidance and perspective. A neutral third party can help facilitate constructive conversations and offer strategies for rebuilding trust.
4. Self-Care: Prioritise your emotional well-being by practising self-care techniques that help manage stress and anxiety. This could include mindfulness exercises, regular physical activity, or journaling to reflect on your feelings and experiences.
Healing relationships often require understanding, empathy, and ongoing effort from both individuals as well as individually.
If you’re comfortable, please let us know if this was your first experience with a panic attack, or if there is a history of them. How did you manage the panic attack? Additionally, what strategies are you using to actively manage your overthinking tendencies and address the mistrust?
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

During that break, she told me that she wasn’t ready for a relationship, which broke my heart. In the same week, I was scammed, which made it really hard for me to open up to my parents. Eventually, I did manage to tell them, and the scam was reported, but it took a toll on my mental health.
I felt unproductive for a while until my graduation day when my girlfriend reached out to reconcile. We decided to give our relationship another try. However, shortly after, I said something that I didn’t think was a big deal, but it brought up trust issues for her. On a subsequent date, she asked me a question that seemed to imply she thought I might be microcheating. I wasn’t aware of my tone, and while I didn’t snap at her, I struggled to express myself clearly, which led to her losing trust in me. This triggered my first panic attack, where my hands and feet felt cold, and I had a nauseous sensation.
I opened up to her and apologized, explaining how I felt. She then told me that she had resented me for a while, which affected me deeply. I told her that I forgave her and myself for what had happened, although I know I haven’t fully forgiven myself yet, and I often overthink the situation.
What triggers my panic attack is the thought of her leaving in which internally I may not accepted it yet. I tend to overthink, even though I’ve acknowledged my part in the issues. She has now told me that she doesn’t feel the same way anymore, which has broken my heart again. I’m not sure where things stand until we talk again.

Thanks for sharing more with me. It makes complete sense that your nervous system would feel dysregulated after going through such a series of unfortunate situations. When we feel unsafe, it’s normal for our bodies to react cautiously—it’s how our body protects us, and this can sometimes manifest as hesitations in our responses.
Overthinking is also a common coping response to feeling unsafe. It’s a top-down approach where we use our brains to rationalise and find solutions to potential problems. Originally meant as a protective measure, it can sometimes overwhelm us and cause more harm than good. I strongly encourage you to try a bottom-up approach—using your body to help regulate your nervous system and create a sense of safety. This might involve activities like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness exercises to calm your mind and body.
Try practicing these strategies every day, even if it’s just for a minute at first, and gradually increase your practice. Begin by becoming aware of when you are overthinking. Awareness is key to breaking the pattern. When you notice you are overthinking, try breaking the cycle by engaging in grounding techniques or physical activities like 5 jumping jack or 10 push ups.
You might also find it helpful to check out videos on managing ANTS (Automatic Negative Thoughts) for additional techniques and support.

I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult time. Breakups can be incredibly painful and can leave you feeling sad and downhearted. It’s important to give yourself permission to grieve and feel these emotions fully.
Here are some steps that might help you during this tough period:
2. Seek Professional Help: If you find it difficult to cope with your emotions or if you’re struggling to move forward, consider seeking support from a counsellor or therapist. They can provide guidance and tools to help you heal and grow from this experience. Please click here for a list of resources .
3. Allow Yourself to Grieve: It’s normal to feel sad and to mourn the loss of the relationship. Allow yourself the time and space to grieve without judgment.
4. Take Care of Yourself: Focus on self-care activities that nurture your well-being. This could include exercise, hobbies you enjoy, spending time in nature, or practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques.
5. Reflect and Learn: Whenever you are ready, you can than take some time to reflect on the relationship and what you’ve learned from it. Consider what aspects you might want to carry forward and what you might want to approach differently in future relationships.
Healing takes time, and it’s okay to not feel okay right now. Be patient and kind to yourself as you navigate through this challenging period.",click here for a list of resources 2 https://mindline.sg/youth/mental-health-service-providers/start,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through. It sounds incredibly tough, and I want to acknowledge how strong you are for reaching out. Your struggle with squeezing your pores and the emotional distress it’s causing you is very real, and it’s important to address it.
You’re already doing so much to try to manage this situation. Sometimes the bravest thing we can do is to hold space for ourselves and attend to our fears and anxieties. It’s not easy, but acknowledging these feelings is a crucial step in taking care of your mental and emotional well-being. Often, when we don’t have a solution to address our fears and anxieties, it can easily trigger us to feel frantic. In searching for a solution, we might tend to “do a lot” or “overdo” things, like squeezing our pores.
I have a few questions that might help us understand your situation better and find the most appropriate support for you:
2. Have you had the chance to talk to a mental health professional about what you’re experiencing? You mentioned wondering if ADHD has something to do with this—did you address this with the doctor who diagnosed you?
3. Mirrors seem to be a significant trigger for you. When you see a mirror, what thoughts or feelings come up for you? Understanding these can be a useful first step in managing the behavior.
4. It sounds like your parents’ reactions are adding to your distress. How do their comments make you feel, and do you think they understand the difficulty you’re facing? Sometimes, discussing these feelings can help find ways to communicate with your parents more effectively.
5. It’s really hard when you feel criticized for something that feels beyond your control. When was the last time, or any other past occasions, that made you feel this way when you were criticized?
6. Have you tried any other ways to distract yourself when you feel the urge to pick? Can you recall if you’ve ever tried anything before?
Remember, it’s okay to seek help. Managing these feelings can be challenging, but with the right support and strategies, it’s possible to find relief and improve your well-being. You’re showing a lot of courage by reaching out and seeking solutions.
Take care, and we hope to hear from you again soon. We’re here for you.",,0,,22026,,22026.0,
14247,I need help,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-need-help/14247,Is This Normal?,---,11654,sleepyowl,User,,22025,1,"For my end-of-semester project in one of my classes, I am in the same group as two of my friends and two other classmates. One of the guys, John, gave me weird vibes from the start. He lied about his name and previous education and mentioned that he likes vandalizing, which made me want to avoid him. However, that didn’t happen. He suddenly became close to two of my friends (who are in the same group as me) and would constantly approach them. Sometimes, when I was nearby, he would say a lot of strange things that creeped me out. For example, once, while we were making a model mouse, he asked my friend if his mouse looked good. When she said it did, he responded, “Yeah, stroke my ego some more.” I was right next to her when he said that.
On the first day we chose our group, John remarked to my friends, “Oh, I never noticed her before,” which they relayed to me. Our class has only 24 people, and we had been in the same class for almost an entire semester. I thought maybe I had no presence and brushed it off. During the second group project session, while my friends and John were talking, I was listening to the teacher. The teacher asked us to write our opinions on a Post-it note. John was holding the Post-it notes, so I told him we needed them to write our opinions. I repeated it because he was just playing with the notes and not acknowledging what I said. I don’t know if he didn’t understand or if I wasn’t speaking clearly, but he suddenly said to me, “Can you shut the f*** up?” My friend and I were shocked. I didn’t know how to respond, so I just stayed silent while he and my friend continued their discussion. Later, my friend told me that before he said that, he had apologized to my friends if he was being rude or annoying.
After that, we needed to take pictures and do some research. John and my friends met up on a Wednesday to work on it, but I couldn’t join because I had to run an errand , so I completed most of my tasks the day before. On Wednesday, John told my friends exactly what they needed to do, and when I asked him what pictures I should take, he gave me a half-hearted response and then told my friends,
“Why is she asking me what she should take?”I asked because i was worried i would miss out something and that he would criticise me for half heartily doing the project
My group was a bit behind schedule, so John wanted to call to do the work. Most of my group mates were free almost every weekday night, but one of my friends was only free on weekend nights. He asked us to specify other days I was free, and every time I gave him a day, he kept saying, “And?” which stressed me out, making me feel like he was pressuring me to provide more dates , i basically stated 5 out of the 6 available days . In the end, he scheduled the call for weekend nights, and one of those nights I wasn’t available due to family matters. I felt like he was catering to one friend and not considering my availability.
We had another day to discuss our project after class. It was quite late, and John was hungry, so he wanted to move to a different location to get food. My friends and I couldn’t stay that late, and he suggested not meeting up. However, we were already at the location waiting for him, so we decided to discuss some things anyway. John eventually arrived, but one group member didn’t come, so we continued discussing without him. During the discussion, he said someone should write down what we were talking about. My friend pulled out her phone to take notes, but he told me I should do it, possibly because I had an iPad. As I was writing, I got confused and stopped. John saw this and told me, “You should write that down.” My friends tried to hold back their laughter. After the meeting, my friends felt like John was treating me like a slave, and I agreed. I felt like he was snapping his fingers in front of my face like I was a dog, and when I tried to explain some criteria we needed to meet, he wouldn’t let me speak.
The final straw was during a call to discuss the project. Before the meeting started, I began feeling stressed and anxious that John would treat me badly, and my heart started racing. Eventually, I calmed down and joined the call. One group mate couldn’t join due to being busy. During the call, we went around in circles, and when the meeting time ended, we decided to text instead. I came up with an idea and sent it to my friend to share with the group. She asked why I didn’t just send it to the group chat, and I told her I was scared. She sent it for me, and I worried John wouldn’t like my idea. My friend said that I had come up with an idea, and without missing a beat, John texted, “I hope you know what you are doing.” At that point, I broke down. I couldn’t handle it anymore; it felt like all the emotions I had been suppressing came out at once. It seemed like he was treating me as if I was an idiot doodling on a piece of paper.
I don’t know what I did to deserve this treatment. I was participating in discussions and pointing out things that others missed. John treats my friends well and babies the other guy, who is essentially useless .

14247,I need help,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-need-help/14247,Is This Normal?,---,11048,FuYuan_Affections,Professional,The Wise,22038,2,"Hi @sleepyowl,
Thank you for sharing your experience in such detail. It’s clear that you’re going through a really tough time, and I want to acknowledge how brave you are for speaking up about it.
From what you’ve described, it sounds like John’s behavior towards you has been consistently inappropriate and disrespectful. He lied about his name and education, made unsettling comments, and treated you rudely when you tried to participate in the group project. It’s understandable that these actions have made you feel uncomfortable and targeted.
You’ve also mentioned feeling excluded and marginalized in the group. John’s dismissive attitude, especially when he ignored your availability and treated you as less capable, is deeply concerning. It’s no wonder you’re feeling stressed and anxious, given the way he’s been treating you.
The impact on your emotional and mental health is evident. it’s clear that John’s behavior is having a significant negative impact on you. The inappropriate comments, exclusionary actions, and overall disrespect are all contributing to your sense of anxiety and helplessness. Your concerns are valid, and it’s important to recognize that the way you’re being treated is not acceptable. The anxiety, stress, and physical symptoms like a racing heart are all significant and shouldn’t be overlooked. It’s important to acknowledge that your feelings of distress are valid, and you have every right to feel the way you do.
I understand that you’re afraid to speak up because you feel like John will paint you as a sensitive and useless person. It’s really challenging to stand up for yourself when you fear being judged or dismissed. However, it’s important to remember that your worth is not determined by what John thinks or says about you.
Whilst you may be thinking about the most appropriate approach and find the right moment to address, I want you to be safe and maybe a few suggestions for you to consider:
2. Document the Behavior: Keep a record of John’s comments and actions that make you uncomfortable. This documentation can be helpful if you decide to seek help from a teacher or counselor.
3. Seek Support from Friends: Talk to your friends in the group about how John’s behavior is affecting you. They might not fully understand the extent of your distress and could provide more support if they are aware.
4. Speak to a Teacher or Counselor: Consider discussing the situation with a teacher or school counselor. They can intervene and help mediate the situation to ensure that everyone is treated respectfully.
5. Practice Self-Care: Taking care of your mental health is crucial. Engage in activities that help you relax and de-stress. Whether it’s talking to a friend, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in a hobby, make sure you’re taking time for yourself.
6. Group Discussion: If you feel comfortable, you could suggest a group discussion to address the project dynamics. This can be an opportunity to express how everyone feels and agree on respectful ways to communicate and collaborate.
You have every right to express your feelings and set boundaries for how you want to be treated. Having said, do you feel that it’s important to address this so you can feel safe and respected in your group? And when you feel that you are ready to address,
7. Set Boundaries: It’s important to set boundaries with John. If he makes inappropriate comments or treats you disrespectfully, calmly let him know that his behavior is not acceptable. For example, you can say, “I don’t appreciate being spoken to that way.”
Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect, and it’s okay to seek help when you’re being mistreated. Your feelings are valid, and addressing this issue is important for your well-being. It’s also important to trust that your friends and teachers will see the truth of the situation and support you. Take care, and please reach out for support. We’re here for you.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out for help. I’m sorry to hear about your struggle.
Please don’t be discouraged, many students do experience loss of motivation to study especially when they have been studying intensively without breaks.
Many students can identify with this struggle - At the back of our mind, we are aware that there is limited time left to study as exams are next week.
However the temptation to use the phone is overwhelming and we give in. Using the phone provides a temporary relief and distraction. It’s like a breath of fresh air.
However, once we realise how much time was spent on the phone, we are faced with feelings of loss and helplessness. Understandably we feel emotional.
It may be helpful to :
2. Reflect on what is behind the motivation loss. Try to identify the reason behind this sudden change. Was there a specific event, thought, or feeling that triggered it? Once you identify the trigger, you can choose your follow up actions mindfully whenever triggered. This gives you more control.
3. Remind yourself what you want to achieve by studying. How does studying help you achieve your aspirations? Fall back on your past. You are a good student and care about your results. You have studied successfully for exams before. What did you do then to get through? You have proven inner resources to overcome this low period. Draw on your strengths.
4. Set boundaries for yourself on phone use, like designating phone-free study sessions or using apps that track and limit your screen time.
5. Allow yourself to feel and process emotions that are coming up. Journaling or talking to someone can help you understand what’s causing these random crying episodes.
6. Despite feeling unmotivated, you still care about your exams. Make a study plan, set achievable goals, and reward yourself for small accomplishments.
7. Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, exercise, and healthy food. Engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation in between study sessions.
8. Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or counsellor about your feelings and struggles. They can offer valuable guidance and encouragement.
Remember, it’s okay to not feel okay. You can overcome this and find your motivation again. Take small steps towards your goals, and be patient with yourself.

I have been attending sessions with my counsellor since my father passed away. I am a person who values relationships a lot in my life, regardless if it’s family, partner, friends or work wise.
In our latest session, she asked me who I am as a person if one day I don’t have these relationships in my life, and that question just caused me to break down instantly cause I do not have an answer for it. My mind just went blank as I can’t describe myself.
All I can remember is that back in my childhood, I had difficulties creating relationships with family and people around me. Once I started to mature into 20s, I started to be able to create meaningful relationships and I am grateful for the few long lasting relation that I am in now.
I also realised I have a strong self blaming, self judge and critical of myself. Sometimes I even feel ashamed of myself or even to the point of hating myself and un-deserving of all good things that happened to me in life which really scares me.
If I am not a son, a husband, a friend or an employee, then who am I as a person? How can I find my self-identity?
*my counsellor is really a great counsellor so please don’t take this post as criticism of my counsellor.",,2,,,,,

No man is an island, you are a son, a husband, a friend and an employee. No one can take that away from you and that should be part of your identity too.
But beyond that I do kind of understand what your counsellor is trying to ask. Perhaps you could start off by finding out what you enjoy doing. For eg, someone who enjoys art may identify as an artist. Sometimes as we grow, we forget about these passions or hobbies that we had. I get a sense that may be what you’re feeling.
So what is it that you enjoy doing?",,2,,,,,

I’m sorry to hear about your father’s passing. Please accept my condolences.
I commend you for taking the initiative and having courage to seek therapy to help you process what you are going through. I believe the counsellor’s question has sparked a profound exploration of your self-identity. It’s wonderful that you’re taking the effort to get to know yourself at a deeper level.
I also think that your relationships have shaped your sense of self that has formed over the years till now. However, you want to explore who you are beyond those roles. May I suggest you reflect on:
2. Values: What matters most to you in life? (e.g., kindness, honesty, creativity)
3. Interests: What activities bring you joy and make you feel alive?
4. Personality traits: What are your strengths and weaknesses? (e.g., empathetic, determined, perfectionistic)
5. Passions: What topics do you find yourself reading about or exploring in your free time?
6. Self-care: How do you nurture and take care of yourself?
7. Goals: What aspirations do you have for personal growth and development?
8. Spirituality: What gives your life meaning and purpose?
Reflecting on these aspects can help you discover your core identity. Remember, self-identity is not static; it evolves as you grow and learn.
Regarding self-blame, self-judgment, and self-criticism, consider:
2. Practising self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend.
3. Challenging negative thoughts: When you notice self-criticism, reframe those thoughts into more balanced and realistic ones.
4. Focusing on self-awareness: Recognize your strengths and accomplishments, and celebrate them!
You are more than your relationships. You are a unique individual with a rich inner world. Embrace this journey of self-discovery, and remember that your counsellor is there to support you along the way.",,1,,,,,

I am a 31F working a normal 9 to 6 job with a relatively low-average pay depending how you look at it.
My mother is the one causing issues for me (65F) as she is unemployed/retired from her previously very demanding job. Recently as a person who is widowed at her age (she has been widowed for a very long time) and currently perhaps feeling lonely, she has been the target of scammers and she has been approached and scammed of a 4-figure sum by said scammer. However, ignoring all advice from myself, her sister, the police (after she made a report) and also the bank (after changing all her banking details) , she is still in consistent contact with said scammer. I fail to understand why and am deeply disappointed, as I was under the impression that her recent motivation to get fit and healthy despite being home mostly was a great change, but that changed as soon as I came to realize that she was trying to impress the (foreigner) mystery man.
I’ve tried to suggest things like, adopt a new hobby, perhaps attend a class (I offered to fund these as long as she indicated interest, we could discuss), participate in local community activities, visit her own elderly mother and participate in elderly care, etc. but she did not budge and flatly turned me down at every turn.
The next best measure me and her sibling could come up with was that I was allowed access into her banking account so that I could monitor her transactions so that such large amounts would not go undetected. But the date the bank has set is quite far from now, and she has not been honest about her ongoings since I’ve displayed frustration and resistance whenever she engaged with her internet ‘friends’. I’ve reason to suspect they are all scammers, as on occasion I’ve glanced at her messages while passing by and they seem to profess their love despite never having met.
I’m extremely disappointed and have a lot on my plate due to a manpower crunch at work, so I can only do so much for her. It drives me down a deep dark hole mentally when I’m feeling at such a loss of what to do for her and it makes me feel like I’ve failed in my duty to her as her child. I’ve also lost appetite and am less socially engaged lately because this weighs down on my mind 24/7, as well as losing sleep.
What am I supposed to do? I really don’t know. Apologies as this is a long post as my thoughts are all over the place.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now, and it’s completely understandable to feel stressed and cornered. You’re trying so hard to protect your mom and juggle your own responsibilities, and it must be incredibly overwhelming.
It’s extremely upsetting to witness someone you care about suffer harm at the hands of con artists, especially when they disobey advice from those around them. It’s natural to feel disappointed and frustrated, especially when your efforts to help seem to fall on deaf ears. Your concern for your mom’s well-being shows how much you care about her, and it’s clear you’re doing everything you can to support her.
I can imagine how disheartening it must be when your suggestions for new hobbies or activities are turned down. It’s frustrating to feel like you’re running out of options to keep her engaged and safe. It’s good that you and her sibling are taking steps to monitor her banking transactions, even though the process is taking longer than you’d like.
It sounds like this situation is taking a toll on your mental and physical health. Losing sleep, appetite, and feeling socially withdrawn are clear signs of how much this is affecting you. It’s important to acknowledge that you’re doing your best under very challenging circumstances. Recognize that doing your best may not immediately change your mother’s situation, but your efforts are significant and valuable.
Feeling helpless when your actions don’t seem to make a difference can be incredibly tough. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this. Your entire family is also stepping in to help mitigate the worst outcomes. Everyone is doing their part, and while it may feel like there’s little progress, these collective efforts are crucial.
In situations like these, it’s about preparing for the worst while hoping for the best. Short of taking drastic measures, which could create other problems, the best approach is to continue being supportive and vigilant. Being prepared for the worst means having plans in place to protect your mother as much as possible, even if she continues to resist your efforts.
In case that you may feel unsure if your preparations are adequate, here are a few things that might help:
- Reach Out for Support: Consider talking to a counselor or joining a support group for caregivers or people dealing with similar issues. Sometimes sharing your experiences with others who understand can provide emotional relief.
- Self-Care: Try to carve out some time for yourself, even if it’s just a few minutes a day. Activities like taking a walk, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy can help reduce stress.
- Clear Communication: Keep the lines of communication open with your mom, even if it’s tough. Let her know you’re there for her and express your concerns without judgment. Sometimes gentle persistence can make a difference.
- Professional Advice: You might consider seeking advice from a professional who specializes in elder care or dealing with scams targeting the elderly. They might have additional strategies or resources to help protect your mom.
- Community Resources: Look into local community resources that might offer activities or social groups for your mom. Sometimes having a variety of options can make it easier to find something she’s interested in.
- Contact the Bank: Reach out to the bank’s fraud department to report the scam and seek assistance. They can help monitor the account, potentially reverse fraudulent transactions, and enhance account security. While waiting for formal access, request immediate alerts from the bank for any large or unusual transactions to provide more immediate oversight.
- Legal Protections: Consider obtaining a financial power of attorney or consulting a probono lawyer specializing in elder law to explore options for legal protections.
- Professional Intervention: Encourage your mom to see a therapist or counselor who specializes in elder issues and internet safety. Contact organizations that specialize in elder abuse and fraud prevention for additional resources and support.
- Community and Social Support: Engage local senior centers or community organizations that offer activities and social engagement for seniors. These can provide structured and safe environments for your mom.
- Scam Awareness Programs: Enroll your mom in programs that educate seniors about common scams and how to protect themselves. Sometimes hearing it from an authority can be more impactful.
- Regular Family Meetings: Hold regular family meetings to discuss ongoing concerns and ensure everyone is informed and involved in supporting your mom.
Remember, you’re doing everything you can, and it’s okay to seek help and support for yourself as well. Taking care of your own well-being is crucial in being able to continue supporting her. You’re not failing your mom. You’re doing your best in a very difficult situation, and that’s all anyone can ask of you.
You’re not alone in this, we’re here to support you, and there are people out there who care and want to help you through this challenging time.
Take care.",,1,,,,,

Thanks for sharing your journey. I can hear that you’ve been dealing with a lot, and it’s very courageous of you to reach out. Let’s unpack what’s going on and see how we can navigate this together.
Just making sure that I understood where you are coming from,
You’ve spent a long time away from school dealing with personal issues and doing a lot of introspection. Realizing that complacency has been a significant issue is a powerful insight, and when you compare it to laziness, it seems that you compelled to reprimand yourself and not see it as an opportunity for growth once acknowledged.
It is emotionally taxing and perplexing to feel hurt by the cycle of high praise and harsh criticism. Struggling to define and understand deep-seated feelings, along with the fear and uncertainty about whether our current actions are beneficial, is natural during self-discovery. And it makes unable to recognize our achievements and learning from feedback can help balance these feelings.
Feeling like you’ve let down people who believed in your potential can be a heavy burden. Personal growth and success aren’t linear. Everyone has setbacks and moments of self-doubt.
Your mixed feelings of fear, confusion, and excitement about the future are completely normal. It’s okay to feel torn and unsure about your next steps as you have indicated how you should respond and move forward from these moments.
You appear to have done a lot actually, so there is only one suggestion that might help:
Be kind to yourself. … Recognize that you’re doing your best and that mistakes and setbacks are part of the learning process.
@IcecreamWaffle, If I may ask, can I get a clearer picture of how these feelings and reflections are impacting you, could you share a bit more about your daily experiences? Here are a few questions that might help us understand better:
- Have these thoughts and feelings made it difficult for you to manage your daily activities? For example, are they affecting your sleep, appetite, or ability to focus?
- Do you find that these reflections make it harder for you to make decisions or take action? Do you feel stuck or paralyzed when trying to move forward with your plans or goals?
- Have you noticed significant distress or impairment in areas of your life because of these concerns? For instance, is your emotional turmoil interfering with your relationships, schoolwork, or other important aspects of your life?
We are concerned for your mental health and well-being, your insights on these questions can help us determine how advices from the community can help you as well… Understanding this can guide us in finding the right support and strategies for you.
You’re not alone in this journey, and it’s great to hear that you are seeking help here. Remember, personal growth is a continuous process, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time. We’re here to support you every step of the way.
Take care, and keep moving forward. You’ve got this!",,2,,,,,

- Feels as though I have been caught in a whirlwind of unbridled thoughts. Despite me not forcing upon it, they just shift my mind away and makes me exhausted from everything else. Starting when I realized something was wrong till now, my mental and physical well-being as definitely taken a toll. Somehow it just halted and derailed most previous activities I previously enjoyed doing.
- I collect my thoughts on my google notes, every few times a day opening a new note and jotting whatever pops in my mind. Sometimes I let it sit but it clouds my mind to the point where I feel the day feels left with 4 hours than 24hours.
- Since then I’ve been less outgoing and closed off in which made me lose many friends that perhaps realized i was no longer who i was prior. During this period there were also major dips in my academics. I volunteer a whole bunch but since this, I’ve thought to myself if I can’t help myself, I am not in the right position to help others. Carrying this thought made me drop out of many things I was involved in.

I should thank you! In fact, you are very thoughtful, and I really appreciate your openness and the insights you’ve shared. After going through a whirlwind, it’s no wonder you’re feeling exhausted.
From what you’ve described, it’s clear that these thoughts have significantly impacted your mental and physical well-being. It’s important to recognize how much this has derailed activities you previously enjoyed and affected your daily life. The fact that you jot down your thoughts in Google notes shows a proactive approach to managing your mental state, even if it feels overwhelming at times.
Your mention of becoming less outgoing and losing friends highlights how these struggles have affected your social life. It’s tough when we feel like we’re no longer the person we used to be, and I can see how that would make you withdraw from social activities and volunteering. It’s understandable to feel like you need to help yourself before you can help others.
I also see a spark of excitement and gratitude in your journey, despite the external pressures. It’s wonderful that you view this period as a chance to grow now rather than facing these issues later in life. Your shift from trying to meet expectations to focusing on self-growth is a positive and healthy mindset.
It’s great to hear that you’re able to assess yourself and see the bigger picture of your strengths and weaknesses. Recognizing complacency as a core issue is a significant step forward. Complacency, as you described, can lead to a lack of motivation, but acknowledging it means you’re aware of it and already on the path to overcoming it. In fact, may I share a different perspective to this? I see complacency as a holding space for you to take a break from all the hurt and disappointment that you have felt.
Let’s continue to build on this self-awareness and work towards your goals. Here are a few more steps that will help us get back on track:
1. Reflect on Your Accomplishments: Keep noting down your achievements and reflecting on them regularly. This can boost your confidence and help you see the progress you’re making.
2. Set for Yourself Small, Achievable Goals: Break down your goals into smaller steps to make them more manageable. This can help you feel less overwhelmed and more in control.
3. Continue to Seek Support: Consider talking to a counselor or mentor who can provide guidance and support. Sometimes, having someone to talk to can make a big difference.
4. Remember to Practice Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself and recognize that you’re doing your best. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the learning process.
5. Continue to reconnect: with friends or family members you trust. Having a support network can help you feel less isolated and more supported.
While the future can seem uncertain, that doesn’t mean the uncertainty of the future should detract from our ability to believe in ourselves and our actions. Every small step we take daily is a step towards faith in ourselves. Embracing this mindset can help us build resilience and maintain motivation, which is a strength that we call our own and that is our credit, not luck.

hello! the situation is rather subpar at the moment… two days ago i just got discharged from imh (feel free to judge) and im still kind of readjusting from what felt like prison today i saw my therapist and in a terrible turn of events she feels there is nothing more she can do with me and would like us to pause our sessions and wants me to go for family counselling instead (which the imh care team recommended too)… she feels unless family counselling goes well there is nothing for her to do and we will Not be meeting again… while i understand this has been a massive shock to me because my therapist is like the Only person i can talk to and my only source of comfort or support i also feel like i can never see her again because i have little to no hope for family counselling… my parents have put in zero effort whatsoever unless they can throw money at my problems and i do not see them trying or changing at all… im sick and tired of getting my hopes up just to be disappointed over and over again and i dont want to be the only one putting in the effort all the time… im 19 and im a student so im not financially stable either. i feel so alone and abandoned and its bringing back the suicidal thoughts and urges that left me hospitalised for a week in the first place. the last thing i want is to end up back there right after i got discharged and endure the judgement of all the nurses my only thought is that i should have killed myself the firt time i wanted to and i feel like all the effort ive put in wasnt worth it… i am so lost and confused and alone what do i do

Thank you for choosing to share your story with us here on let’s talk. It sounds incredibly tough, and I’m glad you reached out to share your feelings.
I’m sorry to hear that your experience in IMH was very much less than ideal, it never feels good to be judged. I hear your struggle that you feel your suicidal thoughts rising again due to your therapist saying that she is putting a pause on your sessions, it definitely can feel overwhelming especially when you feel that your main support is taken away.
I hear that you have no hope in family counselling due to your family’s lack of support. However I just want to encourage you to not give up completely, even though things may seem really bleak at the moment, sometimes family therapy may open new channels of communication, maybe they just need an external person to nudge them to change.
However in the meantime, maybe it’ll be good to find other sources of support such as friends, support groups etc.
Frankly speaking, I am quite shock that your therapist would just leave you hanging like that, individual therapy can complement/ go-along side with family therapy.
Based on your financial situation, you can look at places offering pro bono/ subsided counselling like Care Corner (Mental Health for Youth (INSIGHT) - Care Corner Singapore l ) or Limitless (Get Help: Talk to Someone — Limitless )
I just want you to know that you are important, we may not know each other but know that the community here at let’s talk cares about you and want to see you thrive. You’re never alone!

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your feelings. I can hear how much pain and frustration you’re experiencing right now.
You’ve just been discharged from IMH and are feeling like you’re readjusting from what felt like prison. The sudden change in your therapy situation has been a massive shock. Your therapist, who has been your only source of comfort, suggested pausing individual sessions in favor of family counseling. I understand how abandoned you feel by this decision because you don’t have much hope for family counseling due to your parents’ lack of effort and emotional involvement. You’re tired of being the only one putting in effort and don’t want to be disappointed again.
At 19, as a student, you’re facing financial instability and feelings of loneliness and abandonment. This situation has triggered suicidal thoughts and urges, which you’re trying to manage. Despite everything, you’ve shown incredible strengths. You’re very aware of your emotions and the dynamics in your family and therapy. You’ve continued to engage in therapy and are reaching out for help now. You’re openly sharing your thoughts and feelings, which is a crucial step in seeking support. Despite setbacks, you’ve taken steps to improve your mental health in the past.
Your feelings of being lost, confused, and alone are completely valid. It’s essential to address the resurfacing suicidal thoughts. Please reach out to a crisis hotline or a trusted person in your life right away. Here are some resources you can contact:
- Samaritans of Singapore (SOS): 24-hour Hotline: 1800-221-4444
- Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) Helpline: 1800-283-7019
- CHAT (Community Health Assessment Team): Phone: 6493-6500 / 6493-6501
While it’s daunting given your past experiences, family counseling could provide a new perspective and support. It’s worth discussing your concerns openly with the family counselor to see if there’s a way to address these dynamics. If you feel your current therapist isn’t meeting your needs, consider reaching out to another therapist or counselor. Sometimes, finding the right support can make a big difference.
Reflecting on your strengths can help you navigate this challenging time. You’ve shown incredible resilience and strength. You’ve taken steps to seek help and improve your situation, which is commendable. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and relief. Whether it’s a hobby, talking to a friend, or simply taking a walk, small actions can sometimes help manage overwhelming feelings.
You’re not alone in this, and we care about your well-being. It’s okay to take one step at a time and seek the support you need. Please continue to share your thoughts and feelings as much as you feel comfortable. We’re here to listen and support you through this.

14173,Is it considered cheating? How do I move forward from here?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/is-it-considered-cheating-how-do-i-move-forward-from-here/14173,Seeking Help,"needadvice, anxiety, letstalkaboutit",11590,manda2,User,,21859,1,"Hi. I need some advice…. I recently found a secret chat on my partner’s telegram and the content of it was…. Sext. It was a secret chat with a lady meant to disappear after awhile and there were 2 unread msges, one of which was a picture of the lady teasing with one of her body part. I was shivering when I saw it and I cried uncontrollably. After awhile, I confronted my partner and while he initially played dumb, he came clean as soon as I shove his phone to his face and asked him to check his telegram. I was shaking because I didn’t expect this at all, I didn’t even think he was capable of doing this to me nor behind my back.
I decided to give him a chance to explain himself. He asked first if I can bring myself to believe him. I just kept quiet. He continued on by assuring me that he is not having an affair with anyone and isnt sleeping around. The lady that he was sexting with, they have never met nor do they know how each other looks like. But yes ultimately, he admitted to the sexting. Long story short, we haven’t been doing the deed as often as before especially not after having a child but he has high libido and at the same time, he mentioned that he often sympathise with me as I’m always exhausted so he don’t have the heart to tempt me at all or temp me any further to do the deed together. As a result, he resort to ■■■■■■■■■■■■ via ■■■■ or this occasional sext (his words) with the same lady. Sometimes, his high libido is stress-induced so the above would happen too esp if it’s late at night and I’m asleep.
I immediately felt at fault because yes it’s true, most of the time I do reject his attempts at doing the deed but part of me is also thinking, is it really my fault that this happened? So in that case, did he cheat on me? I feel like I’ve been cheated on although to him it is just sext. We are married, with a child. I do not want to see this marriage end but I need someone to break this down for me and help me navigate through this because I’m at a loss on what to do etc and this isn’t something that I can openly share to friends or family. Is this cheating? Is it my fault? I am so paranoid now, I would at times wait for him to fall asleep at night so that I know he won’t do any “night activitiy”.
Help me please",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through. It sounds incredibly painful and confusing, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way. Let’s talk through this together.
Finding out about the secret chat must have been a huge shock. It’s natural to feel betrayed and hurt when you discover something like this. Your emotions are valid, and it’s important to acknowledge how deeply this has affected you. It’s okay to cry and feel overwhelmed.
When you confronted your partner, it’s understandable that you were shaking and felt a mix of emotions. It’s a lot to process. Your partner admitted to the sexting and explained his reasons, but that doesn’t necessarily make it easier to accept or understand.
It’s important to remember that while he might have reasons for his behavior, it doesn’t excuse the fact that it hurt you. You deserve to feel respected and secure in your relationship. Sexting, even if it’s not physical, can still feel like a betrayal because it breaks the trust and intimacy you share.
Feeling at fault for rejecting his attempts at intimacy is a heavy burden to carry. Relationships are complex, and intimacy issues are often multifaceted. It’s not fair to place all the blame on yourself. You’ve been dealing with exhaustion and the demands of having a child, which are significant factors that impact your energy and desire for intimacy. It’s not your fault that he chose to handle his needs in this way.
Wondering if this is cheating and if it’s your fault is natural in this situation. Cheating can be defined differently by different people, but it often comes down to a breach of trust and intimacy. If it feels like cheating to you, then it’s valid to consider it as such. Your feelings matter.
Lastly, it is very important to recognize that your feelings of paranoia are a natural response to the betrayal you’ve experienced. When trust is broken, it’s common to feel anxious and hypervigilant. These feelings are your mind’s way of trying to protect you from further hurt. Acknowledge that it’s okay to feel this way and that it doesn’t make you weak or irrational.
Here are some steps you might consider:
2. Sit down with your partner and discuss your feelings openly. Let him know how his actions have affected you and express your need for reassurance and transparency moving forward. Ask for regular check-ins where you can both talk about your feelings and any concerns you might have. This can help you feel more connected and reduce anxiety. Establish clear boundaries regarding what is and isn’t acceptable in your relationship. Both of you should agree on these boundaries and commit to respecting them. Discuss what transparency looks like for both of you. This might include sharing phone passwords or having open access to certain accounts, but only if both partners agree and it helps rebuild trust.
3. Seeking the help of a couples counselor can provide a safe space for both of you to discuss your feelings and work through the issues in your relationship. A professional can guide you in rebuilding trust and improving communication.
4. Be kind to yourself. It’s not your fault that this happened. Intimacy in a relationship can be challenging, especially with the demands of parenthood. Acknowledge your efforts and understand that it’s okay to have boundaries and needs. Engage in mindfulness practices such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. These techniques can help reduce anxiety and keep you grounded in the present moment. Try to focus on activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Engaging in hobbies or spending time with loved ones can provide a much-needed distraction and help ease your mind. Write down your thoughts and feelings. Journaling can be a therapeutic way to process your emotions and gain clarity. It can also help you track your progress over time.
5. Trust is rebuilt through consistent, trustworthy actions over time. Your partner needs to demonstrate reliability and honesty continuously. Pay attention to his behavior. Is he being more open and transparent? Is he making an effort to reassure you and respect your boundaries? While it might be tempting to constantly check your partner’s phone or social media, try to limit these behaviors as they can fuel paranoia. Instead, focus on building trust and open communication. Consider seeing a couples counselor who can help mediate these discussions and provide tools for rebuilding trust. A professional can offer guidance on how to navigate these difficult emotions and improve communication.
6. While you might not feel comfortable sharing this with friends or family, consider individual therapy to address your feelings of paranoia and anxiety. A therapist can provide personalized strategies to help you cope and work through your emotions.
Managing paranoia after a betrayal is a gradual process. It’s important to be patient with yourself and recognize that rebuilding trust takes time. By focusing on open communication, self-care, and seeking support, you can begin to address your feelings of paranoia and work towards healing your relationship. Your desire to maintain your marriage is important, and it’s possible to work through this with effort and support. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to seek help to navigate through this difficult time.

Thanks for sharing what you’re going through. Just hearing about the pressure, the assignments, and those tight deadlines stresses me out already! It really sounds overwhelming, and I can totally understand why you’re feeling the way you do. It’s important to know that it’s okay not to have it all together all the time.
Feeling irritated, emotional, and juggling sadness, anger, and anxiety all at once is a lot to handle. It sounds like you’re trying to keep it together on the outside, but inside it’s a different story. I get that. It’s really hard to keep pushing forward when you’re feeling so drained and demotivated. Sometimes, the sheer volume of what’s on your plate can make it hard to even start. The thought of tackling everything can feel paralyzing. It’s okay to feel resistant and lack motivation when you’re under this much pressure.
Maybe it would help to break things down a bit. When everything feels overwhelming, sometimes the best thing to do is take it one step at a time. Try focusing on one assignment or task for a short period, like 20-30 minutes. Give yourself permission to take a break after that. It might make the workload feel a bit more manageable.
Another thing that might help is to prioritize your assignments. What’s due the soonest? What’s the most important? Sometimes just making a list and seeing everything laid out can make it feel less chaotic.
Don’t forget to take care of yourself. It’s easy to neglect basic self-care when you’re stressed, but things like getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking short breaks can really make a difference. Even a few minutes of deep breathing or a quick walk can help clear your mind.
The biggest help that you have initiated for yourself is actually posting it here… allowing yourself to openly write here about what you’re going through. Whether it’s a stranger, friend, or counselor, sharing your feelings can provide some relief. Sometimes just knowing that someone else understands can make a big difference.
Remember, building resilience takes time. It’s about finding small ways to bounce back and take care of yourself, even when things are tough. You’ve already taken the first step by reaching out and acknowledging what’s going on. That’s a huge sign of strength.
You’re doing your best, and that’s what matters most. It’s okay to feel how you’re feeling, and it’s okay to ask for help. We’re all here to support you through this. Let’s take it one step at a time, and remember that you’re not alone in this.

Currently Im taking a difficult subject at a school. Its Full stack ( Software Engineer ) Or Coding. It’s been very highly stressful but i manage to cope.
However currently things are going that great financially. I have written an email to my MP and seeked help from organizations.
Im on unfit to work MC till Nov 1st. Im facing so much at the moment in my private life but i manage to just put it one side and try to focus on one task at a time.
I have been Diagnosed with Schizo Affective and I survived 3 attempts of suicide about 15 years ago. I find it hard to get employment when i do declare but when i dont and the employer finds out things turn sour and most of the time i get fired.
I have developed trust with my classmates and Teachers and trainers.
They see that i have a hard time but i feel compled to tell them the truth about me. On one hand the sales rep that sold me this course said that i shouldnt disclose to anyone . That it is in the past cause i have been very stable for the past 7 years. I do still take medication but i only see the doctors at IMH for 6-7 period at a time.
My issue is that on the outside i am composed but internally i have breakdowns. Thankfuly not to the point of suicidal anymore but still when i go thru the phase i do fall sick - Just recovered from a week of being sick.
Should i share this part with employers or people that have earn my trust or should i just keep it to myself ?

Thank you for sharing your story with us. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now, from your challenging studies in Full Stack Software Engineering to financial difficulties and managing your mental health. It’s impressive that despite all this, you’re focusing on one task at a time and managing to cope.
You’ve been through so much, and it’s clear that you have incredible resilience. Surviving three suicide attempts and maintaining stability for the past seven years is a testament to your strength. Your ongoing commitment to taking your medication and seeing your doctors regularly shows how dedicated you are to your mental health.
I understand the dilemma you’re facing about whether to disclose your mental health history. On one hand, you’ve built trust with your classmates, teachers, and trainers and feel compelled to be open with them. On the other hand, you’ve been advised to keep it to yourself due to potential negative repercussions, especially with employment. This is a difficult decision, and it’s completely normal to feel conflicted.
It’s important to consider both your well-being and the potential impact of disclosure. If you feel that sharing your story with those you trust will provide you with more support and understanding, it might be beneficial. However, it’s also important to protect yourself from potential negative consequences. Do you have a trusted counselor or therapist who can help you weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision?
Regarding employment, it’s a tough situation. Some employers are becoming more understanding and supportive of mental health issues, but not all are. You might want to consider seeking advice from a career counselor. You will need clarity about your support resources and network in the event if the employer does not understand or is not capable of providing the support that you need.
It’s encouraging to hear that you’re no longer experiencing suicidal thoughts. However, the internal breakdowns and recent illness due to stress are concerning. It’s crucial to continue seeking support and finding ways to manage your stress. Activities that bring you comfort and relief, such as hobbies, talking to friends, or taking walks, can be helpful. Remember, you don’t have to go through this alone. Reaching out to support networks, whether they are friends, family, or professionals, can make a big difference.
If you ever feel overwhelmed, please don’t hesitate to reach out to crisis hotlines or mental health professionals. Here are some resources you can contact:

Thank you for the much needed reply. I think my resilence came from my training in NS as a Guardsmen. Eventhough i hated those 2 years but i learned to endure so much and I took the lessons i learn with me for life.
I am just hoping that each challange will be over one step at a time. One lesson i wont forget is when i was expected to run 10km in under 50 min.
I failed 5 times before i finally passed. I had a buddy that ran with me and told me to focus on my legs and was like "" Left foot, now right foot, now left foot forward ""…One step at a time…
its true what they say… a journey of a thousand step starts with one.
I will talk to my therapist and ask his opinion on this if i should share and reveal. For now i will do what ever i can in my power to live life to the best of my abilities. I know first hand that it is very hard to focus when the mind and the situation seems like its attacking from every angle but what i do know is that to take one step at a time and focus on the task at hand.
I do not know if the people reading this will benefit. But yeah, there will come a time when you do question if you should share certain thing with the people that you have build trust with and i had my share of people looking down on me and seeing me of less than a person and honestly in my opinion - I do not need these people anyways.
Okay then,
thanks again.

I am a gay male in my mid 20s, of a minority race. Being gay in itself is hard in this society. Being a minority race within the already marginalized community makes it worse. If you’re not conventionally attractive then you aren’t really accepted by many in the gay community. And race plays a part. It also doesn’t help that my family knows of my sexuality and do not support me.
I also struggle with social skills and self-esteem. My social skills not crippling, but being an introvert doesn’t help with making new friends or finding a partner. I am not witty or funny or fun to be with in general.
I’ve always tried to accept the idea that I will inevitably be lonely.
I’ve tried to convince myself that I don’t need anyone else in my life.
I’ve also tried convincing myself that I am worthy to be loved and be attracted to.
But, just a few days ago, I started watching the new Netflix series called ‘The Boyfriend.’ It is a same-sex dating reality-tv show based in Japan and everything that I’ve suppressed for many months hit me like a truck ever since.
The series showcase men that I think are conventionally attractive living together for a month and finding love. And I hated knowing that I would never be able to find what they have. The looks, the charisma, the social skills, the relationships. It made me start thinking about all of my insecurities and the things that I could only imagine. It also made me start thinking about my past traumatic experiences again (like childhood domestic physical and emotional abuse) and made me feel extremely upset and envious towards others (like the cast of the series) on why I’ve always been given the short end of the stick.
Because of this, I haven’t been able to sleep much for the past few days. I’ve been doing more things to distract myself but it isn’t working and I’m afraid of crashing.
It’s probably stupid that I’m letting a “reality-tv” affect me but this is beyond that. It triggered a whole wave of emotions I’ve tried hiding. So simply removing that TV-show out of my life or keeping a distance from social media wouldn’t help me at all.
I have worked on physical self-improvement in the past. I worked very hard previously in losing body fat and working out to build muscles to be more attractive. It boosted my self-confidence a bit but that’s about it. It didn’t really improve anything else and I eventually burnt out.
This episode has by far been the worst for me emotionally. I have had suicidal thoughts in the past but this time it was intense. Almost felt numb to the idea of killing myself.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your story. It takes a lot of courage to be so vulnerable and honest.
Firstly, please know that you are not alone in this struggle. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed by societal pressures, family expectations, and personal insecurities.
It’s important to note that your worth and identity extend beyond your physical appearance, social skills, and relationships. You are more than enough, regardless of your background or circumstances. Please take heart and remain hopeful and optimistic.
I encourage you to write down your goals and aspirations in all areas of your life. Take stock of how far you have come, what you have achieved, what you have triumphed over despite the challenges you faced since young. Life is multidimensional so plan and take steps to achieve holistic development.
Your struggles with social skills, self-esteem, and trauma are valid. I encourage you to continue to seek growth. One avenue is to consider getting professional help from a counsellor who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space where you can feel better understood and achieve clarity. The professional can help you identify and process what you are facing to make more sense of it.
Regarding the TV show, I sense that you already know that reality TV often presents an edited and curated version of reality. As you wisely wrote, it’s therefore not helpful to compare your life to a manufactured narrative.
Remember, you are worthy of love, acceptance, and support. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to resources like:
- Mental health professionals
- Crisis helplines such as 995 or 1767 (SOS 24 hour hotline)
You are strong and determined, and you can get through this. Your story matters, and your experiences are valuable. Please take slow but firm steps to work towards achieving better mental health, acceptance and your aspirations. Keep at it – you are 100% deserving of love, care, and happiness.",,0,,,,,
14087,Struggling with relationship,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/struggling-with-relationship/14087,Seeking Help,---,11361,user1208,User,,21699,1,I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for around 7 months and the relationship has started to fall apart. We have been having multiple talks about breaking up this past week due to differing interests and goals in life. We had this talk about 4 months into the relationship but we had concluded to try and improve ourselves to see if it would work. For me it was my pickiness in eating and lack of willingness to try new things which i have started to improve on and am actually alot more adventourous with my food now. Whereas on his end he improved on his communication skills especially when we argue as he tends to shutdown and invalidate my feelings and there have been some improvement in that aspect as i feel like i can communicate more with him. But things just suddenly changed when he said that he doesnt know if he would be happier single and that he does not see a future with me. his reasoning was that he wants to do alot of things in life like skydiving/ travelling the world which he feels im not capable of due to physical capabilities and im just not super adventourous. Moreover he says that he wants kids in the future but im not very keen on it because i dont know if he can be a great dad and if i can be a great mom. and im still young(im 20 he is 23 and we are still both in uni) so i feel like making such big decisions at this age is very hard because our own futures are uncertain. Thus this has led to the series of talks about us breaking up and i also suffer from relationship anxiety too which ive been trying to seek help in but now im on the fence if i want to even try and make it work or just give up. Because i feel like if i give up ill have regrets because i havent tried enough since i havent like tried more adventur stuff like hiking/ snorkelling and i just feel like its so unfair when he never gave me the chance to show that i am capable or at least willing to do those things before he concluded there is no future. but im also afraid of staying because there is no gurantee that if i stay and try that it would be enough or that it can save the relationship and ill only get more hurt in the end. right now we have concluded to stay but the doubts are still haunting me and i just feel so sad and empty i really dont know what to do,,1,,,,,

Thank you for opening up about what you’re going through. It sounds like you’re facing a really tough situation with your relationship, and your confusion and doubt are completely understandable. Let’s break down what you’ve shared:
Uncertainty and Pressure:
- You’ve been in a relationship for 7 months, and it’s started to fall apart. You’ve had multiple talks about breaking up because of differing interests and goals.
- Your boyfriend recently said he’s not sure if he’d be happier single and doesn’t see a future with you. This has understandably created a lot of uncertainty.
- Making big decisions about the future feels especially hard because you’re both young and still in university.
Anxiety and Fear:
- You’re experiencing relationship anxiety and have been trying to seek help for it.
- The ongoing talks about breaking up have made your anxiety worse and left you unsure whether to keep trying or to end things.
- You’re feeling overwhelmed with the pressure to make such a big decision right now.
Regrets and Fairness:
- You’re afraid that if you give up, you’ll have regrets because you haven’t tried enough, like with adventurous activities.
- You feel it’s unfair that your boyfriend didn’t give you a chance to show you’re capable of being adventurous before concluding there’s no future.
- You’re also scared that staying might not be enough to save the relationship and that you’ll end up more hurt in the end.
- All of this has left you feeling sad and empty, and you really don’t know what to do.
First off, I want to say how impressive it is that you’ve been working hard to improve yourself. Here are some of the strengths you’ve shown:
2. Self-Awareness and Willingness to Improve: You’ve recognized areas you wanted to change, like being more adventurous with food, and you’ve actually made progress. That’s huge!
3. Effort in Communication: You’ve worked on improving communication with your boyfriend, and you’ve seen improvements on his end too. That effort is really commendable.
4. Seeking Help for Anxiety: You’ve been proactive in seeking help for your relationship anxiety, which shows a strong commitment to your mental well-being.
5. Reflective Thinking: Your ability to deeply reflect on your relationship, your goals, and your future is a sign of maturity and thoughtfulness.
- Self-Awareness: This will help you figure out what truly matters to you in a relationship and in life. It’s a great tool for personal growth.
- Willingness to Improve: This strength will help you adapt and grow in various areas of your life, making you more resilient.
- Effort in Communication: Good communication skills are essential in all areas of life. They can help you build strong, healthy relationships.
- Seeking Help: Your proactive approach to seeking help shows your dedication to self-care. This will serve you well as you navigate future challenges.
I wasn’t sure if you had the opportunity to seek counseling, perhaps you can consider it, as, in my opinion, it can be really valuable as you navigate the complexities of adult life:
- Understanding Doubts and Fears: A counselor can help you explore and understand your doubts and fears, giving you clarity.
- Developing Coping Strategies: Counseling can equip you with effective strategies to manage anxiety and stress.
- Improving Relationships: You can learn more about healthy relationship dynamics and how to foster mutual respect and understanding.
- Setting Goals: Counseling can help you set and achieve personal and professional goals.
- Building Confidence: Counseling can help you build confidence in your ability to handle life’s challenges.
It’s really important to acknowledge and validate your feelings – they’re completely natural given what you’re going through. You’ve both put in a lot of effort, but it makes sense that fear and uncertainty are overwhelming you.
Reflecting on what you truly want and need in a relationship might be helpful. Are these differences something you can work through together, or are they fundamental differences that might lead to ongoing conflict?
Managing your relationship anxiety is crucial. Have you considered seeking counseling specifically to explore your doubts and fears? A counselor can provide a space to understand these doubts and how they impact your decision-making.
It’s okay to take your time to think things through. You don’t need to rush a decision. Your well-being is important, and taking care of yourself is a priority. Please continue to share your thoughts and feelings as much as you feel comfortable. You’re not alone in this, and there are people here to support you.
Let me know if it helps? Take care…

I feel you, this is the same conversation I’ve had with my partner as well. She’s also not super adventurous whereas I had wilder dreams of traveling the world etc. I think it goes down to how open he is to accepting your ideas of a fun and healthy relationship. You’ve said a lot about what future he wants but what about you? Is he open to the future you want to?
On the topic of kids, that’s probably a dealbreaker for me. It’s hard to change anyone’s world view and if he wants kids and you don’t want - it might be hard for either of you to give in.

Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to grieve the loss of the relationship and the future you had hoped for. I, too, would be feeling lost and unsure of what to do next.
Relationships can be incredibly complex, and sometimes people say things that are hard to understand. It sounds like your partner’s statement has left you questioning the meaning of love and their true feelings. Love can mean different things to different people, and sometimes, people can be confused or conflicted about their own feelings. It’s okay to feel confused and to question everything right now.
It’s important to give yourself the space to feel all the emotions that come with conflicts. It is a process, where you will feel sad, angry, confused, or even getting tensed up. These feelings are important and valid for you, as a first step, to know that you need to unwind from the tension.
Distancing from someone you love is incredibly hard, but remember that it’s okay to take things one step at a time. Give yourself some quality time alone and permission to take small steps towards healing. You don’t have to have everything figured out right now and it’s okay to reach out for support whenever you need it.
Finding motivation can be really hard when you’re feeling so down. Try to take small steps each day. Focus on basic self-care like eating well, getting enough sleep, and engaging in activities that usually bring you joy or comfort, even if it’s just a little bit.
I hope this helps a bit. You’re going through a lot, and it’s important to be gentle with yourself during this time. If you want to talk more about what you’re going through, everyone is here for you.

3584,Health Anxiety,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/health-anxiety/3584,Is This Normal?,---,1383,Jane,Professional,Professional,4640,2,"Hi @anonymous21, thank you for writing in! I’m sorry to hear that you are experiencing these symptoms. I can imagine that it would be frustrating to go through this yet not have a proper explanation for it.
The thing with health anxiety is that it can be tricky to recognize. It happens when there is a preoccupation or excessive worry about developing a serious illness. The nature of anxiety itself can cause physical symptoms like the ones you mentioned, and those with health anxiety might mistake such symptoms for physical illness. With that said, I am unable to confirm if this is the case for you as I cannot provide professional diagnosis. Instead, I would encourage that you speak with a psychologist or psychiatrist if you would like to have a formal evaluation for it.
Alternatively, if these symptoms are typically lasting for anywhere between 20min to an hour, it might just be a stress response called “fight or flight”, which can happen as a reaction to a stressful or frightening event, or due to excessive mental stress (e.g. thinking about a stressful situation). Assuming this to be the case, it might be worth figuring out what is causing the excessive stress so you can better manage the situation. Perhaps you have a deadline coming up and you feel underprepared for it; could you be going through a transitional period like moving or switching jobs; or perhaps you simply have too much on your plate and it is causing you to feel overwhelmed? It might also help to take note of when these symptoms occur (e.g. before/after a specific event or thinking about a situation) and their duration.
Whichever the case may be, taking better care of your physical health and lowering your stress levels can be a good starting point in alleviating your symptoms. Caring for physical health (e.g. by getting quality sleep, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise) has been shown to boost mental wellbeing and increases our capacity to cope with daily stress. To lower stress levels, you could try relaxing hobbies such as journaling, coloring, doing puzzles, or even meditation. You may wish to try the tools listed here to help with this:

The psychiatrist just said I that it was because of the covid I had prior, which had caused to have difficulties breathing, and my mind and body was still somewhat living in that past. However, after that session, everything got worse. I had panic attacks every single day for 2 weeks. And after that stopped, I had a usual common cold, but this made me freak out because I was worrying that my lungs had issues due to the phlegm and blocked nose. Soon after I recovered, I felt like all the progress I have made on my physical symptoms went to waste. Because I had developed new symptoms that I have no idea how to cope with. First, it started off with a a tingling burning sensation at my legs that has lasted continuously for 3 weeks. Next, I have sudden sharp pains that went down the left side of my back. This also occurs at the left side of my neck. I also have migraines and facial pains at the left side of my head. I also get chest pains, tremors and tightness, all at my left side. Additionally, I haven’t been able to swallow. It feels as if I’m being choked or I have forgotten how to swallow. I’ve tried a lot of things to work on my “anxiety” by doing breathing techniques, exercising regularly, managing my sleep schedule, eating well, but nothing seems to be working and my symptoms seem to be getting worse and this makes me feel as if I have a serious illness and I’m fighting the urge to visit the emergency department. Moreover, I became very afraid of getting sick. Things that did not bother last time freak me out now. I have a tendency to keep washing my hands, because I was scared of any surface I touch having germs. I also became scared of using soap. For example, I have a tiny cut on my hand, and I would just overthink that the soap would go into my wound and poison me. Theres many more things that happened but I can’t remember much. I seen some videos that suggest to resist going to doctor’s because reassurance will not help me. I don’t wish to end up in an endless loop, but what if its really more than physical “anxiety” symptoms? What should I do?",,1,,,,,
3584,Health Anxiety,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/health-anxiety/3584,Is This Normal?,---,3690,cottonsoul,Professional,Professional,6874,11,"Hi @anonymous47 ,
I’m truly sorry to hear that you’ve been going through such a difficult and distressing time, and I appreciate your trust in seeking advice. I’m proud of you for coming back here to seek support, it’s good to have you back. I also want to affirm you that your experiences and feelings are valid, and it’s understandable that you’re concerned about your physical symptoms.
Firstly, we are all so proud of you for being proactive in seeking help, and it’s good that you consulted with a psychiatrist in June. It’s actually common for physical symptoms to manifest as a result of anxiety or stress, and it’s good that you received an explanation for some of your symptoms related to your previous COVID experience.
However, I can see that your symptoms have escalated and are causing you significant distress. While I can’t diagnose or assess on this platform, but I can share with you that sometimes our stress and anxiety can lead to physical sensations and symptoms, often referred to as somatic symptoms. These symptoms can be very real and intense, but they are often related to heightened anxiety levels. The mind-body connection is powerful, and emotional distress can manifest physically.
The panic attacks, tingling sensations, sharp pains, migraines, chest pains, and difficulties swallowing are all symptoms that individuals with anxiety can experience. Given your current state, it might be beneficial to seek a second opinion from a medical professional, particularly if your physical symptoms persist or worsen. You could consult with your primary care physician to rule out any other underlying medical conditions. They can also provide guidance on how to manage these physical symptoms.
In parallel, it’s essential to address the anxiety and distress you’re experiencing. Seeking therapy from a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or therapist, can be incredibly valuable in helping you cope with and manage anxiety and the associated physical symptoms. Therapy can teach you effective coping strategies, relaxation techniques, and provide a safe space to explore the underlying causes of your anxiety.
For the time being, I would recommend you trying out these activities to help you in moments when you feel overwhelmed:

I want to affirm you again that seeking help for your anxiety is not about seeking reassurance; it’s about developing a deeper understanding of your emotional experiences and building resilience to manage them effectively. Indeed, when you have the right support, you can work towards finding relief from both the physical and emotional symptoms you’re facing.

Few weeks back, I had a random panic attack on my birthday while I was eating cake. My doc said could be due to stress or perimenopause. FYI, I actually left a job 1 month before the attack due to stress level.
After that one attack, I started having symptoms related to perimenopause(uti, joint pain, etc) and other symptoms which I do not know if it’s related to perimenopause or not (dry throat, dry mouth, tightening of throat which cause difficulty swallowing of food).
Recently my swallowing gets worst. When I want to swallow food, my throat will tighten, so I have to drink water to swallow food for every meal. And my meal can take more than 1 hr to eat and i still cannot finish the whole plate. So I can get hungry fast. It can be tiring spending so much time to eat. Swallowing suddenly become a difficult task for me.
Because of these issues, I have been going for walks, doing deep breathing exercises,listen to music, ie try to relax and not get worried or angry of stuff. But I am in low mood because of my swallowing issues. Lowest point in my life so far.
I have a ENT appointment but it’s only in sep.

Thank you for reaching out to share your pain and challenges with us. I’m truly sorry to hear about what you’re going through. It must be incredibly uncomfortable and distressing to experience such challenges, especially with their impact on your mood and daily life.
While I haven’t personally experienced this, I hope someone in the community can offer more insight into managing and recovering from it.
What I can share is that our emotions can manifest in physical symptoms like somatic pain. It can be valuable to explore both the physical sensations and the emotional aspects that may be contributing to your symptoms. This holistic approach can often provide a clearer understanding and guide towards effective management and healing.
Given the sudden onset of symptoms after a panic attack and considering your doctor’s suggestion of stress or perimenopause as potential factors, it may also be worthwhile to consider the somatic (body-oriented) aspects alongside relaxation techniques. Here are some insights and suggestions that might be helpful:
2. Understanding Somatic Symptoms: Somatic symptoms like difficulty swallowing can sometimes manifest as a result of emotional distress or unresolved stress. The body’s response to stress can sometimes lead to physical symptoms, and these can be exacerbated when emotions are not fully acknowledged or processed.
3. Holistic Approaches: Besides relaxation techniques such as walks and deep breathing exercises, it’s helpful to consider how your emotions and stress impact your physical health. Therapy can be beneficial for releasing stored tension in your body by addressing underlying emotional factors. For instance, approaches like Brainspotting use eye positioning to activate parts of the brain that are involved in processing emotions and memories, promoting healing on a deeper level that regular talk therapy might not fully reach.
4. Therapeutic Support: Consider discussing these symptoms with a therapist who specialises in somatic experiencing or body-oriented therapies. These approaches focus on integrating physical sensations with emotional experiences to promote healing and symptom relief.
5. Self-Care Practices: Continue with your current self-care practices, such as walks and listening to music, as they are supportive in managing stress. Additionally, gentle yoga or meditation practices that emphasise body awareness and relaxation could complement your routine.
6. Journal Prompts: Journaling offers several benefits for mental and emotional well-being. It provides a private space to express thoughts, emotions, and experiences without judgment. Journaling and prompts offer a structured yet flexible way to support mental health and personal development.
Here are some prompts for your consideration:
- Reflect on your current self-care routine. What activities or practices bring you the most comfort or relaxation during times of stress or discomfort?
- Explore how your emotions impact your physical health. Are there specific emotional states that seem to correlate with your swallowing difficulties or other symptoms?
- Describe a recent stressful situation and how it affected your body. What physical sensations did you notice during this time?
- Consider your support system. Who are the people in your life that you feel comfortable discussing your health concerns with? How do they support you?
- Imagine yourself practicing self-compassion. How can you show kindness and understanding towards yourself during challenging times?
- Explore your relationship with food and eating. How has your experience with swallowing difficulties affected your approach to meals and nutrition?
- Reflect on moments of resilience in your life. What strategies or strengths have helped you cope with previous health challenges or stressful periods?
- Explore any fears or anxieties you have about your health or future. How do these thoughts impact your daily life, and what can you do to address them?
- Describe a time when you felt emotionally balanced and at ease. What factors contributed to this sense of well-being, and how can you incorporate these elements into your current routine?
It sounds like the journey ahead may hold more uncertainty than you would prefer. I encourage you to approach it with patience and self-compassion. Trust in your resilience and strengths as you navigate through this challenging time. Remember, it’s okay to give yourself permission not to be okay sometimes. Reach out for emotional support and care too when it becomes overwhelming.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I made a friend this time, a guy (I’m a girl). Friendships are a bit hard for me, because I had some friendship breakups this year, finding out that some of my long time “friends” for years were actually not true friends at all & they were secretly badmouthing me behind my back. I never felt more alone but I really tried to be strong and getting over this eventually
Knowing this new friend at first, I somehow found myself opening up while talking about the school module we were both doing…I guess because we have similar interests, there were naturally a lot of things we cld talk about
I felt comfortable and happy with life as it is, just talking about random things and life experiences
At some point though, we talked more until I felt like the frequency is a bit strange because he has a girlfriend. So I asked and he said they were on a break. I guess honestly I was a little glad, it kind of made sense to me because we were talking a lot
a few weeks later, he suddenly told me he needs to focus on his relationship with his girlfriend & we shouldn’t talk anymore
I’m really sad, maybe I should have seen it coming though, maybe on a break =/= break up & maybe I’m the bad person for talking a lot. I honestly really didn’t want it to become like that
I saw him as a real friend too, I wouldn’t have shared so much if I didn’t. i somehow feel hurt about this although maybe i don’t deserve to be…
I didn’t even know I would be this sad about it, i’m surprised too how down i feel ><",,1,,,,,

Thank you for coming here to share your feelings. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot lately, and it’s understandable to feel sad and hurt after what happened. It can be really tough when friendships don’t turn out the way we hoped, especially when you’ve already experienced the pain of losing friends. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your experiences, and it’s clear that you have a strong capacity for self-reflection and empathy.
You’re not a bad person for wanting to connect with someone and build a friendship. It’s natural to want to share and bond, especially when you find someone with similar interests. You weren’t wrong to feel happy and comfortable during your conversations. It shows you have the capacity for deep and meaningful connections, which is a wonderful trait.
Regarding the situation with your new friend, it’s okay to feel hurt and disappointed. It’s normal to feel sad when a relationship, whether a friendship or something more, doesn’t go the way we hoped. His decision to focus on his relationship with his girlfriend doesn’t mean you did anything wrong. It’s a reflection of his situation and choices, not a judgment on you as a person or a friend.
Feeling surprised by the intensity of your sadness is also normal. Sometimes we don’t realise how much someone means to us until they’re no longer present in our lives. Give yourself permission to feel sad and to process those emotions. It’s a part of healing and moving forward.
I hope you’ll consider the following to help you feel better and build stronger friendships:
2. Self-care: Make time for activities that you enjoy and that help you relax. For example, reading a book you love, going for a walk in a nearby park, listening to your favourite music, or engaging in a hobby like drawing or playing a musical instrument. Taking care of yourself is essential for emotional healing.
3. Reflect on past friendships: Think about what you’ve learned from your past friendships. Consider making a list of qualities you value in a friend, such as honesty, kindness, and reliability. Also, think about what boundaries you need to set to protect your emotional well-being, like how much time you spend with friends and how you handle disagreements.
4. Join clubs or groups: Participate in school clubs, sports, or other group activities that interest you. For example, if you enjoy art, join an art club; if you like playing sports, try out for a team; or if you’re interested in debating, join the debate club. This can help you meet new people who share similar interests and values.
5. Communicate openly: When building new friendships, try to communicate openly and honestly about your feelings and boundaries. For example, if something is bothering you, don’t be afraid to speak up in a kind way. If you need some space, let your friend know. This can help prevent misunderstandings and ensure that your friendships are built on mutual respect and understanding.
6. Seek support: Don’t hesitate to talk to a counsellor, teacher, or trusted adult about how you’re feeling. They can provide guidance and support as you navigate your emotions and relationships. For example, you could schedule regular check-ins with a school counsellor, talk to a favourite teacher after class, or discuss your feelings with a trusted family member.
It’s okay to take your time to heal and reflect on what you’ve learned from these experiences. In the meantime, focus on self-care and the friendships and activities that bring you joy. New friendships will come, and you deserve to have friends who appreciate and respect you.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I’m already in my twenties & have already experienced before friendships that don’t work out, and sometimes I’m not even sure if I was bringing in my romantic feelings …
I do find it hard to open up on (esp prev on dating apps & new ppl) for the fear of being hurt, like this time where I didn’t even know I was maybe opening up to this person too much
I have a deep fear that if someone knows me too well, it doesn’t end up well. When I felt more happy knowing this friend, I felt more hurt by it afterwards too. Sometimes I wish I didn’t feel anything at all, I wish I didn’t care so much…

Thank you for sharing your feelings with me. It’s completely understandable to feel this way, especially when dealing with the complexities of friendships and romantic feelings. It’s important to be kind to yourself and recognise that these emotions are a normal part of human experiences.
It’s tough to navigate the fear of being hurt, especially after opening up to someone. Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to take your time to heal and rebuild your confidence. Remember, it’s natural to feel vulnerable when you let someone in, and it’s also okay to set boundaries that make you feel safe.
Opening up to others, whether on dating apps or with new people, can be challenging. It’s important to find a balance between protecting yourself and allowing yourself to connect with others. Trusting someone enough to let them know you deeply is a significant step, and it’s understandable to have fears around it.
Feeling more hurt after being happy in a friendship is a common experience. It shows how much you value these connections, even if they sometimes lead to pain. It’s natural to wish you didn’t feel so deeply, but these emotions are what make you human and capable of forming meaningful relationships. Perhaps your ability to feel deeply is your superpower. Like in the movies, a superpower can feel like a curse until you learn how to use and work with it effectively. Embracing this superpower can lead to richer, more authentic connections with others.
Here are some journal prompts for you to consider, you don’t have to answer all. Pick those that strike out to you and begin with them first.
- Recall a time when you felt vulnerable. What were the circumstances, and how did you respond?
- How did being vulnerable in that situation affect you positively or negatively?
- What does vulnerability mean to you?
- What are your biggest fears around being vulnerable?
- How have these fears impacted your relationships and interactions with others?
- What qualities do you look for in people you feel safe being vulnerable with?
- Describe a person in your life who makes you feel safe. What is it about them that allows you to be open?
- Write about a time when being vulnerable led to a positive outcome. What did you learn from that experience?
- How can you be kinder to yourself when you feel vulnerable?
- What are some affirmations you can tell yourself when you’re afraid to be open?
- What boundaries do you need to set to feel safe while being vulnerable?
- How can you communicate these boundaries to others?
- What steps can you take to become more comfortable with vulnerability?
- How can you practice being vulnerable in small, manageable ways in your daily life?
- How has your view of vulnerability changed over time?
- Imagine a future where you are completely comfortable with vulnerability. What does that look like, and how does it feel?
- What changes can you make now to move toward that vision?
I’m glad you found my suggestions helpful, and I’m confident that you can grow from this friendship breakup. Take your time, focus on self-care, and remember that it’s okay to feel everything you’re feeling.

Conflicting feelings are challenging. It’s natural to reflect deeply on your emotions and question what’s appropriate, especially when it comes to relationships. Feeling a strong connection with someone can be both exciting and confusing, especially if circumstances change suddenly, like the decision to end a friendship.
Considering the possibility of misjudgment or disappointment is understandable, given the complexities of human interactions. It’s important to honour your values, like avoiding situations that feel like cheating, and to listen to your instincts about what feels right for you.
While it’s normal to feel conflicted and uncertain, it might be helpful to give yourself some time and space to process these feelings. It’s okay to take a step back and evaluate what you truly want and what aligns with your values and principles. Sometimes, clarity comes with reflection and patience. Sometimes choosing to focus on something else like volunteering can help the uncomfortable phase be a little bit more bearable.
If you find yourself continually grappling with these emotions, consider reaching out to a counsellor for support. A counsellor can assist you in exploring the underlying causes of your feelings that may extend beyond this current situation.",,1,,20341,,20341.0,

The funny thing is, I actually didn’t feel lonely at all before this. I was honestly feeling really happy & fulfilled being occupied with work, studies & hobbies. I honestly really loved living life independently
but I’m not sure why after this incident, I start to feel lonely sometimes & a bit sad & also pretty guilty… I do blame myself a bit - he did say he felt being friends with me made things messy for his relationship with his girlfriend. Although he did say it’s not my fault which is true that I didn’t do anything extreme (at most we shared a lot about feelings & experiences but not regarding each other or inappropriate things) I still feel bad somehow. Like I made a negative impact to someone, it feels sad
On top of that, it’s strange, maybe it’s like how drug addiction works? You are a “normal” person before, you feel happier during the experience but when it ends, you’ll feel withdrawal symtoms and you don’t go back to the “normal” state like how it was before
overall, it’s okay, but I feel even more scared of opening up to anyone else now. it was hard for me to open up before & it’s now even harder, I really don’t want to go through this again. I think I’m not good w relationships at all, I didn’t want to cause stress to others but somehow it did…

Thank you for sharing more with us. It’s completely normal to experience a mix of emotions after such an incident. It sounds like you were very content with your independent life, and this unexpected situation has understandably shaken things up for you. I’m really glad to see you have reflective skills; it’s a great trait. I’m proud of you!
Do watch out for self-blaming tendencies. You are not responsible for regulating someone else’s emotions; they are. You are only responsible for regulating your emotions.
Feeling lonely, sad, and guilty can be tough, especially when you haven’t felt that way before. It’s important to remember that relationships and friendships can sometimes bring up complicated emotions, and it’s not uncommon to feel conflicted. Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to have them.
It’s clear that you valued the friendship, and sometimes the line between friendship and attraction can get blurred. Your friend is responsible for regulating his own emotions and having healthier boundaries. It wouldn’t be fair on you to take on the responsibility for his actions or inactions, even if he feels conflicted in his own relationship.
I’m glad that you can recognise that you did nothing wrong by being a good friend and sharing your feelings and experiences. Sometimes, these things happen, and it’s not a reflection of any fault or failure on your part.
The comparison to drug addiction makes sense in this context. Most often, those who recover from addiction usually grow into a better version of themselves. They gain awareness that they are using addiction to numb a pain/wound or something that was missing in their life. They learn how to have those unmet needs met in a healthier way that brings more gain to their life than harm.
It’s also completely okayto feel more hesitant about opening up to others now. Vulnerability can be challenging, and after a difficult experience, it’s natural to be more cautious. As Brené Brown mentioned, without embracing vulnerability, we also shut out our ability to experience great joy and creativity.

In the short run, this may seem like a helpful solution, but in the long run, it may do more harm than good. There is no hurry to make any decisions now; the right person will support you in feeling safe to be vulnerable. Until then, keep working on improving your emotional regulation, communication and conflict-resolution skills.

I feel that I’m not the same though (and that’s kind of a pity). I used to feel like I didn’t need anyone, I’m happy on my own but now I feel there’s a small empty hole in me
At the same time I’m too scared of giving someone the option to cut out another small piece of me that I can’t seem to find back…
I didn’t realise it, I loved feeling that there was someone similar to me who gets what i mean without me explaining. Who will get my lame jokes, my deeper thoughts about my flaws, stories of his past, my happy rambles about random things that I see. I saw that we were both stubborn, we love creating, have career dreams while valuing family, we try to think positively even when it’s tough… Now when I see the same small happy things, I feel sad realising that I don’t have anyone I want to share to anymore. I didn’t use to feel this way. I don’t usually feel like this. I realise I need to accept that he either doesn’t feel the same or that it doesn’t mean much to him. I know though that I will probably remember him for my whole life, because I felt so strongly. It’s a mix of platonic liking as a person and maybe I did like him romantically too, I’m not sure but I know that I haven’t liked someone so much in a long time. I don’t care what he looks like, the job, the money, the history… sometimes he would share things that he was going through & I don’t mind listening to him talk about anything. I hope life goes well for him too in future
I feel like I put my genuine feelings out there but it doesn’t mean much. Am I a robot with a on/off switch that he decided it’s off from now on? I’m already in my twenties, I’m not a teenager, maybe I should have seen it coming, I should have known better. he has a gf & though they were on a break, I feel guilty for these thoughts in my head. & he still has his girlfriend now but I feel broken inside & I feel like I deserve this. On the outside, I function okay but on the inside, the guilt & sadness is crumbling
There was another thing that happened that I feel really guilty about. For a school module, there was a 2% homework. After doing, I shared my answer & he shared his. I realised that his was right & mine was wrong so I followed his write-up. I cited his name under “study group member” in the submission and the homework instructions mentioned “you are free to discuss with others, cite them”. My final submission was very similar to his though and we got an email from the faculty for plagiarism. I didn’t think it was a big deal when I was submitting, I just saw it as a small homework & I realise I didn’t even show him the final version I submitted. We both got 0% on the homework & since he had a past offense from another module, it was referred to office of student affairs and he was saying they may even put the offense in his transcript. He said he was very very disappointed & I broke his trust, which I understand why he’ll feel that way since he didn’t do anything wrong at all & he didn’t even know that I submitted something so similar. I told the faculty that I’m okay with any level of punishment & the entire incident was solely my fault & responsibility but they didn’t accept this. The timing of this is after he said he didn’t want to be friends anymore too so I think this is the final nail in the coffin. I sent a lot of messages apologising but he ignored all so I realise he’s making it clear that he doesn’t want anything to do with me from now on…
I really feel so guilty and just truly want to apologise but the damage is still there & I don’t know what I can do, I can’t reverse it
I guess in a dream world, he will tell me it’s okay that I made a mistake but this is real life with real consequences. I feel a bit numb and dumb at the same time. I really genuinely cared and I messed up & I guess I’m on my own. If I really have to find something positive, I’m surprised that I feel so much after being hurt many times too… Partially because I saw him as a friend so I could open up, but I also blame myself, I should have known better & I shouldn’t have done that for the homework",,1,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing more with us. It sounds like you’re going through another rough patch, and your feelings are completely understandable. Losing someone who made you feel seen and understood can leave a big gap in your life. It’s normal to feel a mix of emotions, from sadness and guilt to fear and regret.
You cherished having someone who got your jokes, shared your dreams, and was there for your happy moments. It’s natural to feel sad when you no longer have that connection. It’s also okay to be scared of opening up to someone new, especially when you’ve been hurt. This experience has shown you how much you can care for someone, which means you have a big heart and a lot to give.
Regarding the homework incident, it sounds to me that you had good intentions, but things didn’t turn out as you hoped. You tried to be honest by citing him, but it still led to a misunderstanding and consequences. It’s important to learn from this experience, but also to forgive yourself. Everyone makes mistakes, and what matters is how you grow from them.
Feeling guilty and sad shows you care deeply about your actions and their impact on others. It’s part of being human. Over time, these feelings will help you become more mindful and considerate in your future choices.
Remember to be kind to yourself. It’s okay to alot right now; these feelings will pass. Focus on your own healing and self-care. I hope you have reached out to a professional counsellor for support to process these emotions.
You’re not a robot with an on/off switch. You’re a person with real feelings and experiences. It’s okay to feel deeply and to be hurt. Take things one step at a time, and know that you have the strength to move forward, even if it feels hard right now.",,1,,20882,,20882.0,

i don’t know why, i realise that this person isn’t particularly humorous or handsome or rich or interesting “bad boy” type - but you know he makes normal daily life interesting? he’ll talk about his vitamin supplements, and i don’t really care about vitamins usually but why am i interested in hearing about his vitamins he’s taking? why am i curious about how he was like in primary sch, secondary school, maybe i think he’s cool for the tough things he went through & creative ideas he has in school & life.
i yap a lot too about random things in my day & things i experienced when i was young. i’m actually usually not a yapper, i okay with keeping to myself & i’m also not particularly humourous but i felt heard, i felt like what i say is interesting even when it’s not… (i would like to think i make people smile)
i’m reallyy not usually like this, people who know me would know, i’m pretty introverted so i like to spend time by myself, just chilling at home doing my own hobbies. my favourite place to be at is at home, creating things. sometimes when i’m going to meet my friend group, i secretly prefer to be at home (i do want to meet them but I like home a lot too)
maybe i’m repeating myself from earlier, but maybe a part of me still wants to talk about him & think about him. being by myself feels lonely now.
just thinking about him still makes me feel like crying & I feel sadly alone instead of happily alone
Actually, on hindsight, even the choice to “unfriend” me was a good choice from him because I didn’t even realise how much i liked him already until this happened & I started reflecting
if i over-think even deeper, i honestly think he may have liked me a bit too (that’s why he said it’s affecting his relationship right?) thinking more, maybe it’s not such a pure friendship after all… maybe along the way he was also assessing me and at the end realising that i’m not the type he wants to be with?
it’s true that i’m a chronic over-thinker, but maybe if i think in this way it’s better. maybe i didn’t really lose a meaningful friendship at all, maybe it was never real to begin with. to be honest, we video-called in a group setting with other study group members but i haven’t met him in-person…it’s kind of crazy that i feel this way for someone i never met in-person, clearly it’s easier for him to let go & maybe i will finally wake up one day and not feel affected…
maybe i’m just being dramatic over nothing much, i actually shouldn’t even be feeling this way after all",,1,,,,,

Thank you for your reply and deep reflections .
It sounds like you are continuing to experience a mix of emotions and reflections after realizing your feelings for this person. May I share that I think it is completely normal to feel this way. All the more, too, because you connected with him at a deeper level. May I assure you it will feel better eventually.
Firstly acknowledge that whatever you are feeling is valid and it is fully understandable that you feel attached to him and expected more.
Yes, I agree that sometimes mundane conversations like the one you mentioned about vitamins are key in revealing a deeper connection. More than the topic, it was the feeling of being heard and understood that resonated with you.
It’s ok to feel sad and lonely as you process your emotions. Allow yourself to feel these emotions but also practise self-compassion.
Take your time to reflect and heal. Focus on your hobbies you mentioned and develop your sense of self-worth. It hurts now, but I think you will surprise how your feelings may evolve over time.
Keep in mind that you 100% deserve someone who reciprocates your feelings and values your connection equally.
If this person isn’t meant to be in your life, someone else will come along and appreciate you for who you are. But meanwhile, remember your worth is not dependent on any situation or person.
You are lovable and enough, and deserve happiness, respect and love.

I guess I just need to accept that friends may come & go in seasons and it’s okay that it’s like so
maybe it’s because of experiences like this that make me want to keep to myself even more. I guess that’s not a bad thing right?
The other time this happened to me, it’s maybe 6 years ago & we were close friends. I didn’t like him romantically but maybe he did - it didn’t end well and I was really crushed when the friendship ended abruptly (probably when he found out I didn’t feel the same). I also felt like he changed suddenly and it was my first time experiencing - from talking everyday to not at all…he confided in one of our mutual friends that he was thinking I was too dependent on him. That friend ended up telling me unintentionally & when I knew, it affected me a lot. I told myself I really had to be more independent. I think that was the saddest period of my life, for the first time I felt anxiety (i wanted to be alone but i also felt totally alone and isolated) & mild (I’m not sure if it is) like depression where I could cry almost every day… and every night to sleep. In the end, I healed from that when I went on overseas exchange program for 6 months. It was healing in a way, where I could be healthily independent and also made supportive friends
For this time, I feel a little sad that I never really got to tell him that talking to him made me happy…but then again it doesn’t matter at all. I suppose it’s okay, he doesn’t need to know that it meant a lot to me. It’s probably partly worse due to my experiences which he doesn’t know about anyway
I realised that in relationships, sometimes we give closure, reasons why it’s not working out. we might see it coming too. I think for friendship breakups, it hits me hard because it feels like a sudden chop & you realise you actually don’t mean much & there’s technically nothing wrong with that at all… I guess I can accept that it’s okay if I cared more, it’s okay that others may not give closure or anything at all & maybe only time will heal the wound
Previously he said “give me time” but I think with the homework incident, it’s probably a closed chapter & although I’m a bit stuck in the past (which is typical for me) but hopefully it’ll heal eventually",,0,,,,,

I want to acknowledge the effort you’ve already put into managing these emotions. From what I am hearing, you appear to feel exhausted from your coping. The sense of pain and hopelessness sounds profound. I want you to know that your emotions are valid, and the uneasiness and sadness you’re experiencing are part of a complex emotional process. It’s important to give yourself permission to completely feel this way when you’re experiencing such deep emotional pain.
I may not fully understand, but I recognize the feeling of ambivalence towards dying and that having an end date brings a sense of comfort. From what you say, it sounds like you’re using the end date in the hope that it will end the pain. Even though it might not be the healthiest way, it tells me that you still have a desire for control and relief. How does that sound to you?
It’s also crucial to remember that while you’re affected by this situation, you’ve managed to come this far with your current coping strategies. Your incredible effort and courage to share and talk about it is inspiring to me. If you ever feel up to it, I’d love to learn more about what has helped you along the way, but only if and when you feel comfortable sharing.
In the meantime, we’re here to listen and support you. Please continue to share your thoughts and feelings as much as you feel comfortable. Your well-being is important, and taking care of yourself is the top priority.

Thank you for sharing more about what brings you comfort. I hear you when you say that having a form of certainty with the end date provides you with control and helps you make the most of the time between now and then. It’s understandable how this sense of control can offer some relief.
It’s truly inspiring that you’re focusing on making the most of the present. This perspective shows a lot of strength and hope. Finding and cherishing small, joyful moments each day can make a significant difference. Whether it’s enjoying a beautiful sunset, spending time on a favorite hobby, or connecting with a loved one, these moments of joy and connection are valuable.
I understand that you’re taking a break from therapy. Taking breaks can sometimes be necessary for self-reflection and rest. It’s great to hear that you’re seeking healthier long-term coping mechanisms. Maintaining proper sleep and meals is a fundamental step towards self-care, and it’s commendable that you’re prioritizing these despite the challenges.
You mentioned that it’s been getting harder to cope with intrusive thoughts and feelings. If you’re comfortable, could you share more about what you’ve tried so far to address these thoughts? Sometimes, exploring new strategies together can be beneficial. For instance, some people find that activities like mindfulness meditation, creative expression, or even physical exercise help manage intrusive thoughts.
Your willingness to share and seek healthier coping mechanisms is a testament to your resilience. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Your well-being is important, and finding what works best for you is a valuable part of this process.

Thank you for sharing! I resonate with the idea that having control, especially in the depths of pain, can feel empowering for yourself. I assume that the intrusive thoughts you mentioned make it feel difficult to have that sense of control?
Something that I’ve found helpful when thinking about intrusive thoughts, especially those that might not be saying nice things about ourselves or about our lives, is that they often want something from us (relief from pain, a sense of purpose/control).

Thank you for sharing more about your coping mechanisms. It’s great that you’ve recognized the need for balance and are actively working towards finding it. Distraction can be a useful short-term strategy, but as you’ve pointed out, it can lead to burnout if overused.
From my experience and what others have shared, I’ve seen that integrating a variety of coping strategies can often provide more sustainable relief. Here are a few suggestions that might help you find that balance:
2. Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques:
- Mindfulness Practices: Engaging in mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce overwhelming thoughts. Practices like deep breathing, meditation, and mindful walking can be very grounding.
- Grounding Exercises: Techniques such as the 5-4-3-2-1 method (identifying 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste) can help anchor you in the present moment.
3. Cognitive Behavioral Strategies:
- Cognitive Restructuring: Work on identifying and challenging negative thoughts. This can be done through journaling or with the help of a therapist who can guide you through cognitive-behavioral techniques.
- Positive Self-Talk: Develop a habit of talking to yourself with compassion and kindness. Replace self-critical thoughts with more supportive and encouraging ones.
4. Healthy Lifestyle Choices:
- Regular Exercise: Physical activity is a powerful tool for managing stress and improving mood. Find an activity you enjoy, whether it’s walking, yoga, or a team sport.
- Balanced Diet and Sleep: Ensure you’re nourishing your body with healthy food and getting adequate rest. Poor diet and sleep can exacerbate stress and anxiety.
5. Building a Support System:
- Social Connections: Cultivate relationships with friends and family who can offer support. Sometimes talking about your feelings can provide relief and a sense of connection.
- Professional Support: If you’re not already seeing a therapist, it might be beneficial to explore this option. Therapy can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and develop more effective coping strategies.
6. Creative Outlets:
- Art and Music: Engaging in creative activities like drawing, painting, or playing music can be therapeutic and provide a healthy distraction.
- Writing: Journaling or creative writing can help process emotions and provide an outlet for expressing feelings.
7. Setting Boundaries:
- Manage Commitments: Learn to set realistic limits on your commitments. It’s okay to say no and prioritize your well-being. Overloading yourself can lead to burnout and make it harder to cope with stress.
Remember, it’s about finding what works best for you and being patient with yourself as you try new strategies. It’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time.
How do these suggestions resonate with you? If there’s anything specific you’d like to explore or if you have any questions, I’m here to support you.

On the certainty of death, I think it’s certain that we all will die at some point in time. I’d look at it as maximizing my time here on earth - do as much as I can, enjoy all the delicious food as much as I can and help as many people as I can.

Sometimes, my days feel like a war. I feel like I’m holding up the universe. It’s not like I want to stop, but it’s getting harder to keep up with trying to seem normal. I have to force myself to do things, I have fixations and I’m easily distracted. I think about everything else except the things that should matter to me like getting a job or going out to spend time with people that miss me. I also have an ongoing project to worry about. I don’t want to disappoint myself or anyone anymore. It’s always been this way since I was young, I’m forgetful and careless. It’s really debilitating if I have to constantly hold myself in check with how my brain is wired.
It’s to the point, where I expect at some point it’ll blow a fuse. I get massive headaches and need naps after a few hours of doing some focused task. Sleeping is something that I feel is a luxury, I may have been out for 6-8 hours but my body does not feel that way. At my previous part-time positions, I was never given harder tasks because even though I was hard working, I couldn’t concentrate or do tasks wrong that managers try not to give me anything. The only thing I know how to do is design because I can anticipate and plan ahead for solutions but with my state I feel so unmotivated to look after myself. After a fallout with a person I fell for in my second year, my life kind of snowballed I realised I wasn’t my normal self who could keep her composure and control herself. My triggers became more severe. I had panic attacks when I was in secondary school. I found myself crying in stairwells because my life looked so different from then. I treated the person who I was seeing horribly because of this divided attention I had for everything else. My social life took a tank and everyone who knew me only knew me as the “ studious girl with a lot of potential”. Potential feels like I missed a lot of opportunities, like I could be good at something. I don’t want to keep bumping into things. I almost walked into traffic once before realising a car was going to hit me because I got distracted. My behaviour is a reactionary response to life. Please. I need help.",,0,,,,,

I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through this. It sounds incredibly tough, and it’s clear that you’re struggling with a lot of overwhelming feelings and challenges. It’s important to know that you’re not alone in this, and there are steps you can take to improve your situation and well-being. Here are a few suggestions that might help:
2. Seek Professional Help: It might be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional from your school. A therapist or counselor listens non-judgmentally and can provide you with strategies to manage your symptoms and help you work through your feelings. They can also evaluate whether you might be dealing with conditions such as ADHD, depression, or anxiety, which could be contributing to your difficulties.
3. Create a Routine: Establishing a consistent daily routine can help create a sense of structure and predictability in your life. This can be especially helpful if you struggle with forgetfulness and distractions.
4. Break Tasks into Smaller Steps: When you have a lot to do, it can be overwhelming. Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps and tackle them one at a time. This can make it easier to focus and make progress without feeling overwhelmed.
5. Prioritise Self-Care: Make sure you’re taking care of your basic needs, such as eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising. These activities can have a big impact on your mental and physical health.
6. Learn and try out mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Practices such as mindfulness, meditation, and deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress and improve your ability to focus.
7. Identify Distractions to reduce them: Identify the main sources of distraction in your environment and try to limit them. This might involve setting up a dedicated workspace, or setting specific times for social media use.
8. Reach Out to Trusted Others: Don’t hesitate to lean on friends and family for support. Talking about your struggles with people who care about you can provide emotional relief and help you feel less alone.
9. Set Realistic Goals: Try to set realistic and achievable goals for yourself. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and be kind to yourself if things don’t go perfectly.
10. Educate Yourself: Learning more about mental health can empower you to take control of your situation. There are many resources available online, in books, and through mental health organizations.
Remember, it’s okay to ask for help and set aside time for yourself. You deserve to feel better and live a enriching life.
If you feel like you’re in crisis or having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a crisis hotline (995 or 1767-SOS 24-hour hotline) or seek immediate help.

Thank you for sharing your story so openly, it sounds like something is bothering you and is hindering you from reaching your potential.

Additionally, it can be beneficial to have someone to provide you the safe space and guidance to navigate your issues.

I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. Breakups can be painful.
It’s understandable that you’re feeling hurt and confused. Here are some steps that might help you cope with these difficult emotions:
Allow Yourself to Grieve: It’s okay to feel sad and to cry. Allow yourself to process your emotions without judgment. Grieving is a natural part of healing journeys.
Limit Contact: If possible, limit your contact with him, at least for a while. Seeing or hearing about him with someone else can prolong your pain and make it harder to move on.
Focus on Self-Care: Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Eat well, get enough sleep, exercise, and do activities that you enjoy. Treat yourself with kindness and compassion.
Stay Busy: Engage in activities that keep your mind occupied. This can include hobbies, spending time with friends and family, or even learning something new. Keeping busy can help reduce the amount of time you spend dwelling on the breakup.
Talk to Someone: Share your feelings with a trusted friend or family member. Sometimes just talking about what you’re going through can provide some relief. If you feel comfortable, consider speaking with a therapist who can offer professional guidance and support. If you are in school, your school counsellor would be a safe person to set up an appointment with to talk about your overwhelming feelings of sadness and jealousy.
Reflect on the Relationship: While it’s painful, reflecting on the relationship and understanding what might not have worked can provide closure and help you grow. This can also prepare you for healthier relationships in the future.
It’s important to remember that it’s okay to feel what you’re feeling. Heartbreak is one of the toughest experiences, but with time and self-care, the pain will lessen, and you’ll be able to move forward. Please take care.",,0,,,,,

I have a friend of 2 years. She’s really close to me. She knows a lot of my home life and I know a lot of hers, and to say the least we don’t have a good relationship with our parents. So we like to share with each other. There are times when I can’t necessarily tend to her needs, so I tell her that I can’t help her and she understands. But she doesn’t tell me when she’s tired sometimes, and often times, when I feel bad, she feels bad at almost the same time. So I don’t talk to her about things even when I feel bad. She has a lot of issues, like body dysmorphia and anxiety, and I don’t know how to help her sometimes.
There’s this guy I like, and I never intended to be that friend that leaves a friend because they have someone new to like. But I did. And I hurt her, because I turned to this person that I liked instead of her. Because I gravitated more towards this person. She told me that when I texted her, it was just because I needed attention, because that other person wasn’t giving me any. I hate explaining things to people. I think it happened when I was younger but I realised people don’t like to listen to explanations because they like to think they’re excuses. So I thought that I wouldn’t tell her my exact reason why: I knew that I was not spending enough time with her and I wanted to strike a conversation so that we could bond some more. I knew that we weren’t as close anymore, and I didn’t want to lose that, so I tried initiating conversation so that we could talk to each other. But she didn’t see it that way. And honestly I do see truth to what she says. But I never intended that. She said it in the group chat, saying I didn’t care, and that she needed me to know I was hurting others. I’ve been trying to change everyday, and trying to be better.
Just last month we managed to reconcile and reconnect because of a breakdown I had recently. She came to the bathroom to comfort me because I really couldn’t stop crying, and to be honest sometimes I look back and think that maybe I shouldn’t have opened that door. We went back to our usual routine, but now it’s like I’m walking on eggshells. I’m so scared of suddenly losing her, mainly because she’s one of my only friends. But I can’t find any more reason to why I want to keep the friendship. We’re the very touchy feely kind of type, but sometimes I need space, and after the argument I can’t seem to communicate that anymore. So I pull out of her grasp, and try to reciprocate physical contact even when I feel uncomfortable. I’ll be honest. I think I just felt bad for her. But she likes a lot of things and she likes them loudly, and I can’t find the enthusiasm or the right words to show that I’m listening to her. Sometimes I like to do my own thing and space out, and sometimes in order to get my attention, she likes to hit me, and I’ve told her multiple times to stop. I’m not happy with her anymore. I’m just here out of obligation and the fact that she has already lost friends who’ve ghosted her etc, and I feel like a horrible person for feeling annoyed with the way she talks and everything she does. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I have to text her everytime she feels bad just because I need her to be okay. I pity her. I do, and I feel bad for everything she’s going through. But I can’t deal with her talking about her interests anymore, because she likes to insist that I know them. To be honest, because she’s the one sharing it, I feel less interested. I don’t know why I feel angry and distant from her. I’ve basically stopped starting any sort of conversation unless she starts it first so that I don’t seem like Im just looking for attention again, but now she’s stopped talking to me, and I think it’s starting all over again. I know that I’ve been stressing a lot and have been trying really really hard to be a good person and try to help her, but I don’t think I can anymore. She’s a kind person with a good heart but I don’t think I’m fit to deal with this. I feel horrible for even thinking that way, and I feel bad that now I’m slowly drifting away from her because of my irritation. I know how it feels to have someone leave you because it’s annoying to have you around, but I don’t want to do that to her.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for you courage in facing your challenges head on. There is a lot that you are processing and that is not for the faint-hearted.
Firstly, acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It’s fully understandable to experience the feelings of being overwhelmed, frustrated and choosing to distant from your friend. Your emotions do count.
I sense you are carrying a heavy emotional load in this friendship. On the one hand, you are endeavouring to be supportive but realising that doing that is taking a toll on your own well-being. It may be timely to prioritise your own emotional well-being.
Set boundaries on what is acceptable and what is not. Be firm with yourself and your friend.
I suggest it would be more appropriate and effective if she can seek professional help from a counsellor for her struggles and challenges.
Take a hard look at this friendship and assess what you want from it. Communicate your needs and agree among yourselves on boundaries to observe. A friendship where both of you feel growth and support is ideal.
More importantly, you can only pour from a full cup, so fill your cup first, and work to regain your own emotional balance and well-being as a priority first.
Please stay optimistic and work on regaining your own well-being as a priority. Please stay well",,2,,,,,

I just wanted to ask is it okay to not do anything for a year (not employed during this period as well) I have been having self doubt whether was it the right choice for me to take this break after my graduation. Unlike alot of people who spent meaningful time during this break (going out, going overseas, going courses, doing what they like, volunteering), all i did at home was using the phone, watching show and scrolling social media. Literally did nothing value adding. I mean if u were to ask me would i still take the break i would say yes definitely, but I wouldnt take such a long break. Probably at most 6 months and I would have spent the time more meaningfully. Instead these 1 year+ have just been feeling anxious, self doubt and comparing with my peers of the same age as me who is either working or doing things that they like just feels more stressful for me. I took the break to rejuvenate and heal for my mental health but is getting worse i feel unlike many who actually felt better after the break. And i tried finding someone with exact similar situation as me but i couldnt and i just feel like i am the worse. Can someone enlighten me about my current situation?",,1,,,,,

It sounds like you’re struggling with feelings of guilt, self-doubt, and anxiety about your decision to take a break after graduation. You’re comparing yourself to peers who seem to be achieving more, and feeling like you’ve wasted time.
Firstly, acknowledge that taking a break for mental health reasons is courageous and essential! It’s okay to prioritize your well-being.
However, it’s also important to recognize that excessive screen time and inactivity can amplify feelings of lethargy and self-doubt.
Consider the following:
- Reflect on your goals and aspirations. What do you want to achieve in the next 6-12 months?
- Break your goals into smaller, manageable steps.
- Explore activities that bring you joy and fulfillment (e.g., hobbies, volunteering, learning a new skill).
- Set boundaries with social media and screen time.
- Seek support from a therapist or counselor to address anxiety and self-doubt.
Remember, everyone’s journey is unique, and comparisons can be harmful. Focus on your growth and progress, not others’. Everyone is running their own race.
You are not alone, and it’s never too late to choose making a positive change. Take small steps towards a more fulfilling life, and be kind to yourself along the way!",,2,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out. Your journey is unique and comparisons are not healthy. Others did not go thru your life experiences, challenges and circumstances.
I sense you are currently determined to get back on your feet after a difficult time and that itself is a huge victory that you can be proud of. Well done!
Start small and make daily progress towards reaching your goals and aspirations.
I encourage you to not look back too much but instead focus on what you can now directly control - your future.
Slowly, pay less attention to those negative feelings. Let them remain in the background like a radio playing in a mall. Acknowledge them, but actively choose to focus on what you can do from now on to chart your future.
Slowly, those feelings of inadequacy will reduce their grip on you.

Thank you for the quick reply! Really appreciate it! While i know i shouldnt dwell upon the past but soemtimes i cant help but self doubt about this break especially i am seeking for a job but no one has gotten back to me and i cant help but to think is it cuz of this break and my lack of experience (esp most of my exp is internships only) puts me at more advantage. And recently i then know companies r given grants to hire fresh grads and i am more at disadvantage cuz I alrd lost that “freshness”. Like i know i will still take this break if i turn back in time, but I keep thinking i will keep it shorter like max 6 mths… So like is 1 year really long?
And is it really normal and cant help but to think is a waste of time since I wasnt able make full use on it. So sorry that i keep dweling on the past when we r supposed to look forward to the future",,1,,,,,

It’s completely understandable to have these thoughts and doubts! It’s natural to reflect on past decisions and wonder about their impact on your current situation.
Firstly, remember that a 1-year break is not uncommon, and many people take time off for various reasons. It’s not necessarily a waste of time, but rather a pause in your journey.
Regarding your concerns about job hunting, remember that:
- Lack of experience doesn’t define your potential or capabilities.
- Internships are valuable experiences that can showcase your skills and adaptability.
- Many companies value candidates with unique perspectives and experiences, which your break may have provided.
- Fresh grad grants are specific programs, but many companies still hire based on merit and fit.
Try to reframe your thinking:
- Instead of dwelling on the past, focus on what you can control now – building your skills, network, and personal growth.
- Highlight your transferable skills and experiences in your applications.
- Emphasize your enthusiasm, eagerness to learn, and unique perspectives.
Remember, it’s okay to take time to figure things out. You’re not alone in this journey! Keep moving forward, and know that each step brings you closer to your goals.

I’m struggling a lot in a group project. When my group members are discussing and brainstorming, I have a difficult time following because they talk throughout the meeting and it’s just so hard to keep track of what each person is saying (there are 4 of them). One of my group members tries to assign me tasks and checks in on me regularly during meetings to make sure I’m staying on tasks and listening but it just puts me on edge honestly because when she assigns me a task like finding a source, she will check on me after a while and ask what I’m doing and it stresses me because I anticipate she’s going to ask and I feel bad if I could not find the source fast enough. It sucks because I think I have been experiencing dissociation for many years since the trauma of bullying in primary school though I haven’t seen a therapist. It really affects my performance in this group project and I misunderstood or misinterpreted my group members instructions because my brain just isn’t working properly",,1,,,,,

I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through this struggle with your group project. It sounds incredibly challenging, especially with the added pressure from your past experiences. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious. Your feelings are valid, and recognizing them is an important first step.
When I was in polytechnic, I remember feeling a lot of pressure during group projects too. There was this one group member who would regularly check on my progress, just like what you’re experiencing. She would assign tasks and then follow up, which made me feel really stressed out. I would anticipate her checking in and feel bad if I couldn’t complete the task quickly enough. It’s tough because you want to do well and contribute, but the constant checking can make it hard to focus and feel confident in your work. So, let’s tackle this together and see what works for you.
From my experience, instead of trying to follow the entire discussion, focusing on one person’s points at a time can help. Taking brief notes during meetings can also be helpful to keep track of what’s being said. Have you tried this approach?
Do you feel comfortable opening up to your group members? One approach could be to communicate with them about how you’re feeling. Let them know that you sometimes struggle to keep up and would appreciate a bit more time or clarity on certain tasks. They might be more understanding than you expect and willing to adjust the pace. How do you feel about having this kind of conversation with them?
Remember, it’s important to be kind to yourself during this process. You’re dealing with a lot, and it’s okay to ask for help and take things one step at a time.
You mentioned that you think you’ve been experiencing dissociation for many years since the trauma of bullying in primary school, though you haven’t seen a therapist. It’s great that you’re reflecting on your experiences and trying to understand what’s happening. Dissociation can be a response to trauma, but it’s really important to get a professional assessment to understand what’s going on more clearly. Have you considered talking to a therapist about these feelings? They can provide a thorough evaluation and help determine if dissociation or something else might be affecting your performance. More importantly, they can help you work through the trauma and develop strategies to manage dissociation and anxiety.
It’s a big step, but it could make a significant difference in your daily life and group work. How are you feeling about this idea?

I have not tried the approach of taking down brief notes yet, so I just suggested to the group mate (the one group member I’ve mentioned) about this idea and asked if I can audio record down the meeting and she said yes, so I will be trying this approach.
Yes, I’ve been considering seeing a therapist, in fact I found one who I think may be helpful, I just haven’t engaged the therapist yet because of financial (have to ask parents because I’m not working yet) and we still have projects and submissions coming up, I don’t want to start therapy just yet.
Now another problem is the same group mate wants to know why in our previous meetings, I did not contribute or do anything, and I don’t know how to reply! I feel misunderstood though because I don’t think it’s true that I didn’t do anything at all, I did try to research in our meetings but I was zoning out badly, my action was really slow and it looked like I was idling. However, it’s true that I have been under contributing in this group project because of my mental health struggles. I told her that I will let her know through text as I couldn’t explain verbally in our last meeting, but now I feel uncomfortable and don’t really want to tell her about my mental health challenges and I feel like I can’t trust my words if I haven’t seen a therapist, if that makes sense.",,0,,,,,

I’m glad to hear that you’re trying the approach of taking brief notes and recording the meetings. It’s great that your group member was supportive of this idea. It’s a good step towards staying engaged and keeping track of what’s being discussed.
It’s understandable that you’re considering therapy but are facing financial and timing challenges. It’s good that you’ve found a therapist who might be helpful. Even though you’re not ready to start just yet, knowing that you have a plan for the future can be reassuring. In the meantime, have you thought about speaking with a school counselor? They can provide support and might be able to help you manage your current struggles while you work out the logistics for seeing a therapist. School counselors are a great resource, and it could be a good starting point for you.
Regarding the concern from your group member about your contribution, it’s a tricky situation. It’s okay to feel uncomfortable sharing your mental health challenges, especially if you’re not ready. From my experience, you don’t have to disclose everything to explain your situation. You could let your group member know that you’ve been struggling with some personal issues that have made it hard to contribute as much as you’d like.
For example, you could say, “I understand why you might feel that I haven’t been contributing much. I’ve been dealing with some personal challenges that have affected my ability to stay focused and contribute as actively as I’d like. I’m working on managing these issues and hope to participate more effectively moving forward.”
This way, you’re acknowledging their concern without going into details that you’re not comfortable sharing. How do you feel about this approach?
Remember, it’s important to prioritize your well-being. If the conversation feels too challenging, you could also suggest a group discussion where everyone can share how they feel about the project’s progress and contributions. This might take some pressure off you individually and open up a more collaborative discussion.
How do you feel about this?",,1,,,,,

One more thing, I also feel a bit worried about the group project presentation that is coming up for this module.

About your upcoming group project presentation, I understand your worry about remembering what to say, especially if you get anxious. It’s good that you’re planning to write down important points. Here are a couple of key tips that can help you manage your anxiety and improve your focus during the presentation:
Deep Breathing Techniques: Practicing deep breathing exercises can help calm your nerves quickly. Taking slow, deep breaths can slow down your racing heart and reduce anxiety, helping you to focus better. Try inhaling deeply, holding for while, and then exhaling slowly. With each additional breath, slowing it down and holding it slightly longer until you feel relaxed in your body.
Positive Visualization: Visualize yourself giving a successful presentation. Imagine yourself talking to the audience as if you’re having a regular conversation, sharing your knowledge and experiences about the topic. This can help reduce fear and make the presentation feel more natural and engaging.
I am guessing you understand that reading from a script can limit your ability to engage with the audience. Engaging with your audience is crucial for an effective presentation. By visualizing the presentation as a conversation, you can focus on sharing your story and knowledge, which can help your memory recall better because you’ll be less anxious and less likely to blank out.
Addressing your fear and anxiety is the first step in helping your memory recall. When your mind is less occupied with anxious thoughts, you can concentrate better on the content of your presentation.
Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. Most people do. The important thing is to prepare as best as you can and be kind to yourself. If you ever need more advice or support, we are here for you.

13856,Coping with Glaucoma,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/coping-with-glaucoma/13856,Coping,---,11338,Capricorn21,User,,21400,1,"Hi, I’m new to this group here. Just hoping to find some support. I’m 45 years old and got diagnosed with glaucoma 3 months ago. In my left eye, it’s in the mild stage with about 97% of vision left. In my right eye, it’s in the moderate-severe stage with about 77% of vision left. On my right eye, there is a permanent blurry effect on the upper half of my right eye. The doctors believe this is vision loss which is non-recoverable. These past months have been difficult for me. I am currently on prescribed eye drops twice at night and once in the morning to control my eye pressures. My pressures are actually considered low, but apparently the doctors said I have normal-tension glaucoma. The optic nerves in both eyes are also damaged, with the right eye optic nerve in a worse condition. I’ve always been an active person and have been going regularly to the gym for the past 20 years+. The doctors at Singapore National Eye Centre says it’s ok to do my upper body workouts but a second opinion at a private practice says I should stop all my upper body workouts due to a risk of increasing eye pressure during my gym workouts. I’m at a loss as to which doctor to listen to. I still go to the gym but I’m fearful and very wary of straining myself. Even after a gym workout, I’m overthinking if my eyes are becoming more blurry or if I had overstrain my exercises. I’m considered a skinny frame and have been going to the gym to bulk-up. I have considered giving up my gym activities, but the thought of shrinking in size and back to my skinny frame makes me upset and demoralized. I really don’t know what to do.
I have a wife and teenage daughter too. The thought of going blind in future makes me often feel miserable, lost and depressed. While I know that perhaps I can still rely on my left eye which has still good vision, the thought of losing my right eye is very hard to accept. My goals, dreams and plans for my future and retirement seem distant and uncertain. I try not to think about my eye condition but the permanent blurriness on my upper right eye is a constant reminder. I used to be a positive, happy and driven person but this glaucoma diagnosis ha changed me. I tend to want to isolate myself even at home with family, and I just find myself pretending to be ok so that my wife and daughter won’t get worried. It’s very hard, and I’m literally trying to live day by day. I try to ignore the negative thoughts but it sub-consciously keeps coming back. Life seem bleak and uncertain now, and this disease is not curable. I can only delay the progression of glaucoma. I find myself often trying to cope with my overthinking thoughts and anxiety, and often feel depressed. My job itself is quite hectic but I pays quite well. I feel I have no choice but to continue working as I have to save up for the future should my condition become much worse. The reality is it will be difficult for a blind or visually-handicapped person to find work.
There are so many things that go through my mind. My eyesight, my future, the life I had planned with my wife, the plans I had looked forward to seeing my daughter get married and having grandchildren. All these plans seem distant and uncertain now. I’m not sure how long I can tolerate living like this. Just feeling very low and depressed on a constant basis.",,1,,,,,

I am very sad to hear about your diagnosis and the challenges you are facing. It is completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, anxious and depressed. Glaucoma can be a significant life adjustment, and it is important to acknowledge your emotions and concerns.
You are not alone in this journey, so please do take heart. Many people with glaucoma lead active lives, and with the right management, you can continue to enjoy your passions, including your gym workout.
Would you like to consider seeking a third opinion from a specialist to help clarify the risks about exercising. This specialist could potentially also provide personalised guidance.
I believe it is important to prioritise your mental health and well-being in parallel to your physical health. Consider seeking professional counseling or therapy to cope with the anxiety depression and overthinking. Counsellors work closely with you to develop strategies to manage your emotions and improve the overall quality of life
Remember you are not alone in this journey. Your family, friends and medical professionals are there to support you.
I found some resources that may be useful:
Living with glaucoma can be challenging, but it is highly treatable and manageable. Find out how you can maintain good vision with early detection of the condition and appropriate treatment.
Many people have glaucoma but don't know it. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent vision loss and blindness from glaucoma.

Your heartfelt reply touches me and I truly appreciate it. It’s heartwarming to know someone out there cares enough to reply. I did consider a 03rd opinion, but I’m also wary of the vague replies the doctors might advise. 3 doctors from the public sector gave assurances it’s ok to do upper-body exercises, but a specialist from the private sector gave a strong recommendation to discontinue upper body exercises permanently forever. When I raised up the private doctor’s 02nd opinion, the public sector doctors mentioned it does not seem reasonable or even healthy to stop all upper body exercises permanently. Logically it does make some sense to me to still continue non-strenuous upper body exercises to maintain health and well-being. With the public sector, I have found unfortunately that sometimes I am really just another number to the doctors who just don’t care. I have unfortunately encountered a particular public sector eye doctor who told me straight he has no time to answer my enquires as he has many patients in the queue. The doctor then concluded our conversation by telling me my body will be able to adapt to only having one eye eventually. I was alone and felt crushed by his words, and hence spiraled into depression. This is the reason why I’m still deciding whether to spend the money for a 03rd opinion. Sometimes the doctors just give a very grey answer, and brush the patients away.
It is a long and difficult road ahead, and I hope to one day come to terms with my condition. I will likely seek some counselling help to cope with my overthinking, anxiety and depression. Thank you again for the listening ear, and may you have a blessed day ahead.",,1,,,,,

Counsellors typically collaborate with you and together you would be more equipped to manage and cope better. If you are in school, please get in touch with the school counsellor.
Information on other resources are available here:

If you are in need of immediate help, please call 995 or 1767 (SOS 24-hour hotline) to speak to someone.
Even while you are in the process of seeking help, don’t forget to choose making small improvements daily that could improve your mood. Write down what you are grateful for and always show yourself compassion when things don’t go your way. Quieten that self-critic, let that voice chatter in the background, like noise playing on the radio in the background and pay no attention to it. Slowly it will reduce its grip on you.

I’m sad to hear that you’re going through this tough period. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and unmotivated.
Firstly, please know that it’s not uncommon for people to face a series of challenges in life, and it doesn’t define your worth or potential. It’s important to recognize that these obstacles are not a reflection of your abilities or value as a person.
What you’re experiencing is a cumulative effect of multiple stressors, which can lead to feelings of burnout, anxiety, and depression. I believe it’s not a simple phase of stress; it appears that it is a prolonged period of emotional distress.
Here are some suggestions:
2. Seek professional help: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to discuss your feelings and develop coping strategies.
3. Reach out to supportive people: While it’s painful to experience betrayal from friends, try to connect with people who genuinely care about you, even if it’s just one or two individuals.
4. Join a group who share your hobbies as they can be a support group: Connecting with others who enjoy similar hobbies as you can help you build social connections. For example join a running or brisk walking group. The exercise will benefit your health too.
5. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that bring you comfort, relaxation, and joy, such as exercise, hobbies, or meditation.
6. Take breaks and prioritize rest: Allow yourself time to rest and recharge; it’s essential to acknowledge your limits.
7. Re-evaluate your environment: Consider changing your class or work environment if possible, to surround yourself with more supportive people.
8. Focus on small wins: Break down tasks into smaller, achievable goals to help build momentum and confidence.
Remember, you don’t have to face this alone. There are resources available to support you. Keep in mind that it’s okay to not be okay, and it’s essential to prioritize your mental wellbeing.
You got this, and remember to be kind to yourself throughout this journey. You are lovable and worthy regardless of what others say or do.",,1,,,,,

Additionally do take note of any stress you may experience and negative thoughts and you can slowly address them, by asking yourself of any possible reasons you may have this fear.

I am sad to hear about the distress you have been experiencing around sleep. First, let me assure you this is quite common and most of us experience different types of fears about sleep from time to time.
Through taking steps, I am confident you would be able to reduce the fear. I think you are courageous in seeking help, and I see it as a good first step! Well done
Let’s take a deeper look at what you have shared:
(a)Fear of dying in your sleep
While the fear is understandable, it’s important to know that for someone young and healthy to die in their sleep is truly rare.
When such a thought comes up again, try focusing on the facts and statistics which may help reassure you. Let the thought remain in the background, like radio chatter and continue on with whatever you are doing. Do not focus on the thought, let the thought remain in the background. eventually it will reduce its grip on you.
(b)Sleep paralysis
While scary, is not harmful. It occurs when you wake up during a dream and your body is still in a state of temporary paralysis. Understanding that it’s a common experience and practicing mindfulness techniques can help. I personally do some breathing exercises. I take in a breath (3 counts), hold the breath (4 counts) and breathe out (5 counts). All the while, I focus on the breath, imagining the air coming in and journeying through my body. This way, I don’t let my mind wander off into a spiral of negative thoughts. I focus mindfully on my breath and feel calmer as a result.
Nightmares
No one enjoys nightmare. These are often a result of deep stress or anxiety. what changes have been happening in your life that may have contributed to the heightened stress and anxiety? Take steps to reduce stress. Engage your parents and family members or trusted friends/teachers/counsellors. Many students benefit from identifying stressful pain points and addressing those.
Here are some strategies to try.
(a)Think about the nights you wake without nightmares. What had you done differently at those times?
Slowly but for sure you can piece together the unique routine you need for a nightmare-free sleep. Also reflect when the fear of sleep first started? talk to a school counsellor or a trusted friend about it.
(b)Build in a routine around sleep. Have a shower, put away electronic devices and only go to bed when you are feeling sleepy.
(c)Daily exercise is key. You will produce endorphins that relax you and improve mood.
Your body will feel tired, too.
(d)Keeping a bedtime routine and a calm, stress-free environment can help reduce the likelihood of nightmares and reduce the fear of sleeping.
I hope these help. Let us know
Warmly

But I didn’t as I feared those I hurt would find me and I would have to face them, get defamed and ruin the relative peace I have been far away, and live again those moments I regret.

It takes a lot of courage to face and acknowledge past mistakes and harmful behavior. For that alone, well done. You have allowed yourself to feel vulnerable by facing up to your past. One of the toughest things to do, in my opinion.
I agree that the weight of guilt, shame, and fear is overwhelming. You have reflected deeply and your desire for forgiveness and relief is deeply understandable.
I want to share that I hardly know a person who did not regret some of their past actions. It is the quality of being human. To make mistakes.
Here are some pointers to help you reduce the guilt and shame which is affecting you in the present moment:
1.Continue acknowledging your past actions and learn from them. Understand you were likely a different person then, with different circumstances and experiences. You did at that time what you believed was the right thing to do. You probably did not know better at that time. But now in the present moment, you do know what is better. Focus on the present and do better in whatever way you can.
2.Show self-compassion. Is being self-critical helping you or hurting you? Is what you are doing now or not doing now getting you to what you want in your life? Forgive yourself and take steps not to repeat those wrong actions. Do what you can in the present moment to improve, amend or change what is in your direct control. Say sorry as a start.
4. Seek support. Consider therapy to work through your feelings and brainstorm strategies to better manage guilt and shame.
4.Reframe your self-talk. Instead of beating yourself up and focusing on past mistakes, mindfully focus on current actions and on becoming a better version of you.
Self-forgive first. This itself is a process and it will take time. Be gentle with yourself Please take care. You are worth it, always!",,1,,,,,

It must be hard. Your introspection is commendable. I believe that you are already on the path to recovery by sharing your feelings and asking for help here! I think a big part of overcoming these emotions is acceptance and self-love. As humans, all of us are imperfect. Certainly some mistakes made are more significant than others but at the end, most of us are just trying our best to live the best life possible based on the resources provided to us and circumstances that we are presented with. We can afford to be more compassionate to ourselves in many ways
I think you can try journalling down the things which happened, how you think it affected others and yourself, what you have learned from the experience, and how you strive to do better. After you have completed writing the stories, if you are keen to seek professional help, you can share them with a therapist or a friend whom you know will support you no matter what happens. Personally, I find that writing down my thoughts and emotions helps me to reflect and provides closure. I have also tried writing letters and then throwing them away as a symbolism of throwing those negative thoughts and emotions away.

I’m glad you reached out. It’s good to hear from you and to see you acknowledging all these emotions and sharing how you’re feeling. Loneliness can be very difficult. It sounds like you’re experiencing a flood of emotions and a deep need for connection and affection. I want you to know that we care for you and are here to support you. So let me be the first to give a hug !!
Let’s take a moment to focus on what you’re going through right now. It seems that these feelings have been building up over time, and last night was especially hard for you. The absence of a support system can make these emotions feel even more intense.
You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s important to remember that reaching out for support is a strong and brave step. If you’re comfortable, maybe you can share a bit more about what has been going on recently or what has led to these feelings. Sometimes, talking about it can help lighten the emotional load.
We are here to listen and support you. We can take this one step at a time and figure out ways to help you feel more connected and supported. You don’t have to go through this alone.
Please continue to share your thoughts and feelings as much as you feel comfortable. We are here with you.

I don’t even know when this started, but at a certain point, I stopped wanting to get out of bed, and started having trouble sleeping at night. I often find myself crying myself to sleep thinking about things I didn’t think I cared about at 4 AM, and lost all interest in playing football, which I used to enjoy. I keep finding myself envious of other people, just to scold myself for not being able to put in the effort to attain what they have that I don’t. I keep finding myself more and more bothered everyday, and I don’t know what to do about it. I don’t want to tell my friends about my problem either because I don’t want to put this pressure on them. I don’t think it is any particular person’s fault, and I am afraid they will be quick to jump to conclusions that aren’t correct or true. I don’t feel that I can speak to my family either, as none of them seem to be able to keep a secret and always respond negatively to me whenever I ask for help.

To overcome the feelings of emptiness which I experienced, I took conscious effort to participate in activities I liked. This need not be something really sophisticated like volunteering or serving the community. It can be simple, like listening to your favourite song, or exercising. Do something you like so that you can revive your feelings of happiness. I personally felt listening to the radio while doing whatever I was doing, helped me overcome the feelings, This is because, the radio DJs share new topics every day, which enriched my perspective of life. This was especially helpful, as the lack of happiness, may make life seem too daunting. In essence, do things that you love.

Typical case of insomnia. I often woke up at 1 am in the years that I battled this condition. I believe that the fact that I had too much stress, was the factor. I could go close to 2 to 3 hours lying in bed sleepless in the middle of the night. After noticing the onset of this condition after 2 days, I started studying in the middle of the night, cos that was what I felt like doing. Doing this may seem silly, but I was able to be productive and able to make myself tired so that I could go to sleep eventually. Though, I would recommend you not to try this on weekdays, cos it may cause you to feel sleepy in the middle of the day. You need not study when you wake in the middle of the night, you can read a book or even listen to music, to help you become sleepy.

Practise self-compassion. It might be compelling to compare your self with others, but it will just cause your energy to drop even further. If u want to compare, compare yourself with your past. Compare the progress you have made to overcome the situation you are in. It often may motivate you.

I am sad to hear about what you are going through. No one deserves abuse. Is there someone you trust who you can let know what is happening? For example a family member, school counsellor or other trusted adult? It may be beneficial to share your feelings and situation as a form of seeking support and helping you manage the situation in the present moment. An elder could step in as well.
Consulting a professional such as a school counsellor could help you in learning coping skills and brainstorm strategies you could immediately apply to lessen the mental load you are carrying. You are not alone.
Another small step would be to start establishing boundaries, however small they could be. Focus on your goals and create safe space and routines which put you more in control.
Please also do regular self-care, such as doing exercise daily, keeping to a sleep routine, eating healthily and pursuing healthy hobbies. These are enjoyable and remind you of the joys of life
Please contact the hotlines if you are at risk of immediate harm. You can call 995 or 1767 (SOS 24 hour hotline) to speak to someone.
Remember you are precious and lovable always regardless of how others behave .
Stay safe

Q1. How do you move on and rebuild trust?
Q2. How to stop doubting your partner (even in small action like smiling at his/her phone makes me think that he/she is chea ting again)
We’ve talked, and there was also reassurance etc. Promises and clarity has been made too. I’m trying my very best not to think negatively and to trust again. But sometimes just can’t help with the thoughts and doubts.
I know that time heals etc, work on something or hobbies that you like and so on, but it doesn’t really help for now.
Q3. So, how much time does one normally take to really heal and trust again?
Q4. Should you or should you not check your partner’s phone?
From past experience as well, checking partner’s phone means you’ll find out that they are cheating.
There’s a saying that it’s better to not know than to know.

I really appreciate you opening up about what you’re going through. Being cheated on in a marriage, especially with kids involved, is incredibly painful and challenging. It’s completely normal to feel deep emotional pain and fear of being hurt again. The struggle to regain a sense of security and peace of mind can be overwhelming.
It’s also natural to feel frustrated and hopeless when the typical advice, like “time heals” and “find a hobby,” doesn’t seem to help. And those feelings of anxiety and insecurity, especially when triggered by small things like your partner smiling at their phone, are incredibly tough to deal with. I want to acknowledge the strength and courage it takes to share these feelings and seek support. It shows a deep commitment to healing and moving forward. Let’s take it one step at a time.
Q1. How do you move on and rebuild trust?
Rebuilding trust after betrayal is incredibly tough, and I completely understand why you’re feeling the way you do. It’s a process that takes time and effort from both sides.
Firstly, emotionally, it’s important to let yourself feel whatever comes up. Anger, sadness, fear – all these feelings are valid. When I’m able to talk about these emotions, it helps. Sharing your feelings can lead to a deeper understanding of yourself. Recognizing our emotions allows us to give ourselves room and space to feel less overwhelmed and equip ourselves with the skills to clearly call out any negative or unhelpful thinking.
Try to remind yourself that rebuilding trust is a journey. It won’t happen overnight, and that’s okay. I’ve found that changing how I think about trust can be helpful. Instead of thinking, “I can never trust them again,” try to reframe it to, “Trust can be rebuilt with time and effort.” This shift can help you feel more hopeful about the future.
Finding pillars of trust to hold onto daily can also help. Look for small actions that show commitment and honesty. Holding onto these moments can help you cope without getting lost in extreme rumination. It’s all about taking small, consistent steps. You can start with clarity about boundaries and expectations. Maybe we can agree on more openness about daily activities? Simple things like letting each other know where or who you’re with can build trust over time. Also, finding activities that you both enjoy together can help reinforce your bond.
It’s also okay to accept that things have changed. The betrayal happened, and it’s natural to feel like the victim. Efforts are needed from both parties in the relationship, it’s possible to create a new path forward.
Remember, rebuilding trust is a marathon, not a sprint. Be patient with yourself and your partner, and take it one step at a time. How does this feel so far?
Q2. How to stop doubting your partner (even in small actions like smiling at his/her phone makes me think that he/she is cheating again)?
I understand how hard it is to stop doubting your partner after what you’ve been through. Experiencing infidelity is like going through a form of grief. You’ve lost the relationship that made you feel safe, and now the person you thought you could rely on feels unreliable. The conflict within you is loud and persistent, bringing up the painful memory of betrayal over and over. Even small actions can trigger big reactions, and that’s totally normal. You mentioned that you’ve talked about it and received reassurances and promises, which is a great start. It shows that both of you are working towards rebuilding trust.
Your feelings of anxiety and insecurity are valid, but sometimes, just naming the emotion (“I’m feeling anxious right now because…”) can help take away some of its power. Sharing these feelings in a non-accusatory way can also help, you might say, “I can’t help but get anxious when I see you smile at your phone.” This can open up a dialogue and help your partner understand your perspective better.
When those doubts become persistent, techniques like deep breathing or even stepping away for a moment to clear your head can be really effective. Engaging in activities that you enjoy or that distract you can also help break the cycle of negative thoughts. Additionally, creating a plan with your partner for moments when you feel triggered can be helpful. Understanding the intentions behind transparency helps signal openness to communications.
When you feel calm, ask yourself, “Is there a reason to distrust them right now?” Remind yourself of the promises and reassurances that have been made. This can help reduce the intensity of the doubt. Also, consider asking yourself, “How can I take care of myself right now to help reduce this doubt?” Reflect on times when you’ve been able to trust and how you managed those feelings.
Healing and rebuilding trust are very personal processes, and what works for one person might not work for another. Sometimes it takes trying different strategies to find what works best for you.
Q3. So, how much time does one normally take to really heal and trust again?
There’s no set timeline for healing. Healing is a personal journey, and everyone’s timeline is different. The important thing is to be patient with yourself and recognize that healing isn’t linear. There will be good days and bad days, and that’s completely normal, it is about the quality of the healing process. Trust yourself and the steps you’re taking.
Q4. Should you or should you not check your partner’s phone?
This is a tough one. On one hand, checking can give temporary relief, but it often feeds into the cycle of mistrust. And this continues to be infectious and unhealthy for the relationship. In fact, it might be more beneficial to focus on building open communication, such as agreeing on certain boundaries and sharing feelings openly, which can help rebuild trust without the need for checking devices.
For example, you might say, “I feel anxious and insecure sometimes. Can we agree on ways to be more open with each other?” This can help you both feel more secure without resorting to checking. Finding a balance that works for both of you is key. It’s important to remember that rebuilding trust takes time and effort from both sides. Focus on actions that foster trust and understanding, rather than those that might temporarily alleviate anxiety but ultimately harm the relationship.
Q5. So if it’s you, would you rather know or not know?
This is such a personal decision.
On one hand, knowing can bring a sense of closure and control. It can help you make informed decisions about your future. Some people find that knowing helps them process their emotions and move forward. On the other hand, knowing every detail can sometimes cause more pain and make it harder to heal. It can lead to overthinking and increased anxiety, which can make it difficult to rebuild trust and move on.
I want to remind you that it’s okay to have all these questions and doubts. It’s part of the healing process. And I also think it would depend on how beneficial it is for your emotional health. You’re not alone in this, and taking small steps each day can lead to big changes over time. Ultimately, it’s about what feels right for you. You know yourself best and what you need to heal. It’s okay to take your time with this decision. Keeping open communications with your partner and seeking support from a therapist or trusted friend who can help you navigate this complex situation makes a big difference.

THank you for coming here to share with us. It sounds like you’re going through a challenging time with your focus. It’s important to know that many people experience difficulties with attention, and it’s okay to seek help and find strategies that work for you.
One thing to understand is executive functioning, which includes skills like planning, organisation, and time management. These skills help us focus, stay on task, and achieve our goals. Executive functioning can be improved with practice and the right strategies.
Creating a structured environment can be a good start also. Try to set up a quiet and organised space where you can work with minimal distractions. Breaking tasks into smaller steps can also help; large tasks can feel overwhelming and make it harder to focus, so tackle them one at a time. Setting clear, achievable goals can keep you on track; write down what you need to accomplish and check off tasks as you complete them.
There are many tools and apps designed to help with focus and productivity, such as timers, to-do lists, and focus apps. Taking regular breaks can actually improve your focus. Try working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break; this technique is known as the Pomodoro Technique. Staying active and healthy is also crucial; regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and good sleep can help maintain focus and mental clarity.
If your difficulties with focus are significantly impacting your daily life, consider talking to a counsellor or a healthcare professional. They can help you explore if there are underlying issues like ADHD or anxiety that might need attention.
Remember, it’s okay to ask for help and take steps to improve your situation. You’re not alone, and with the right strategies, you can manage and enhance your focus and executive functioning skills or find effective ways to cope.

Thank you for sharing your feelings with us. It sounds like you’re going through a really challenging and confusing time right now. Falling for someone, especially a close friend, can be incredibly complicated, especially when the feelings aren’t mutual and they’re engaged to someone else.
It’s clear that you deeply care about your friend, and it’s understandable that her actions, like frequent video calls, being touchy, and inviting you to events, would lead to mixed feelings. These actions might make you feel special and valued, which can naturally develop into deeper feelings over time.
It’s important to acknowledge your feelings and be kind to yourself. It’s okay to feel the way you do, even if the situation is complicated. Here are a few things you might consider:
2. Reflect on Boundaries: Think about setting some boundaries that can help protect your emotional well-being. This could mean limiting the frequency of video calls or hangouts to give yourself some space.
3. Focus on Other Relationships: Spending time with other friends and loved ones can provide support and help balance your emotions.
4. Self-Care: Engage in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. This could be a hobby, exercise, or anything else that brings you joy and peace.
5. Talk to a Counsellor: Speaking with a counsellor or therapist can be very helpful. They can provide you with strategies to manage your feelings and navigate this difficult situation.
Remember, you are deserving of a healthy relationship with a partner who is emotionally available and willing to commit to you. Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel conflicted. It’s important to take care of yourself and find a path that allows you to maintain your well-being while respecting the boundaries of your friend’s relationship.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

It sounds like you’re struggling with some huge and heavy feelings of burnout, self-doubt, self-worth, self-loathing, frustration and a strong sense of being stuck. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed and discouraged when things don’t seem to go as well or progress as quickly as we think it should. Sometimes when the going has been tough for a protracted length of time, it can be really tough going. Please know that you’re not alone in this feeling and you are definitely worth it.
Remember that progress is not always linear, and it’s okay to take time to figure things out. Comparing yourself to others can make us feel a lot worse, as everyone’s journey is unique and oftentimes, we really do not know what is really going on inside them or behind closed doors.
It’s important to practice self-compassion and acknowledge your strengths. Take small steps towards self-care and prioritize your well-being. Remember, you are hundred percent worth it, and your life has value and purpose.
If you have not already, consider doing the following:
2. Keep an emotions journal to track your emotions, including triggers and physical symptoms.
3. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation.
4. Engage in regular physical activity for better emotional regulation and possibly alleviate ruminations or overthinking.
5. Explore cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) or any other modalities, which can help you address underlying thought patterns and behaviours contributing to how you feel.
Due to the intensity of how you have been feeling, do seriously consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. You deserve to feel seen, heard, and supported, okay?
You can start by talking to your family doctor or doctor at a local polyclinic for a referral or search online for professionals for counselling or therapy. To find registered counsellors and psychologists, you could refer to the below websites:
• Singapore Association of Counsellors: List of Registered Counsellors – Singapore Association for Counselling
• Singapore Psychological Society: https://v1.singaporepsychologicalsociety.org/srp-membership-directory/
If you would like to explore services at social service agencies (SSA), you could try out the following or walk into the nearest Family Service Centre (FSC):

• Care Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353-5800
• Family Service Centres: https://www.msf.gov.sg/our-services/directories
Keep in mind that it’s okay to not be okay, and it’s important to be kind to yourself as you navigate this challenging time. You are doing the best you can, and that is something to be proud of!
Take very good care of yourself, 2227!

My heart goes out to you, dear one! It sounds like you’re going through a really tough time, and I’m so sorry that you’re feeling ignored, unheard, and unappreciated by your partner. Big hug to you! Sending much love and compassion to you.
Firstly, please know that you’re not alone, and many women face similar struggles in their relationships and post-partum is typically a very challenging time for young couples, especially if they just had their first child. Know that it’s amazing that you’re recognizing your own needs and seeking help - that takes a lot of courage! Might I ask if the hospital has been following up with you with regards to your mental and emotional well-being? If not, could I encourage you to please reach out to them both for your mental/emotional well-being and also if you need help with the care of your newborn. Post-partum difficulties with care are well-known to healthcare professionals and they will be well-positioned to offer some help/resources/tips.
Given your current situation, here are some suggestions:
2. Self-care:
- Sleep. Sleep deprivation is often the number one complaint of new mothers. Who would have known such a tiny being would need so much care and attention, right?! Without adequate sleep, we dysregulate easily and things can seem so much worse than it really is. So, you will need to prioritize sleep/rest. When baby sleeps, you sleep. Forget about the housework, sleep/rest first. If you can get friends/family to come in to help with baby care, meals, housework, even better then you can sleep in peace.
- Shower: A basic need of every one of us is often neglected by new mothers. Arrange for someone to look after baby while you shower in peace daily. This is something you can verbalise to your partner, “please take care of baby when I shower”.
- Eat: Eating well is paramount to new mothers, especially if you are nursing or expressing milk. Please ensure that you are eating adequate, healthy, balanced and nutritious food. If your partner can cook (that would be awesome!), if food can be ordered, or if a friend/family can send food order, it might help immensely! Or if you enjoy or prefer cooking, can someone watch baby while you do so? This is something that you can sort out with your partner.
- Go outside: Being cooped up at home with a baby for extended periods of time can do a number on our sense of well-being. If you can, go out for walks with baby in a pram/stroller. Being outside, moving, in nature, can uplift ones spirits and relieve one of feeling stuck at home. While outside, you may also interact with other people like stall owners or neighbours. Sometimes having conversations with other adults is what many new mothers, especially stay-at-home mothers, crave for.
- Find tiny pockets of time for yourself, even if it’s just 5-10 minutes a day. Take a warm bath, read a book, or practice deep breathing exercises.
3. Communicate assertively: When you do talk to your partner, use “I” statements to express your feelings and needs. Avoid blaming or accusing language. Practice letting your partner know what you need, for example, “I am feeling exhausted. Let’s do up a roster and we can take turns to attend to baby for night feeds”.
4. Set boundaries: Establish clear expectations for your needs, like help with baby care or emotional support. Do note that your partner is also a new father and he might not know how to help or know what you need. For some fathers, it can be a perplexing and confusing time as well so try and let him know clearly and simple what you need, for example, “please bathe baby” or “please hold baby while I eat”.
5. Seek support outside: Reach out to friends, family, or online communities for emotional support and connection. Wonder if you have any support from family and friends? Having people over to help with meals, housework or just to watch baby while you rest/sleep can do wonders.
6. Consider couples therapy: A professional can help you both communicate more effectively and work through your issues.
7. Prioritize your well-being: Remember that your happiness matters, too! Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you recharge.
Above all, Shavish23, you deserve to be heard, seen, and loved! Don’t give up - keep seeking solutions and support until you find what works for you and your family.
Keep in mind that it’s okay to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out when you need guidance or just someone to talk to. You got this, mama!

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your struggles with emotional regulation. Firstly, please know that you’re not alone in this! Many people experience intense emotions, and it’s not a weakness, but rather a sign of your sensitivity and emotional depth. Sending you lots of love and compassion! Hugs
I also hear how it has been impacting on your social relationships and it has come to a point where you feel at a loss as to what to do. To cope with your heightened emotions and minimize the impact on your friends, consider the following strategies:
2. Self-awareness: Recognize your emotional triggers and signs of escalating stress (e.g., physical tension, rapid heartbeat). Take a step back and acknowledge your emotions when you feel them rising, try and locate them in your body and simply observe them (without judging).
3. Emotional labeling: When you feel overwhelmed, label your emotions: “I’m feeling anxious right now” or “I’m really upset.” This helps to acknowledge and process your emotions. Naming the emotions may open the way for you to tame them.
4. Breathing exercises: Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nervous system. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, and repeat.
5. Emotional release: Find healthy outlets for your emotions, like writing in a journal, drawing, or engaging in physical activity. Wonder if you have anyone whom you regularly confide in?
6. Grounding techniques: Use your senses (sight, sound, taste, touch, taste) to ground yourself in the present moment. For example, focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, or the sensation of the air on your skin.
7. Communication: Let your friends know that you’re working on managing your emotions and appreciate their support. Ask them to hold you accountable when you’re stressed, but also respect your boundaries when you need space.
8. Seek professional help: Consider therapy or counseling to develop personalized coping strategies and work through underlying issues that may be contributing to your emotional intensity.
Remember, it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, and it’s important to be kind to yourself as you work through this. Your friends care about you and want to support you, but it’s also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being.

And alot of employers actually rejected me because of the career gap. I am not asking for high salary even compared to my peers. I often feel less confidence and it has affected my interpersonal relationship even with my closest friend as i feel shameful not having a job.I tried to find like minded souls and friends in Singapore but everyone around either already have job or even got promotion.

I’m so sorry to hear that you’re feeling ashamed about not having a job. I hear that you are wondering about career breaks and what is normal/not. It’s important to remember that career breaks can be a normal and healthy part of professional development, and it’s never too late to get back into the workforce.
Could you tell me a bit more about your situation? How long was your career break, and what have you tried? Are there any specific industries or roles you’re interested in returning to? Knowing more about your circumstances will help me provide more tailored support and guidance.
Workforce Singapore (WSG) is a statutory board under the Ministry of Manpower that promotes the development, competitiveness, inclusiveness, and employability of all levels of the workforce. They may be able to provide some career coaching and guidance. Perhaps you can check out what they might have to offer: https://www.wsg.gov.sg/home/individuals/career-advisory-coaching ?
Looking for a job takes time and when it is taking longer than we think it should, it can take a toll on us. Try and remember that while our feelings, thoughts and emotions may fluctuate throughout the day and from day to day, our self-worth never changes. Some things you could try when negative thoughts come up:
2. Practice affirming yourself daily: look into the mirror and give yourself a hi-5 and tell the person in the mirror he/she is loved, worthy and so very capable.
3. When negative thoughts come up, you could visualise each of them filling up clouds and floating away or maybe imagine them floating away on leaves in a river.
4. Try taking deep breaths and long exhalations to relax
5. Unload to a trusty journal
6. Keep up a good self-care regime: sleep well, eat well, move (exercise) and meet people and have fun!
Hope this helps! Please take good care!

Thank you for your reply… I think for me, the reason why I couldnt step out to find job is because I always feel ashamed and yet my past working experience have reflected that I am a poor performer which kinda hinders me from progressing…
I do know of the career coach but I still want to try searching one for myself first as I dont like getting help from others as part of my values and belief… The thing is, I feel that I am really weak minded like my other frens who took break enjoyed thenselves and most of the people around me already secured a job…Meanwhile I am like neither nor as I feel anxious all the time. I feel small and kinda affected my interpersonal relationship.

I’m so sorry to hear that you’re going through this. Betrayal can be a difficult experience to overcome, especially in a professional setting. Hear that it has been two years but the impact of that experience still affects your life right now. That must be so hard. Rebuilding trust and opening up to others again takes time and effort. Might I encourage you to be patient with yourself. Here are some steps you can consider trying out:
2. Process your emotions: Acknowledge your feelings and give yourself time to grieve the loss of trust.
3. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being.
4. Set boundaries: Establish clear limits with colleagues and acquaintances to protect yourself.
5. Find a support network: Connect with people outside of work who you trust, such as friends or family.
6. Seek professional help: Consider therapy or counseling to work through your feelings and develop strategies for rebuilding trust.
7. Focus on positive relationships: Nurture connections with colleagues who have been supportive and trustworthy.
8. Take small steps: Gradually open up to others, starting with small conversations and gradually building deeper connections.
Remember, healing is a journey, and it’s okay to take your time. You don’t have to face this alone. Hope this helps!
Take good care!

Especially friends. If I were to be honest, everytime I look back in the past, I see absolutely nothing. Just a void. I don’t remember anything, and there were no memories created. Over and over again it made me question who I was, and what I had become over the years. I feel awful, trying to overcome this absolute dread, but its nothing I can’t manage. However, I’ve started to give in a bit. I gain enjoyment out of nothing, which is why I struggle to create memories in the first place. Yet, I dont feel any intense emotion about it, other than that same dread. It almost feels as if I’ve accepted it, but I know I haven’t. There’s no way I would.
What I remember clearly though, is the last day of the most recent school year, which was like a week ago - considering my summer break also started a week ago. I was absolutely alone. It was a socials event, and I had nothing. There was a boy that stuck to me, so desperately trying to make me not feel alone, but honestly, it only made things worse - yet I appreciated the gesture. In the end, I only felt that way because he was meant to be my “guide” of sorts, as I was brand new to the school, and it was his responsibility to make sure I integrate well into the community. He must be so disappointed that I never managed to do so, with a year gone already. He wasn’t a friend, just an unfortunate boy who was forced to accompany me. I feel so awful now that I reflect upon this, but at the time, he was just an annoying fly who refused to stop buzzing around me. Regardless, this scenario made me realise how I wasted an entire year making zero memories, and I’ve already forgotten most things from the year before.
Everything is just so empty. I gain enjoyment out of nothing. I’m not miserable, or desperate for help; I just don’t know what to do moving forwards. If I don’t remember my past, then I have nothing to base my future on, and it is this very reason I fear the future. I want to know, if anyone were to be kind enough, what in the world my problem is, so I could attempt to improve upon myself. Thank you.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for coming here to share your struggles with us. Well done for reaching out for support! It sounds like you’re going through a tough time, and your feelings are valid.
What you’re describing can happen for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, it can be due to stress, anxiety, or even depression. When we’re under a lot of stress or feeling down, our brain can have a harder time forming and recalling memories. This can make it feel like there’s a void when you look back at the past.
You might be experiencing a freeze response, which is part of the fight/flight response our bodies go through when we feel threatened or stressed. While fight or flight are more active responses, freezing is when our body and mind become still, almost like we’re stuck. Over time, this freeze response can start to feel like the norm because it becomes familiar, even though it isn’t healthy.
As for the the boy who was your guide at school, could we also consider another perspective? He made an active choice to be a good guide. He could have been a lousy or absent guide, but he chose to try and support you. This shows that you are worthy of connection and care, even if it didn’t feel that way at the time.
Here are a few suggestions that might help you start to feel better:
2. Talk to Someone: Consider reaching out to a trusted adult, a school counsellor, or a mental health professional. You don’t have to go through this alone. It’s normal and okay if you aren’t sure how to help your body feel more safe to experience joy again. It is the role of professionals to help you because they have training. They can help you work through these feelings and provide you with the support you need.
3. Engage in Activities: Try to get involved in activities that you used to enjoy or that you think you might enjoy. Even if you don’t feel like it at first, sometimes engaging in these activities can help bring back a sense of joy and accomplishment.
4. Stay Connected: Keep in touch with friends and family, even if it feels difficult. Social connections are really important for our mental health.
5. Set Small Goals: Setting small, achievable goals for yourself can help you regain a sense of purpose and direction. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they might seem. Here are some suggestions for small goals:
- Daily Walks: Aim to take a short walk each day, even if it’s just for 10-15 minutes.
- Read a Book: Set a goal to read a chapter or a certain number of pages each day.
- Learn Something New: Pick up a new hobby or skill, like drawing, playing an instrument, or cooking a new recipe.
- Healthy Habits: Drink a certain amount of water each day or aim to eat a healthy snack.
- Connect with Someone: Send a text or message to a friend or family member every day, even if it’s just to say hello.
- Organise Your Space: Spend a few minutes each day tidying up your room or a specific area.
- Practice Gratitude: Write down one thing you’re grateful for each day.
- Mindfulness Practice: Spend a few minutes each day doing a mindfulness or breathing exercise.
6. Improve Social Skills: In your next social interaction, try one of these skills.
Practice Active Listening: Focus on what the other person is saying, make eye contact, and show that you’re interested in the conversation.
Join Clubs or Groups: Find clubs or groups at school that match your interests. This can help you meet people with similar interests.
Start Small: Begin with small social interactions, like saying hello or giving a compliment. Gradually work your way up to longer conversations.
Ask Open-Ended Questions: These questions encourage more detailed responses and help keep the conversation going.
Observe and Learn: Watch how others interact and take note of what seems to work well in social situations.

I don’t even recognise myself anymore.
I’ve never felt so incompetent and useless. I’ve been trying to get an internship and not a single company has offered me a position, when all my classmates are one by one getting hired. The deadline for me to secure an internship is already over actually, but I’m still trying.
And FYP has been a little short of terrible. Not that I’m doing bad work, I just can’t motivate myself to do better. In reality I just want to give up and never think about school ever again. I chose this route, I chose poly, I did this to myself so I cannot give up, not when I’m so close to the end. But it has taken every drop of self-confidence in myself. Even my friends point out how much I overthink, how much I panic and doubt myself.
Everyday in school, I lose more respect for myself and I hate that I hate myself. I feel so bad about myself it’s not going to stop until I graduate. And when I graduate, I want to try a new path. But what if I suck at that too? Am I even good at anything, will I ever be happy with myself? What do I do, I feel so suffocated. Can I make it to uni? If I give up now, the nights I cried and cried and forced myself to stay up to finish my work and make it as best i can for the past 2 years would have been for nothing. All the times I sacrificed my health, my time for those I love, to get a good grade, if I tank it now then I’ll be an idiot right. FYP and internship takes up so many credit units. But I really really want to throw in the towel. I just want to be myself again.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for coming here to share your struggles with us. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. It’s tough when it feels like everything is piling up, and you can’t seem to catch a break. Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed.
It sounds like you’re putting in a lot of effort and still not seeing the results you hoped for. Not getting an internship when you see your classmates getting hired can be really discouraging. It’s important to remember that everyone’s journey is different. The fact that you’re still trying, even after the deadline, shows how resilient and determined you are.
Feeling like you’re not doing well enough or that you’re not trying hard enough is something many people experience, especially in a competitive environment. It’s easy to be your own harshest critic. It might help to take a step back and recognise the effort you are putting in, even if it doesn’t always feel like it’s paying off. You are doing your best, and that is enough.
Regarding your FYP, it’s understandable that motivation can be hard to come by when you’re already feeling low. Try to break down the work into smaller, more manageable tasks. Celebrate the small victories along the way, no matter how minor they may seem.
It’s also okay to seek support from those around you. Talk to your friends, family, or poly counsellor about how you’re feeling. Sometimes, just sharing your struggles can lighten the load. It’s okay to ask for help, and you don’t have to go through this alone.
Thinking about the future and fearing that you might not succeed is natural, but it doesn’t mean that you will fail. You’ve come this far, and that shows you have the strength to keep going. Even if this path doesn’t seem to be working out perfectly, it doesn’t mean you won’t find success and happiness in the future.
Many people have struggled early on in their school life and still went on to achieve great things. For example, Albert Einstein had difficulties in school and was thought to have a learning disability, but he went on to become one of the most influential scientists in history. Oprah Winfrey faced numerous challenges and setbacks in her early life, yet she became a highly successful media mogul and philanthropist. Similarly, J.K. Rowling faced significant hardships and rejections before her success with the Harry Potter series.
When we feel anxious or fearful, our thinking brain, which is responsible for creative solutions, can slow down because our brain is in survival mode. This can make it harder to come up with new ideas or perform at our best. It’s like our body’s resources are focused on immediate survival, as if there’s a tiger in the room, rather than on tasks like meeting a school deadline or polishing up a resume, which aren’t life-threatening. When we help our body feel safe and cared for, we can then achieve long-term success.
What you’re doing right now might feel like a top-down approach, where you’re relying on sheer willpower and mental strength to push forward. Consider adopting a bottom-up approach instead. This involves listening to your body’s wisdom and prioritizing self-care to enable your best performance. Picture yourself as the manager of millions of cells within you. When you’re kind and nurturing towards yourself, you create an environment where those cells can thrive and excel, rather than just survive under harsh conditions. Providing your body with essentials like nutritious food, adequate sleep, and regular movement gives it the resources it needs to generate the outcomes you’re aiming for. When these basics are lacking, our body naturally slows down to protect itself.
Take care of yourself. Nurture yourself with activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Allow yourself breaks and moments of rest. When your body feels safe and cared for, it can innovate and perform at its best.
Remember, your worth is not determined by your academic or professional achievements. You are valuable just as you are. Your worth doesn’t change; it is not transactional. Adopting a growth mindset that it’s safe to make mistakes and you can always learn can be a helpful strategy. See the gap in any situation as a gap in skill or knowledge and not a gap in who you are as a person.
I hope you’ll choose to hit reset and take it one step at a time, and be kind to yourself. I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

i’m not sure where to begin. really i feel quite stupid and naive for having this happen to me twice. started last year february. i saw a job which let me earn quick money and was desperate so i took it. watched some videos and earned bits of money here and there. then later on there was an investment opportunity which allowed me to earn more money. the first time i tried it it worked fine i got the money back and even more with it. second time after i sent the money i suddenly had to send more (which i didnt have) and ended up asking a friend to lend me some money. after that something went wrong and suddenly i had to send another $1K+, which i didnt have since my bank was basically almost empty by then, had used all my money in the investment. my friends told me to just let go of the $700 i had paid (which was all the money i had) and to file a police report. i did, the police never got back to me, never got the $700 back. my parents weren’t exactly mad, mum called my mistake silly and was disappointed, but hoped id learn from it. dad as well. i slowly saved back the $700 for the next 6 months ish.
fast foward to this year, i was scrolling on instagram when i saw an ad for earning money through watching tiktok videos. me being desperate obviously i clicked on it (you wldve thought id have learned by now). earned about $120, but was told by the bot that was giving me instructions that the minimum withdrawal was $500. later was introduced to this telegram channel, where there was supposedly a way of earning a lot of money, namely amounts starting from $29 000. (who wouldn’t be attracted to it ) this guy, timothy jolliffe, claimed to be a broker who was developing a bot that would help to trade investments on crypto some thousand times per minute, essentially doing what a normal trader would do but much faster. the guy sent me a cryptocurrency wallet and asked me to deposit the money there. minimum amount was $110 but i was a little greedy and put $117. take note i only had about $200 odd in my bank account when i made this transaction. who knows what i was thinking. after the transaction, i was told his team was getting to work, and was updated on the process. when it was finally ready. disaster struck. the guy told me i had to pay $611 to activate my account…. obviously i don’t have $611 in my bank account right so that’s where the story ends. me with my $117 lost, a mere $95 in my bank account and my parents refusing to give me last week’s allowance because my grandma gave me the same amount when i saw her on a couple days ago.
i asked my brother if he was willing to lend me the $600, but he knows of the previous scam and refused because he doesn’t want me making stupid decisions. i asked the broker for some verification of his identify and credentials and he sent me a certificate showing that he is a certified cryptocurrency broker. i feel like i trust the guy but im not sure if its better to just stop here and see how to fend for myself with the remaining money i have left….
if anyone here has been scammed before or can offer some advice or opinions on what i should do or the situation, please help
update:
the guy said he cld ask his lawyer to write up a contract guaranteeing me the money and so i asked him to and this morning he sent a picture of it. went to go google the lawyer guy turns out he’s legit he works for some law firm overseas and the contract said in case of non compliance the European Court of Auditors is authorized to bring the executing citizen to administrative liability.
with this new info is it still best not to continue? what should i do",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your experiences with us in such detail. Your willingness to open up and discuss the challenges you’ve faced is truly appreciated. Please know that your story matters, and we value every word you’ve written.
It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and stressed by these experiences. It takes courage to share your story, especially when it involves feeling vulnerable and making mistakes. Please know that you’re not alone, and it’s okay to seek guidance and support.
Firstly, I want to acknowledge your bravery in opening up about what happened. It takes strength to admit when things haven’t gone as planned, and your willingness to share your story shows that you’re taking responsibility for your actions. Well done
Let’s also acknowledge the emotional toll this has taken on you. Feeling stupid or naive is a common response to falling victim to scams, but it’s crucial to recognise that scammers are skilled at exploiting vulnerabilities and manipulating individuals, regardless of their intelligence or experience. Even PM Lee has been a victim of a scam too.
Moving forward, here are some steps you can consider:
Cease Further Transactions: Given the circumstances, it’s advisable to refrain from engaging in any further transactions with the individual named Timothy Jolliffe or any similar offers. The request for additional funds to activate your account raises red flags and aligns with the patterns of previous scams you’ve encountered.
Verify Credentials Independently: While the certificate provided by Timothy Jolliffe may appear legitimate, it’s crucial to independently verify his credentials and the legitimacy of his brokerage. Reach out to reputable financial authorities or regulatory bodies to confirm his status as a certified cryptocurrency broker. Exercise caution and skepticism until you can verify his credibility beyond doubt. You may also want to get your family members involved to confirm the legitimacy of the brokerage.
Report the Scam: Fill out the ‘Report a Scam’ form and if possible share all communications and transactions with Timothy Jolliffe, including the certificate he provided. Reporting the scam not only assists in potentially recovering lost funds but also helps prevent others from falling victim to similar schemes.
Focus on Building Financial Literacy: Use this experience as an opportunity to educate yourself about financial literacy and online safety. Learning how to identify potential scams and make informed financial decisions will empower you to protect yourself in the future.
Pause and Reflect: It’s crucial to take a moment to catch your breath and gather your thoughts. You’ve experienced a lot, and it’s completely okay to give yourself permission to process your emotions. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this time. Consider slowing down and taking the opportunity to reflect on the underlying motivations behind your desire to earn money quickly. Journaling can be a helpful tool for exploring these thoughts and understanding your intentions more deeply. Here are three journal prompts to help you reflect on your experiences:
- Reflect on your financial goals: Take some time to consider what you hope to achieve financially in the short-term and long term. Ask yourself questions such as:
What are my current financial priorities?
What do I hope to accomplish with the money I earn?
Are there any underlying motivations driving my desire for quick money?
- What are my current financial priorities?
- What do I hope to accomplish with the money I earn?
- Are there any underlying motivations driving my desire for quick money?
- Explore your risk tolerance: Reflect on your comfort level with financial risk and decision-making. Consider the following questions:
How do I feel about taking risks when it comes to money?
Have I considered the potential consequences before making financial decisions?
What factors influence my willingness to take risks in financial matters?
- How do I feel about taking risks when it comes to money?
- Have I considered the potential consequences before making financial decisions?
- What factors influence my willingness to take risks in financial matters?
- Examine your relationship with money: Take a deeper look at your beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors surrounding money. Journal about the following:
What messages about money have I internalised from my upbringing or society?
How do I feel when I have money versus when I don’t?
Are there any patterns or habits in my financial behaviour that I’d like to change or improve?
- What messages about money have I internalised from my upbringing or society?
- How do I feel when I have money versus when I don’t?
- Are there any patterns or habits in my financial behaviour that I’d like to change or improve?
- What are my current financial priorities?
- What do I hope to accomplish with the money I earn?
- Are there any underlying motivations driving my desire for quick money?

- What messages about money have I internalised from my upbringing or society?
- How do I feel when I have money versus when I don’t?
- Are there any patterns or habits in my financial behaviour that I’d like to change or improve?
These prompts can help you gain insight into your financial mindset and motivations, allowing you to make more informed decisions about your finances in the future.
Remember @manda1 you’re not defined by your mistakes. Every setback is an opportunity for growth and learning. It’s okay to ask for help, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this. You have the resilience to overcome this challenge, and brighter days are ahead.

Sorry to hear of your experience. I am replying to you as someone who had experienced something similar in nature to your plight.
My advice would be to cut your losses and cut off contact with individuals of such sort. As much as the monetary benefits are attractive to you, they are created to lure unsuspecting individuals who see it as an innocuous and harmless advertisement on social media.
The hard fact is this: Easy money always comes with a catch, so do think twice before and determine whether it is genuine.
I’d say you’d have to tough it out for the time being unless you would have the time to work part-time to earn back the money.
Do not get me wrong on this; we all make mistakes in life, and this is part of life’s experiences for you to take in and learn and grow from there.",,1,,,,,

I am sorry to break it to you, but as how you have described, genuine or not, it sounds like a common ploy that starts with them extracting small amounts of money from you first to earn your trust, as well as to keep your interest with them. The amount of money will start to snowball and you have to cough out far more than the $117 dollars that you placed at the very start. It’s a wild goose chase they may end up with you at the end of your rope.
I will strongly advise you to cut your losses right now, instead of chasing this, where you may never see the silver lining in the end. You can recoup that $117 in a few weeks, but can bear the thought of being penniless if you keep on going?
You still have a chance to turn things around, but unfortunately, you have to tough it out now, since you’ve already parted with that cash.
Do not even think of borrowing money from your friends, That is the worst way to ruin your friendships and your friends’ finances. Period.
Also, I would suggest to safeguard yourself by changing your bank account login details, should you have provided those individuals so that they cannot do any more harm to you, period.
I hope this advice serves you well and as a reminder that money is hard-earned.",,1,,,,,

Sounds to me that a part of you is hoping for this to be legitimate and for you to earn money quickly and there is a part of you that is still doubtful. Something about the reply you got has raised a red flag for you. Well done on hitting pause and seeking support.
I’d like you to reflect on the following questions:
1.) Are you aware of any law that guarantees someone money?
2.) What’s the evidence that the lawyer’s write-up is valid in a court of law?
3.) Is google alone a sufficient way of confirming the law firm? Can people create fake websites and information?
4.) What do you understand about the European Court of Auditors? Have they got any legal power?
- A quick check and I found this: As the EU’s independent external auditor, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) looks after the interests of EU taxpayers . It does not have legal powers, but works to improve the European Commission’s management of the EU budget and reports on EU finances.
- What meaning can you make from the above paragraph?
5.) What holds you back from sharing the information you got in your update with your brother and parents?

after i lost the initial amount i really should’ve blocked the person… he kept texting and bugging me and asking when i was going to make the payment to activate my account so i could get the earnings. he also tried to make deals with me. yesterday he texted me yet again proposing i just pay half of the money first and when i said no he said my money will be cancelled and he’ll receive a fine if i don’t pay the money. after i said sorry i can’t pay he told me im setting him up in this deal and that that was irresponsibility and i had no right to break the deal. i really should’ve just blocked him there and then…. but i suggested if i could just pay 100 sgd and he said can and i pay the rest after getting my earnings. somehow i was stupid and decided why not… paid the amount (not to him it was to a wallet address on crypto) and then had to verify my identity. first part required face selfies. second part he told me i had to pay 240 euro…… wah i wanna kms eh of course the second part would involve money i should’ve seen this coming…. now in total i have losses of 217 sgd… which is still less than my first scam of 700+ but still…. idk why i keep making such stupid decisions after being warned by everyone around me

I can sense a common theme amongst your posts about wanting to escape, or distract yourself from reality. Your description about getting scammed, as well as your struggles with motivation suggests to me that you are not happy with the current life that you are living, and are looking for quick ways to escape from this situation (through easy money), or ways to distract and not engage with your schoolwork.
I wonder if there is a part of you that compels you towards these patterns of behavior, and whether you can be curious about what that part of you wants?
Some potential thoughts that you might have had:
I’m never going to succeed in school, so I’m not even going to try. Then I’ll have an excuse when I inevitably fail - This part of you might be trying to protect you from having your self-worth impacted by your studies, by pre-emptively self-sabotaging yourself.
If I make big money through this deal, then exams won’t matter anymore - This part of yourself is trying to tell you that your security and future doesn’t depend on your academics, and that there are other ways to be financially secure.
The intentions of these two parts are not malicious, and might even be correct, it’s just that the actions that result from these intentions are not helpful at the moment. Your self-worth does not depend on how you perform academically, even though in JC it can feel like it does, and you can secure financial stability even without performing well academically (depending on your definition of financial stability!).
I would challenge you to ask yourself, Why am I really doing what I’m doing?
What do you really hope to get out of making this money? Freeing yourself from the responsibility of working hard?
What do you really hope to get from distracting yourself? A break from work? Running from your responsibilities? Or some other need that you might have?
Am looking forward to hearing your thoughts if you have any!",,1,,,,,

I understand that you’re struggling with severe anxiety and insomnia, which is significantly impacting your daily life. While the psychiatrist you saw may not have given you a specific diagnosis, your symptoms are real and deserve attention.
Your experiences, such as rumination, hyperventilation, and physical symptoms like difficulty breathing, suggest that you might be experiencing anxiety disorders like Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder. These conditions can manifest without a specific diagnosis, but that doesn’t mean they’re not remediated or at least alleviated.
It’s essential to seek a second opinion from a different mental health professional, preferably an anxiety specialist. They will re-evaluate your symptoms and help you develop a personalized plan to address your anxiety.
In the meantime, consider the following steps:
2. Keep a journal to track your anxiety episodes, including triggers and physical symptoms.
3. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation.
4. Engage in regular physical activity to reduce anxiety symptoms.
5. Explore cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), which can help you address underlying thought patterns and behaviours contributing to your anxiety.
Remember, your mental health is important, and seeking help is a sign of strength and courage! Please do not hesitate to reach out to a new mental health professional for guidance and support.
You can start by talking to your family doctor or doctor at a local polyclinic for a referral or search online for anxiety specialists. You could also explore counselling or therapy. To find registered counsellors and psychologists, you could refer to the below webites:
- Singapore Association of Counsellors: List of Registered Counsellors – Singapore Association for Counselling
- Singapore Psychological Society: https://v1.singaporepsychologicalsociety.org/srp-membership-directory/
If you would like to explore services at social service agencies (SSA), you could try out the following or walk into the nearest Family Service Centre (FSC):
- Touch Community Services: 1800-377-2252
- Care Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353-5800
- Family Service Centres: https://www.msf.gov.sg/our-services/directories
Remember, you’re not alone, and there is help available. Take that first step towards seeking support and know that you can learn to manage your anxiety and improve your mental well-being.
Take good care of yourself!

I am glad to hear that you have been prescribed some medications for your anxiety and insomnia. The medications, as you probably already know, will take a while to take effect and the dosage needs to be titrated. Sometimes, the symptoms may seem to get worse before they get better. Do feedback to your attending doctor if it does worsen or if you feel it doesn’t help. Perhaps you can also request to be given psychotherapy as well as medications and therapy in tandem is best practice. Rooting for you!

Back in primary school , i was a quiet introverted person. I’ve never had the courage to make deep connections like what i see my peers have. They would get together and hang out after school and have fun playing game together.
my connections has always only gotten as far as the environment . My School friends only hang out in school, and noone ever seem to want to hang out with me. These connections i have with these friends are all precious to me, but they only last when i was still in school . When i graduate and move on , so do these friends. Im an outcast no matter where i go, my social skills has stagnated from the very start. I just don’t get why i can’t ever make long lasting friends. Im just never good enough to fit a certain group. Even within people of the same interest, im alone. I get people telling me i’m rude , i’m Egotistical , i gaslight and always think im right. I’ve personally never felt that way and always give myself to my friends by giving them whatever they want. I feel like I’m the one being gaslighted, i really want to improve myself but i was never ever given any opportunities. It always seems people already hate me from the very beginning. I try to talk to everyone and have some positive energy, they usually respond in kind, however, after a while everyone forms their own groups leaving me behind again. In my current situation im in National service and my entire group of people all dislikes me. Even my one and only friend i believed in here , told me its time to go our seperate ways.
I honestly feel very empty, i have no friends that stays except for one who i still chat with since secondary school. Apart from her , im basically the lamest and most hated and ostracized person i know off. Im not ugly or anything , in fact i look average but i am gay and thats always the first thing people wonder about. From the very beginning people will always be cautious of me , making starting an actual conversation almost impossible.

Thank you for coming here and sharing your feelings with us. I’m so sorry to hear that you are experiencing a lot of pain and frustration. Feeling unseen must be painful. Your feelings are valid and you matter!
It sounds like you have some introspective skills and are aware of how others perceive you. It may also be helpful to reflect on specific behaviours or patterns that might be contributing to these perceptions. Consider if there are any moments when you might have come across as rude or egotistical and how you can address those. Here are some journal prompts to help you reflect on and understand yourself better:
- What are the strengths I bring to my friendships?
- Are there any traits or behaviours I notice in myself that might be misunderstood by others?
- Recall a specific instance when someone told me I was being rude or egotistical,
What was my reaction to this feedback at the time?
What words did I use in my response, what was my body language?
Looking back, do I see any truth in their words? Why or why not?
- What was my reaction to this feedback at the time?
- What words did I use in my response, what was my body language?
- Looking back, do I see any truth in their words? Why or why not?
- Are there common patterns in my friendships that lead to them ending?
- What are some triggers that make me feel defensive or misunderstood?
- How do I usually respond when I feel these triggers?
- How do I show empathy to others? Are there ways I can improve this?
- How do I react when others share their feelings or problems with me?
- Recall a time when I had a positive social experience. What made it successful?
- What did I do differently in that situation compared to times when things didn’t go well?
- What was my reaction to this feedback at the time?
- What words did I use in my response, what was my body language?
- Looking back, do I see any truth in their words? Why or why not?
Developing strong communication skills can be a game-changer in forming deeper connections. This includes practising active listening, paraphrasing, showing empathy, and being open to feedback. Consider seeking feedback from trusted adults, such as family members, mentors, or seniors you feel safe with. Additionally, a counsellor can provide valuable insights and guidance in improving your interactions.
Consider working with an LGBTQ+ affirming counsellor or therapist. They can provide customised tools and strategies to enhance your social skills and self-esteem, and help you process feelings of loneliness or rejection.
Building lasting friendships takes time and effort. It’s okay to feel the way you do, and seeking help is a positive step towards making the changes you want in your life. Well done!
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

One thing i realised about myself is that i’m always been said as selfish or rude because i dont proactively talk to people.
I tend to keep to myself and do things by myself, i find it peaceful and nice. However that is most likely seen as selfishness or unstuck. I heard from some old friends that me being by myself is like rude to others.
I didnt mean to look down on others by ignoring them, but things usually start this way. The people i have to hang out with usually do not have similar hobbies and interests so i usually end up being more quieter as i’m unable to get in the conversation.
The longer i stay quiet , the more rumours start surfacing about my problematic behaviour of not interacting with others. I get seen as troublesome and this creates a negative stigma surrounding me. With the negative bias people have in their minds now, any actions or attempts at friendship and conversation turns sour.
Usually my friends and I are not the popular bunch , so although some stayed longer , some eventually leave when there is no need for connections and group works.
I try very hard to make everyone happy , by accomdating ,complimenting and acknowledging everyone. I give them gifts and help them out with things they dont know. They probably do appreciate my help but not truly me.
Although things seems to be going well , whenever its nearing the end of a friendship , they usually start to get less responsive , and start to ghost me. One even blocked me while i thought we had something.
I always listen to others and support them with advice. They usually do come to me asking for help, although they do listen , people eventually get the "" i’m better than you vibe "" probably becasue i always tries to put the best of myself out there. I try not to be vulnerable , so people might have seen me as heartless. Unhappy with their lives, they usually try to tear me down.
The only time i successfully had friends was when i was in early primary school, people just flock to me and we talk and have fun. But it just seem like a distant reality now.
Being vulnerable just makes people think i’m fake, cause how could someone like me possibly be worried or sad.
In the end of the day, i still dont know how to navigate through connections , online friends are what i can get at most. No matter how hard i try i just end up alone, as if every step was wrong.",,1,,20725,20725.0,20725.0,

Thank you for sharing more with us, it was helpful to get a better understanding of your challenges.
Here are some additional steps for your consideration:
2. Self-Acceptance: Recognise that needing time to yourself isn’t selfish. It’s about finding peace and comfort in your own space.
3. Communication: Try initiating small conversations with others, such as:
Asking them about their weekend plans.
Commenting on a shared interest, like a recent movie or hobby.
Offering a compliment about something they’ve done well.
4. Asking them about their weekend plans.
5. Commenting on a shared interest, like a recent movie or hobby.
6. Offering a compliment about something they’ve done well.
- Asking them about their weekend plans.
- Commenting on a shared interest, like a recent movie or hobby.
- Offering a compliment about something they’ve done well.
These small steps can help break the ice and show openness to interaction.
4. Shared Interests: Look for groups or activities that align with your hobbies. Finding common ground makes conversations easier.
5. Authenticity: Be true to yourself in interactions. It’s okay to be quiet, and also express yourself when comfortable.
6. Social Skills Development: It may be worthwhile to learn about social thinking and grow your skills gradually. Some skills to consider:
Active Listening: Paying attention and responding appropriately.
Asking Clarifying Questions: Help the person find their own solutions rather than telling them what to do.
Seeking Permission: Ask if they want advice or just need to be heard, rather than assuming.
Therapy Support : Consider working with a therapist who can provide customised social skills training at your comfort level.
Body Language: Practicing with a therapist can help improve non-verbal communication skills, which are crucial in social interactions.

My company recently installed a digital clock-in system. When the employee/staff is late, they have to cover back the minute that they are late.
I understand is workplace etiquette whereby you’re not suppose to be late. I usually come late sometimes due to external factors like traffic/accidents but I still cover back the timing and did not leave exactly on the dot. I ever took half day and still cover back the timing that I was late. When I am late, it is not like a good 10mins is probably 5-7 mins.
, when people start to “nag/say” their comments to me, I tend to get slightly irritated and just lose motivation everyday to head to work. Honestly, who is at fault here and how do I control my emotions?",,1,,,,,

For your company to spend the effort and time to install such device, it probably means that coming in late is actually causing a problem at work.
It depends if you feel like you are part of the company and want to do your part in follow its direction. Or it’s just a job for the time being till you find a better offer or other opportunity that better suit your interests or goals.
But while still in the company, being a good team player and respecting management’s decision will be better for you.
You can consider changing your bedtime habit such as checking insta, scrolling Tik Tok, online shopping, etc to the next morning when you are always early for work. No more nagging and possibly higher pay raise or better appraisal?",,2,,,,,

hello and welcome to the let’s talk @meefenbeehoon! So it seems like you’re more affected by your co-workers’s comments and not so much about the clock-in system right?
Honestly, I don’t think anyone is at fault. It’s probably a process that your company has invested in because that might help them in monitoring work hours. Are you in like the F&B industry? That seems to be most common for clock-in systems because there are so many part-timers etc that the company needs to keep track of.
I agree that sometimes it can get irritating when people start nagging. What do they say that typically pisses you off most?", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/workplace-etiquette/13431/1,0,,20742,,,20742

Thank you for coming here to share. Your rants are welcome, this is a safe space for you to express yourself and take care of your wellbeing.
It’s understandable how frustrating it can be to navigate the new digital clock-in system, especially with external factors like traffic affecting arrival times. It’s praiseworthy that you make up for any lost time and are conscientious about it.
As for handling comments from others, remember that punctuality is a personal value and belief. It’s okay if our values don’t align with others’. It may be worthwhile for you to self-reflect: if you’re occasionally late due to circumstances like traffic, that’s understandable. However, if lateness becomes a frequent occurrence, it might be worth considering adjustments to your morning routine.
It’s important to consider industry context as well. Flexibility with time is acceptable in some sectors as long as work quality remains high. However, in fields like customer service, timeliness down to the minute is crucial as it directly affects workflow. Consider if your occasional lateness impacts your colleagues’ work experience and is anyone experiencing an inconvenience.
Most importantly, give yourself permission to be okay with not having everyone’s approval. If your value of punctuality isn’t as staunch as others and you’re comfortable with that, you’re not responsible for regulating someone else’s concerns about it. Remember, as long as there’s no negative impact on your work review from your management, focus on maintaining your best work ethic.
For strategies to help regulate yourself, consider this: imagine yourself 5 years from now – will this person’s comment still matter? Additionally, practicing mindfulness or deep breathing exercises can help you stay grounded and regulate your emotions in the moment.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Recently, I have been dealing with a lot of things like friendship problems and other stuff. I little more about myself is that I have a wonderful life, I’m in a loving home with my dad and my mum and my siblings as well as my dog. I have clothes a small weekly allowance and soon I will be going on a trip. My home situation is great and my parents aren’t fighting or abusive. Basically my life is great. Which is why I feel like I shouldn’t be allowed to cry. I don’t cry often but when I cry its from pressure from my parents to do well, friendship problems or things I cant tell my parents. Basically when I cry it means I really have had enough and I cant take it. But something happens everytime I cry, I always link it back to world problems and I think things like, why are you crying when some people are being k*lled or r *ped, some people are even getting hit by their parents or don’t even have food.

It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden on your shoulders. First of all, please know that it’s completely okay to cry and feel your emotions, no matter how good your life may seem. It’s important to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, even if they may seem insignificant compared to others’ struggles. Tears are precious and they are trying to tell us something. So please allow yourself to cry, tell yourself it is okay to cry and be curious as to what the tears have to share with you.
It’s amazing that you have a loving and supportive home environment, and that’s definitely something to be grateful for. However, that doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to feel overwhelmed or stressed about your own issues. Remember that everyone’s struggles are relative, and just because someone else may have it worse doesn’t mean your feelings are any less real. Sounds like it may really help if you could share some of your stresses, problems and just how you feel with your parents. Wonder if you have ever tried speaking to them? If yes, how has that worked out before?
It’s important to practice self-compassion and allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment. Instead of beating yourself up over crying, try to offer yourself kindness and understanding. Remember that you’re doing the best you can, and that’s something to be proud of.
One thing you might try is to acknowledge your feelings and then remind yourself of your strengths and resilience. When you start to feel guilty for crying, try to reframe your thoughts by saying something like, “I’m feeling really overwhelmed right now, but I’m strong and capable, and I can get through this.” You could also start keeping an emotions journal. How does that sound to you?
Lastly, don’t hesitate to reach out to a trusted adult, like your wonderful parents or a counselor, about how you’re feeling. Having someone to journey with you and to offer you support and guidance as you navigate challenges in life makes one feel less alone and more able to do so.
Remember, you’re not alone, and it’s okay to not be okay. Keep being kind to yourself, and know that you’re doing the best you can. That’s all anyone can ask for!
Take good care, starstruck,

13404,How to get over a past,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/how-to-get-over-a-past/13404,Coping,---,10960,anonymous327,User,,20691,1,"Hi, I wanted to ask how do I get over the past. Whenever I think about the past, I always feel a lot of shameful and regrets as I have made a lot of mistakes, big or small. The biggest I made was betraying a group of frens who had a lot of trust in me. As a person who love to imagine, I often imagine scenarios before I go to bed, however whenever the imagination got associated to a bad past, especially the most severe ones, I couldnt fall asleep, feel anxious and beat myself up, even to the point of really wanting to kill myself for the mistake (And ofcourse i wouldnt do it but as an expression to show my shame.) But other than sleeping, there were many times I feel anxious and guilt over my past mistakes for hurting people even the smallest and tinniest ones and I really regretted about my past actions which hinders me from moving on in life as I feel i am not worth and mean. The worst is, these thoughts will not pass and i will hang upon it, which makes me feel guilty, anxious and have cold feeling for a long time, sometimes even til the day ends I will keep thinking about it I know we need to forgive self but is really easier said then done. And i couldnt think about any happy moments in my past. I want to seek advice on how to get over it when the thought comes.
And really how to be in the present moment as well because these thoughts get stuck in my head and it often affect my interpersonal relationship at the present moment as i want to get these thought out first before being in the present but thoughts just stuck with me throughout like hanging there because unconsciously i am grabbing onto it.",,0,,,,,

I too previously cut off contact with people I was once close to in poly due to an unhealthy relationship… and till this day thoughts and regrets about doing so still pops up in my mind especially since I’m still connected to some of them on social media.
I would say after going for counselling, it did teach me a few things:
2. Thoughts are just that thoughts what happened in the past good or bad I probably had reasons for doing so.
3. Don’t get rid of these thoughts instead let them pass. Imagine it like a floating ball in the ocean, the more you push down the more it will try to float back up. So just acknowledge it and let it pass.
4. To let it pass you can try grounding techniques to bring yourself back to the present. What works for me would be to feel my pillow, bed sheets and take deep breaths counting down the seconds.
Hope this helps! Perhaps also try to think what might work for you the key is to breathe and snap yourself back by doing something and focusing on it.",,0,,20691,,20691.0,

Really just want to first of all acknowledge the tremendous courage and humility you have demonstrated by acknowledging your past mistakes and facing the very painful emotions of regret, guilt and shame that come with them. It’s important to recognize that you are not defined by this one action, and that you have the capacity to grow and learn from it.
Here are some steps that may help you move forward:
2. Acknowledge your feelings: Recognize the shame, anxiety, and regrets, and give yourself permission to feel them. You could choose to journal them down or you could share them with a trusted friend or a counsellor of your choosing.
3. Practice self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a friend in a similar situation.
4. Reflect on the lessons: Try to identify what you’ve learned from the experience and how you can apply those lessons to future relationships.
5. Make amends (if possible): If it’s feasible, consider reaching out to the friends you betrayed and apologizing sincerely. Getting their forgiveness might enable you to move on and eventually, forgive yourself.
6. Focus on present and future: Instead of dwelling on the past, try to engage in activities that bring you joy and help you build new connections. Being present in an intentional decision as our minds are wired with a negative bias. Often, we live in the past and feel depressed or in the future and feel anxious. So yes, let’s consciously choose to live in the present. You could try doing some mindfulness meditations, yoga/pilates or take nature walks and just focus on the information your senses (sight, sound, touch, smell and taste) bring you for a period of time.
7. Seek professional help: Consider therapy or counselling to work through your feelings and develop strategies for moving forward.
Remember, healing is a process that takes time, patience, and self-care. You are capable of growth and redemption. Keep moving forward, even if it’s just a small step at a time.

Thank you for reaching out to us in your time of need. We are thankful that you chose to share with us a little about what you are grappling with in school. Going through tough times is one thing, going through them by ourselves is quite a different thing altogether. Know that you are not alone and we are always here to lend a listening ear and some support.
Can sense that you are in much distress from the symptoms you have described such as problems sleeping, emotional eating, feeling like your mind is in a mess and feeling generally anxious. The stress of all that is happening is truly getting you! Might I suggest some quick and simple ways you could try out to calm yourself down?
2. Deep breathing exercises: Take slow, deliberate breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Make the out breath longer than the in breath, for example, count to four breathing in and count to 6 breathing out.
3. Progressive muscle relaxation: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and moving up to your head.
4. Mindfulness meditation: Focus your attention on the present moment, without judgment.
5. Visualization: Imagine yourself in a peaceful, safe place.
6. Grounding techniques: Focus on your five senses, such as the feeling of your feet on the ground or the sounds around you.
7. Quick physical activity: Take a short walk or do some stretching exercises.
8. Journaling: Write down your thoughts and feelings to process and release them.
9. Listen to calming music or nature sounds.
10. Take a warm bath or shower.
11. Practice a simple mantra, such as “I am safe” or “I can handle this.”
Remember, the key is to find what works for you and make it a regular part of your self-care routine which should include a healthy, balanced diet, good sleep hygiene and movement. Do give the above a try and see what helps you.
Also hear that you feel that you can’t talk to your family as you think they might judge you. I am guessing your form teacher and classmates (other than those involved) aren’t people you can go to as well? Wonder, if you think hard, is there anyone you can possibly reach out to for some support or simply hang out? Sometimes, when we do reach out to people, we might be pleasantly surprised as to who emerges to stand by us/support us.
If you are still in school, may I encourage you to approach your school counsellor for a chat? If you are part of a religious organisation, you may also consider approaching some youth leaders and/or counsellors (if available). There are also community resources you may like to tap on such as:

Slowly we became best friends and we would do anything together, we baked we went to each other’s houses and we even talked about our relationships. We were the type of friends that had known each other for 8 months but we would do everything together. I really felt like I had known her my entire life. L and I entered a friendgroup with B and C. We were really happy but C was really toxic she would manipulate B into hating me and L and at one point we separated, me and L, C and B. L started talking a lot of ■■■■ to Me about C and I listened. Obviously I didn’t say anything to C. I started becoming friends with C and B again but I wouldn’t snitch on L or I wouldn’t say anything Infront of L to not make her mad. (Me C and B weren’t as good as friends as me with L but we were slowly building trust.)(Note that I felt like ■■■■ and I felt like I was betraying her) At one point L pulled me aside and told me she wasn’t comfortable with me being friends with C and B, so I stopped because she was my priority. After a month I received an email from L saying oh you know I’m sorry but I’m friends with C and B, you can be friends with them again. By that time I had completely shut out both B and C so I couldn’t really just come back and be friends. L had come out to me a few months before saying she was bisexual. obviously I didn’t tell anyone and I supported her. L started dating this girl E and E had been my friend for a long time. (Note that I am 100% straight). After awhile they broke up and I was there for L throughout. After their breakup I still talked to E because she had been my friend for a long time and I couldn’t just cut her off. After awhile L,C,B started a new friend group with H. I felt left out and as if H had replaced me. I told L about it and about how recently we weren’t close anymore and I felt replaced. She screamed at me and told me the world didn’t revolve around me and that she was allowed to have other friends than me,which obviously she could,I never told her no. (If anything she told me no with C and B). We stopped being friends and they would constantly go like HAHAHAHA YOU ARE SO FUNNY L in front of me.

Thank you for reaching out here for support. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through this. Friendships, especially close ones, can be very complicated and emotionally taxing. It’s normal to expereince uncomfortable moments with our friends, you’re not alone in this.
You and L formed a very strong bond, sharing many good times and supporting each other. Introducing C and B into your friend group added complexity, and it sounds like C’s manipulative behaviour caused a rift. L seemed to have a significant influence over your actions, such as deciding who you should be friends with, which could be seen as controlling.
You felt torn between L and your desire to maintain friendships with C and B. This is a difficult position to be in, and it’s understandable you felt guilty and stressed. Supporting L through her relationship and breakup showed you were a good friend, and continuing your friendship with E was natural since you were friends with her before she dated L. When L formed a new friend group, you felt excluded and replaced, which is a painful experience. When you expressed your feelings to L, she reacted harshly, leading to a significant breakdown in communication and understanding.
Navigating friendships, especially in a group dynamic, is challenging. Setting clearer boundaries with L might have helped, as it’s important in any friendship to ensure both parties feel respected and free to have other friends. Open and honest communication is key, and it seems like there were many instances where feelings were not fully communicated or understood, leading to misunderstandings.
It’s normal for friendships, and even relationships, to change as people grow from experiences. Just as our bodies are constantly changing, so too do our relationships and personal needs. To remain true to yourself while allowing others to grow and change, it’s important to recognise that your sense of worth doesn’t depend on others’ actions. Give yourself permission to allow friendships to come and go. While a sense of loyalty is valuable, blind loyalty can be costly.
Perhaps viewing this situation in terms of who is right and who is wrong may not be very fruitful. Emotions and communication have many layers, and everyone’s feelings and perspectives are valid. What matters more is how each person chose to communicate and regulate their emotions, which is an area where everyone can improve.
If I may suggest an area of improvement for you, it will be, learning to speak for your needs and communicate your expectations. Emphasise your value system of allowing people to be who they are, and make it clear that you won’t change how you interact with someone just because another person is uncomfortable. Remember, you are responsible for regulating your own emotions, not those of others. You can choose to accommodate others, and ideally not at the expense of your own well-being.
Focus on taking care of yourself emotionally and give yourself time to heal. Try to build new, healthy friendships where mutual respect and open communication are prioritised. Use this experience to learn more about what you need in friendships and how to set healthy boundaries. It’s okay to make mistakes and learn from them; friendships are a learning process, and it’s important to be kind to yourself during this time.
Here are some journal prompts, I hope you will find useful:
2. Reflect on a time when you felt truly valued and respected in a friendship.
3. What qualities made that friendship strong?
4. How do you typically handle conflicts in friendships?
5. Is there anything you would like to change about your approach?
6. What are your non-negotiables in a friendship?
7. Why are these boundaries important to you?
8. How can you better communicate your needs and expectations in your friendships moving forward?
9. Describe a friendship where you felt pressured to act against your values.
10. How did you handle it, and what did you learn from the experience?
11. What are your strengths as a friend?
From what you shared, I get a sense that you have shown great strength in supporting L through difficult times and remaining loyal to your friends. These are admirable qualities that reflect your kindness and commitment.
This unfortunate outcome is not a reflection of who you are as a person or as a friend. You are a good friend who values loyalty, respect, and open communication. It’s important to remember your strengths and to continue being true to yourself. This experience, while painful, is an opportunity to grow and learn, and it doesn’t diminish the positive impact you’ve had on others.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

The snowball of debts started with trying to sustain a living from month to month despite having a stable income as I am working full time. However, along the way, some mishap happened and I took a credit card to temporarily sustain.
And then the snowball effect happened.
I have been trying to take up additional credit card and loans to cover another loan and I am getting tired of this already. None of this loan is used for personal luxury spending, gambling or anything sort of. It was used for monthly food and transport expenses, bills and bank/moneylenders repayment.
On top of all of that, I am working in a an industry that I do not have an interest in. You may wonder how I ended up here . It was because I do it in a favour of a family member, who has now apparently quit the company. I am okay with doing my job, however i have no interest in the industry. In almost everything I do, i feel like i am not being able to live life the way i want to. As simple as working in an industry I have an interest in is not possible. I cannot possibly change job in the middle of a debt, can I?
I have been dragging myself to work for 2 reasons. 1 I have no passion for the job, 2 I am to mentally exhausted with the stuff happening outside of work - debt, family relationships, house stress. Ive been trying for so long to be okay with the job. But i find myself struggling to look forward to work and that has caused me to be late for work everyday.

I’m sorry to hear about the difficult situation you’re facing. It must be even harder when your debt isn’t due to personal luxury spending or gambling but rather essential living expenses. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with debt and lack of motivation. Reaching out for support shows and strength and determination - well done for taking this step .
Here are some perspectives for your consideration:
Seek financial advice from a financial advisor or a debt management service. They can help you create a plan to manage and repay your debts, possibly even negotiating with creditors on your behalf. Debt consolidation could be an option, which combines all your debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate.
- Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS)
- DEBT ADVISORY CENTRE
- Debt Aid Singapore
- EDUDEBT
You could also contact your bank to discuss your situation. They might be able to offer arrangements for a lower interest rate or provide other suggestions on how to manage your debt more effectively. Banks may have financial counsellors who can assist you.
Create a strict budget to track your income and expenses. Prioritise essential expenses and see where you can cut back. This will help you understand where your money is going and how you can save more effectively. Clearing debt often involves the snowball method (paying off the smallest debts first to build momentum) or the avalanche method (paying off the highest-interest debts first to save money over time). Choose a strategy that suits your situation and stick to it.
You may also want to consider speaking with a therapist or counsellor to help manage your stress and mental health. They can provide strategies to cope with anxiety and exhaustion, which will be beneficial in managing your overall situation.
While changing jobs in the middle of debt may seem daunting, exploring new opportunities can help you feel more fulfilled. Look for positions in industries that interest you or that you are passionate about. Consider finding a part-time job in an industry you enjoy. This can provide additional income and improve your overall outlook and motivation. Research and apply for jobs that offer higher pay. This can help alleviate some of the financial stress and provide a fresh start in a field that may interest you more. Invest in learning new skills or certifications that can qualify you for better-paying jobs or roles that interest you more. Online courses and workshops can be a flexible way to enhance your qualifications while managing your current job.
If you feel safe and comfortable consider talking to your employer about your situation. They may be able to provide support or accommodations to help with your workload and punctuality.
Yes, the road towards being debt-free may seem long and tedious, and at the same time that doesn’t mean you can’t experience joy in your day-to-day living. Finding small moments of happiness and relaxation can make a significant difference. Engage in hobbies you enjoy, whether it’s reading, gardening, cooking, or any other activity that brings you joy. Exercise regularly, as physical activity can boost your mood and energy levels. Even a short walk can help clear your mind and improve your outlook. Practice mindfulness through meditation, deep breathing exercises, or simply taking a few moments each day to relax and focus on the present, which can reduce stress and improve your well-being. Spend time with family and friends who support and uplift you. Social connections can provide emotional strength and positivity. Acknowledge and celebrate the small victories in your journey. Each step towards managing your debt and improving your situation is worth recognising.
It’s important to take care of your well-being. Reaching out for help is a strong and positive step.

It’s tough for her and we were encouraging as we know how tough it is to handle it emotionally. She appears to be really happy, doing things that she love like staying up late, eating junks citing this will make her feel like a normal person, we talked to her to try and do less of it as her body needs recovery.
We patiently be there w her, talked to her about how we can get her better together. All these didn’t work. Her condition became worse over the years when it could be better.
Irrationally I always told my family that no matter what I will pay for the best treatment and this had taken a toll on the family as it’s few thousands each month.
My daughter started suggesting giving her money hundreds per day and she will listen to me. It’s irrational to promise we we are incurring debts out there over the years for her bill but on another hand, I’ve been drowning every day as her illness is so critical that she needed a surgery soon and that surgery doesn’t promise good result. She declined the surgery. My heart is breaking and I’m depressive now. I don’t know what to do",,1,,,,,

I wonder whether you feel like your daughter agrees with you that the behaviors your suggested (not staying up late, eating less junk food) will help her in her process of recovery? And if not- what does she think will help her recover? It seems that your daughter might have a different idea of what makes her life ‘happy’ (continuing with this behavior), and that might not be what you agree with (trying to be better).
I think you need to have a conversation with your daughter about what she wants in the long term, (is it really recovery?) versus what you can provide as a father.
I suspect that she might have developed an association between her continuing to have this illness and her receiving special treatment from you. Maybe emphasizing that you will continue to love and support her, and that her taking steps towards recovery will make the process of supporting her easier, might be helpful.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your pain with us. We can sense how deeply you care for your daughter and the immense struggle you’re going through. It’s truly challenging to see a loved one suffer, especially when you feel like you’re doing everything you can to help. I’m so sorry that things have been incredibly difficult for you and your family. Your daughter’s chronic illness is undoubtedly a significant challenge for both her and your family. Encouraging her and being there for her emotionally is important, and it sounds like you’ve been incredibly supportive.
In a situation with so many factors to consider, I strongly encourage you to reach out to a family therapist. A therapist can help you all navigate these complex emotions and decisions. They can facilitate conversations about unspoken needs and feelings, providing support and guidance in this challenging time.
As a parent, your natural inclination is to do everything within your power, and sometimes beyond, to protect your child, especially when they are young. In such situations, it can be helpful to maintain a firm yet loving approach and set clear boundaries. Your daughter’s suggestion of receiving money in exchange for compliance may stem from a need for control in a situation where she feels powerless. It’s reassuring that you recognise the impracticality of offering payment for compliance, particularly considering the financial strain involved. Here are some alternative ways to help her feel more empowered:
2. Involve Her in Decisions: Encourage your daughter to be more involved in decisions about her treatment and daily routines. Giving her a say can help her feel more in control and responsible for her health.
3. Set Goals Together: Work with her to set realistic, achievable goals related to her health. Celebrate small victories to boost her confidence and sense of accomplishment.
4. Find Healthy Outlets: Help her find activities she enjoys that also promote her health, such as creative hobbies, sports, or social activities. These can provide a sense of normalcy and joy.
5. Educate and Empower: Provide her with information about her illness and treatments in an age-appropriate way. Understanding her condition can help her feel more in control and less fearful.
6. Therapeutic Support: Consider seeking help from a therapist who specialises in chronic illness. They can work with her to develop coping strategies and improve her mental and emotional well-being.
7. Peer Support Groups: Connecting with other young people who are dealing with similar challenges can help her feel less isolated and more understood.
It’s also important to take care of your own well-being and nurture your relationship with your partner as you navigate the days ahead. Setting aside time each day for activities that help you relax and recharge, such as reading, exercising, or spending time in nature, is essential. Maintain open and honest communication with your partner about your feelings, concerns, and needs, regularly checking in with each other to ensure you both feel supported. Share responsibilities related to your daughter’s care and household duties to prevent burnout and ensure you both have time to rest.
Don’t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or support groups for emotional support and practical help, as sharing your burdens can lighten the load. Schedule regular date nights or quality time together to strengthen your bond and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of daily challenges. Consider seeing a therapist or counsellor, either individually or as a couple, to help manage stress and maintain a healthy relationship.
Engage in mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing exercises to reduce stress and stay grounded. Ensure you both get enough sleep, as rest is essential for emotional and physical well-being. It’s important to take care of your own mental health too. You’re facing a very stressful situation, and seeking support for yourself is crucial.
By role-modelling self-care and self-regulation, you can gently guide your daughter to make healthier choices for herself during this challenging and confusing time. Your example can be a powerful source of inspiration and support for her.By taking these steps, you can better care for yourselves and each other while continuing to support your daughter through her illness.
May I check, have you reached out to support groups for families dealing with chronic illness? Connecting with others who understand your situation can provide emotional support and practical advice.
I hope you take the time to recognise that you and your family are doing your best in an incredibly difficult situation.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

You’re right. Sometimes, giving things space and time to breathe can allow them to develop naturally, much like when we leave dough alone to rise and let natural processes take place.
Please take care of yourself and prioritise your needs and wellbeing too. Considering palliative counselling could be a valuable option to support your family’s wellbeing during this challenging time.

Thank you for reaching out. Making a mid-career switch after 20 years or more is a significant change, and it’s natural to experience anxiety and self-doubt during this transition, especially in a new and potentially stressful industry.
Changing careers can evoke feelings similar to grief, often termed “transition grief.” This emotional response stems from leaving behind familiar routines, environments, and relationships. It’s essential to give yourself time to adapt to this new chapter, acknowledging these emotions as the first step towards managing them effectively.
Anxiety can sometimes act as a protective mechanism in overdrive during periods of change. Body-based relaxation strategies, such as exhaling longer with a sigh, can help activate the body’s relaxation response. This technique signals to your nervous system that it’s safe to calm down, reducing overall anxiety levels.
Here are some strategies for your consideration:
Establishing a routine can provide stability and a sense of control. For example, set a morning routine that includes exercise and meditation before starting work. Break down tasks into manageable steps to build confidence gradually. If you’re learning new software, focus on mastering one feature at a time rather than trying to learn everything in one go. Incorporate stress-relief techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness into your daily routine to stay calm and focused amidst challenges. Take short breaks during the day to practise breathing exercises or go for a walk outside.
Adjusting to a new role takes time, so celebrate small victories like successfully completing a project milestone or receiving positive feedback from a client. Recognise that setbacks are part of the learning process and embrace opportunities for training to improve skills and confidence. Attend industry webinars or workshops to stay updated on trends and best practices, remembering that making mistakes is a natural part of growth and provides valuable learning experiences.
When evaluating your career switch, regularly check in with yourself to assess anxiety levels and overall satisfaction. Journaling about your emotions can help track changes and moments of fulfilment in your new role. Here are five journal prompts that may be helpful:
2. Reflect on the biggest challenge you faced today in your new role. How did you handle it, and what did you learn from the experience?
3. Describe a moment when you felt proud of your progress since starting this new career path. What specific achievements or milestones have you reached?
4. Write about any unexpected insights or skills you’ve gained since making the career switch. How have these discoveries shaped your perspective on your professional journey?
5. Explore your feelings about the work-life balance in your new role. What adjustments can you make to ensure you’re maintaining a healthy equilibrium between work responsibilities and personal well-being?
6. Visualise your ideal career trajectory over the next five years. What steps can you take now to align your current efforts with your long-term goals and aspirations?
Reflect on whether this career aligns with your personal and professional aspirations. Seek feedback from mentors, colleagues, or a career coach to gain insights and guidance based on their experiences. Give yourself a reasonable period to adjust to the new job and set milestones to evaluate comfort levels and job satisfaction. If doubts persist about the fit, explore other opportunities aligned with your goals and well-being.
Remember, transitioning careers involves navigating various emotions and challenges. Taking proactive steps to manage stress and regularly evaluating your feelings can guide you towards determining if this career switch is ultimately the right path for you.

13185,Jealous and Insecure,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/jealous-and-insecure/13185,Is This Normal?,---,10802,mc21,User,,20245,1,"I have been with my husband for 8 years.
Before we got married and when we first got married, while being happy together, I often felt insecure and would end up trying to check through his phone and messages. I got jealous over female friends that he contacts and got jealous and anxious with past relationships he had though they are all over. I felt insecure all the time. I cannot remember how, but perhaps a year or two into marriage, I stopped feeling this way. But about a few months ago, I found out that he has a hidden album on his phone of sexy photos of females, including some of his friends. I am very sure he isn’t having affair, I trust him for that. But it really hurt me that he keeps a hidden album of boobie friends. I had several conversations with him to talk about my insecurities and he has deleted all the photos. He told me that he just looks at them when he jerks off but he does not love me less. And he has no issues deleting the photos.
I also told him that I am fine with him watching ■■■■ or seeing other girls’ photos if he comes across online or whatever, because to me, it just doesn’t make sense to ask a men to not look.
However, despite being vulnerable and open, and him trying to assure me that he still loves me and will never leave me, I still constantly feel insecure. When I scroll through my own social media and sees pictures of that few friends whose sexy photos he had, or random influencers who have sexy photos posted (whether he follows them or not), I start feeling the ick of insecurities. I feel jealous and anxious and start worrying that he’d like someone else, he might find me ugly.
The logical side of me knows that I am being ridiculous and this makes me cry even more cause I wanna be a confident and secure woman to my man. It sucks that I am constantly insecure and have to go through so much anxiety over my own vulnerability.
I want to be able to trust him because I also see him putting in the effort to assure me. My love language is physical touch and his is totally not. But with our conversations, he has started to hug me more, and hold me more to help me feel more secure. He also texts me more in the day to tell me what he’s doing so that my thoughts dont wander negatively.
I dont know what else I can do to stop feeling this way.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your feelings and worries with us. It sounds like you’ve been navigating a complex and challenging situation, and it’s completely understandable to feel the way you do. It’s wonderful to read that you care deeply about your relationship and are committed to working through these feelings. Well done!
Before we get to the uncomfortable feelings, I’d like to take a moment to also recognise the strengths you bring to your relationship. Your openness and vulnerability are powerful tools that foster genuine communication and understanding. It takes a lot of courage and honesty to address these difficult feelings. It takes a lot of strength to confront insecurities and work through them. Your dedication to your relationship and personal growth is truly admirable.Your husband’s responsiveness and willingness to change also highlight a strong foundation of mutual respect and love in your marriage. These strengths can serve as a solid base for addressing and overcoming these challenges. I hope you’ll take a moment to celebrate yourself and your relationship too.
Feelings of insecurity can stem from many places and are not unusual in relationships. It’s good that you’ve communicated your feelings to your husband and that he’s making efforts to reassure you by deleting the photos, increasing physical affection, and keeping you updated throughout the day. This shows a willingness on both sides to work on the relationship.
Here are a few perspectives for you to consider:
2. Understanding Emotions: Emotions serve as important signals that guide us to understand our internal needs. Often, the strength of our emotions has more to do with past experiences than the present moment. It’s worthwhile to focus on what our emotions are trying to tell us.
3. Attachment Styles: Understanding attachment styles can offer insights into your feelings. Attachment theory suggests that our early experiences with caregivers shape our attachment styles: secure, anxious, avoidant, or fearful-avoidant. An anxious attachment style, for example, can lead to feelings of insecurity and fear of abandonment in relationships. Recognising your attachment style can help you understand your reactions and work towards a more secure attachment.
4. Journal Prompts: Writing can be a powerful tool to understand and process your emotions. Here are some journal prompts to help you dig deeper into your insecurity:
What specific situations trigger my feelings of insecurity?
How do I perceive myself and my body image? Are these perceptions accurate?
What can I do to boost my confidence in my sexuality?
Are there any childhood experiences that might be contributing to my current feelings? Did I witness an affair or experience a significant breach of trust?
How did my caregivers respond to my emotional needs growing up? How might this impact my attachment style?
What qualities do I admire in myself and in my relationship?
How can I cultivate a stronger sense of self-worth and confidence?
5. What specific situations trigger my feelings of insecurity?
6. How do I perceive myself and my body image? Are these perceptions accurate?
7. What can I do to boost my confidence in my sexuality?
8. Are there any childhood experiences that might be contributing to my current feelings? Did I witness an affair or experience a significant breach of trust?
9. How did my caregivers respond to my emotional needs growing up? How might this impact my attachment style?
10. What qualities do I admire in myself and in my relationship?
11. How can I cultivate a stronger sense of self-worth and confidence?
12. Mindfulness and Self-Compassion: Practising mindfulness can help you stay grounded in the present moment and reduce anxiety. Additionally, try to be kind to yourself and understand that it’s okay to feel vulnerable.
13. Positive Affirmations: Remind yourself regularly of your worth and the positive aspects of your relationship. This can help shift your focus from insecurity to appreciation. For example, “I am enough just as I am.”
14. Therapeutic Support: Consider speaking with a therapist or counsellor. They can provide tools and strategies to manage anxiety and insecurity, and help you explore the root causes of these feelings.

Thank you for coming here to share your pain with us. It sounds like you’re navigating a challenging phase in your relationship, and it’s understandable to feel uncertain and emotionally unsettled given the circumstances. After dedicating your time and energy to supporting your partner’s work and businesses during your year off, feeling unappreciated is a valid concern. It’s crucial to openly communicate these feelings with your partner and discuss your concerns about the direction of your relationship.
People naturally evolve over time, and part of growing in a partnership is growing individually alongside each other. Interests change, perspectives shift, and priorities may differ as each person continues their personal journey. It might be beneficial to invite your partner to a conversation or write a letter expressing your feelings and apprehensions. Discuss how his recent preoccupation with card games and disinterest in shared activities has affected you emotionally and impacted the relationship.
Reflect on whether this relationship is meeting your emotional needs and providing the support you deserve. Evaluate how conflicts are addressed and resolved between you. Healthy relationships thrive on open communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to navigate challenges together.
Given your emotional instability and bouts of feeling low, consider seeking support from a therapist or counsellor. Professional guidance can offer a safe space to explore your emotions, gain clarity on your situation, and develop coping strategies.
It’s also important to self-evaluate what you bring to the relationship and how your communication style may have shifted over time. Are you still expressing yourself authentically, and are you open to feedback from your partner about your role in the relationship? Successful relationships involve navigating life together while supporting each other’s growth and authenticity.
If you were to contemplate ending the relationship, what positive aspects would you miss? What aspects would you not miss? What lessons would you take away from this experience? These reflections can provide valuable insights into your relationship dynamics and personal growth.
Remember to approach this process with kindness towards yourself and a dedication to understanding your needs and desires in a partnership. Your self-worth isn’t solely determined by your partner’s actions or validation. You deserve fulfillment and happiness in your life. Invest time in self-care, pursue activities that bring you joy, and nurture relationships that uplift and support you.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Really appreciated for your detail and professional advices. I was tearing while reading your reply. It’s really meant a lot to me as current stage of mind, I’m seeking ways and advices.
I got difficulty in communicating.
I find myself having issue with expressing myself properly and accurately at times, especially when I am emotional.
But like what you advise, may be I can write to tell him my feeling instead.
To be honest, I ran away from home today. Staying outside makes me feel a little better. And also I had spend time to myself, and I can collect all the detail from my past diaries and write to my partner. I hope it’s works.
It’s been a really hard life journey for me. Everything seems ok yet mentally unstable.
I tried to go back to church, however I find myself had disconnected to my group mates.
Emotion always comes at the time when I’m alone and quiet down. That’s when my true self comes. Many times I tried to overcome with some positive vibes, but it’s only last for a moment.
Is it comment for adult to compare themselves with others?
Nowadays most of my friends are married with kids. And I still having unstable relationships (sometime I find it’s such a failure). My parents also keep casing us to get engage since last year but I’m still waiting for the proposal.
I used to quite excited in looking forward for the proposal but now, I’m not.

Thank you for your kind words.
I’m deeply touched that my advice has resonated with you during this challenging time. It’s clear that you’re going through a lot, and I want you to know that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed.
Communication can indeed be difficult, especially when emotions are running high. Our brains are wired to shut off our thinking brain when our feeling brain takes over. This response is to protect us and trigger the fight-or-flight survival response. It’s like having a tiger in the room, and our body views emotional distress from our loved ones with the same urgency.
Even I used to struggle to communicate well when emotionally triggered, especially if the emotions were strong or hit sensitive issues. Over time, by practicing self-regulation daily, like brushing my teeth, I have learned to take breaks, regulate myself, and let my thinking brain come back online before continuing the conversation. There is no shame in having louder emotions; it’s your body’s way of trying to protect you. With support and the development of skills, you can learn to control the volume of your emotions.
Writing down your feelings can be a powerful way to express yourself, and it’s wonderful to hear that you’re considering this approach with your partner. Taking the time to reflect and articulate your thoughts in writing might provide the clarity and connection you’re seeking.
I’m sorry to hear that you felt the need to run away from home, but I’m glad to know that spending some time alone has given you a bit of relief. This signals that perhaps your self-care can be improved. Consider starting a self-care routine so that you can fill your own well-being cup first before you pour your love and kindness into other relationships. It’s important to take these moments for yourself to calibrate yourself.
Comparing ourselves to others is a common experience, especially when it seems like everyone around us is following a certain life path. In the past, comparing ourselves helped us push forward and do better, but now it’s an outdated strategy that does more harm than good. It’s okay to unlearn this cultural belief and shift towards a growth mindset where you seek internal validation and discern for yourself what is in your highest good or well-being.
Having the pressure to be engaged can be really hard. I imagine perhaps your parents believe that being married means you will be supported. However, it’s for you to decide on your quality of life—having the label “married” but feeling miserable because your partner hasn’t got the skills that will help the marriage thrive or choosing a different path till you feel that it is a whole body yes to spend your life together. It’s may also be helpful for you to take stock of how many communication skills and conflict-resolution skills you have. There is no time limit to learn and practice these skills. Start by focusing on improving one skill at a time and build your way up.
Let me reassure you, that there is nothing wrong with you. It’s okay to have gaps in life skills. It’s the skills that are missing and not a reflection of any limitation on you. You have infinite potential.
With the right support, knowledge, and skills, you’ll be able to have better days ahead. I’d like to strongly encourage you to work with a therapist so that you can have a caring and supportive environment to learn these skills and make life decisions based on your well-being as a priority.
Take things one step at a time and be kind to yourself.

Your reassurance really encourage me a lot.
I will work harder to improve my communication skill, learn to express myself better step by step. It might be difficult but I will try my very best. I will start with writing all down whenever I encounter the emotions.
Through your words, I learnt that it’s really important to learn self love before loving others. When I myself can’t even take care of my well being, how could I really love others and sometimes even expert them to love me back as much as I do.
It’s really true, I spent a restless night last night to talk to my partner via messaging. Although not ended as expected, but at least I expressed out as much as can.
He is a very mature and wise man but sometime just lack of “women sense” can’t understand how women thinks and needs.
But I quite gratified that he said “ let’s try to work it out together” which really comfort me and push me to work harder for this relationship.
I understand dealing with these uncontrolled emotions may not be easy for both parties, but I will really try my best to do it. Just allow me sometimes might get depressed again.",,0,,,,,

Well done on valuing yourself and allowing yourself and your partner both room to grow. Feeling low and sad is normal and a healthy part of life. All our feelings act as guiding signals. Some are more uncomfortable than others but are still very important and helpful. Low and uncomfortable feelings usually signal outdated programming that we may have picked up in our early years. With a little unlearning and relearning, we can grow and experience less intense low or uncomfortable feelings.
You’ve got this. Go one step at a time! You sound like someone with the resilience and perseverance to overcome challenges. Give yourself permission to feel not okay and okay.

Feeling like we are being judged can be very painful and as a result, might provoke some defensiveness in us so we might want to do ‘it’ back to them. It is a normal human reaction as we want to be able to protect ourselves and also stand up for ourselves. However, as parties trade judgements with each other, I wonder what is the usual outcome? And is this outcome something we want?
Perhaps, might we invite ourselves to consider why the judgments/actions of the other affect us so much? Could it be that some hidden part of us inside think that what the other person is saying might have some truth even if if isn’t so? Might there be other ways to respond to people’s judgement? For example, letting it roll off us like water off a duck’s back? Don’t mind if I just offer some food for thought.
I suppose in the end, we can’t control what others do. We can only control what we think, feel and do. Let’s take care of ourselves and our own happiness and perhaps leave others to deal with their own issues and their own problems? How does that sound to you?
Please take care and have a good week ahead!

i’m not sure if this is the right outlet to seek advice but i feel at a lost as to where my mind is at right now… i’ve been in a relationship for the past 2 years and it’s my first time being in one. i find myself being more sensitive and emotional since dating my partner - is this normal?
the main thing clogging my mind is something that happened last night. my partner and i bond through gaming and that’s how our relationship even started in the first place, we got closer through playing often with our mutual friends. not long ago, my partner mentioned that he hates playing with that mutual friend as he feels like he becomes the butt of the jokes that are made and he feels like i’m not standing up enough for him. he said that he wants to stop playing with them and said he didn’t want me to as well. what he said made me feel guilty, and i haven’t played with those mutual friends since then, though i don’t think they know that we’re avoiding them as we still talk, just not game. i also went on holiday with other friends so i haven’t been playing much anyway. during the time that i was away, my boyfriend started playing games with new friends, some that i had already knew. so when i came back, naturally i started playing with them as well. i thought that he had enjoyed playing with them - why else would he willingly join right? well, last night seemed like the last straw. while we were playing, he would message me “fun meh? do you really think this is fun?” and i just genuinely don’t know how to respond to that. this isn’t the first time he’s mentioned feeling this way to that particular game so i wasn’t surprised or anything. maybe i just felt a bit annoyed as he would constantly egg me on with
messaging “this is why i feel like im just wasting my time” to me.
this again brings me back to whether or not it’s normal for me to feel miserable over what he said or am i just being sensitive? i do enjoy playing the game but when he acts that way, obviously it takes out all the fun and i just have to put up an act in front of everyone else present. today it seems like he’s really determined to stop playing that game (this is not the first time he’s said he would stop) and when his friend invited us to play another game, i decided not to join. as soon as i thought of playing a game with my boyfriend, i immediately felt like crying again and i could only hear him saying “it feels like a waste of time” constantly ringing in my head. i brought that up to him and he assured me that he only felt that way towards that particular game so he’ll be fine playing this one. i still refused and told him that i was fine even though he didn’t seem convinced.
i genuinely do want to talk to him about this but i just dont know how to verbalize what im feeling, because i’m not sure what im feeling myself… i just feel sad and somehow scared when i feel like i shouldn’t be over something so trivial. when we meet in person, he’s always been the sweetest and most caring so this gaming thing is really the only part of our relationship that has not been optimal.
i’m sorry if my storytelling was confusing, idk how else to explain this pent-up feeling in my mind, any advice is appreciated. thanks!",,1,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out to us. We are glad that this is a good space for you to release some of your pent-up feelings. It is important to be able to share your thoughts and feelings with another person. Sometimes in the process of sharing your thoughts, things actually become clearer. Wonder if this is so for you too?
I hear that this is your first relationship and you are experiencing a mix bag of emotions which are rather confusing and upsetting for you. It is normal to feel intense emotions as you learn how to navigate a serious, exclusive relationship. It is not easy at all! You are definitely not alone in this and I want to commend you on plucking the courage to reach out to us for some help. And if you feel like crying, absolutely, please do so! No, you are too anything at all. Your feelings are valid and there are no right/wrong feelings. We don’t judge our feelings which are only signalling to us that something needs our attention.
It sounds like this relationship means a lot to you, you care much about what your boyfriend thinks and feels, and you have been trying your best to show him you care about him by following his wishes, for example, not playing certain games or with certain people he doesn’t like, but his signals are confusing to you and in some ways, feels like the goalposts keeps changing and it is not enough?
It seems too that even as you try to accommodate his wishes, you also collect some negative feelings. Feelings such as guilt because you still talk to some friends whom he doesn’t like and annoyance because it feels like he is just ‘egging you on’, among others. Above all, you feel you can’t be direct with him for fear of upsetting him, and that might make one feel trapped, frustrated or just simply upset.
So my question is, what might you want in a long term relationship? Here are some questions for you to ponder and reflect upon:
2. Would you want to have the freedom to mix with whom you want to and play the games you wish to? How much would you compromise in a relationship?
3. Would you want to be able to keep your own identity and autonomy in a relationship and have boundaries about what you want/like/don’t like etc? What are your physical/emotional/social boundaries?
4. Would you want to be able to communicate directly with your partner and be able to be yourself? What are your communication styles?
5. Would you want a partner who can be his own person and able to respect your boundaries? How would you evaluate emotional maturity?
As you take time and space to attend to your thoughts and feelings about what has been happening with your boyfriend, please do take good care of yourself. Eat well, sleep well and keeping moving (exercise).
Hope this helps!
Hugs,

I think I just replied to your other post about your father, am I right? Apologies if it is not so. Thank you for sharing more!
Yes, if you do not feel safe at any time, please call the National Anti-Violence Hotline at 1800-777-0000 (if there is abuse/violence), SOS at 1767 if you have thoughts of ending your life, or in times of emergency, call 999 or 995 as the police/ambulance are able to reach you in the shortest time possible.
It sounds like you have in place some great strategies to cope with flashbacks, times when you feel down or when you notice yourself living in the past. Journaling is a wonderful way to safely unload to a non-judgemental ‘being’ who can also help you process what has happened in the present by simply reflecting back to you. The act of writing and confiding in our journals is also known to be therapeutic to many. I wonder if you would consider also doing some mindful meditations via apps like headspace or Calm, try yoga/pilates or do mindful walks or runs?
I notice a part of you is numbed out and prefers to be by yourself. I would like to invite you (if it feels right to you) to be curious about this part and ask it why it does what it does, what it is trying to protect you from and what are its fears and concerns. My guess is that it is trying to help and protect you in some ways. But of course, this may be hard to do and if you would like to go deeper and heal, you might like to reach out to a trauma specialist or a professional counsellor who works with trauma. We have provided some contacts to you for this and hope they would be of use to you.
Take good care, Rachelle!

I currently keep relapsing abt my past relationship. My first love/my first ex. I dont know where to start but I’ll share everything here. I dont of i still cannot move on from him. I still care about him. I still stalk about him. Everyday and not even one day i miss thinking about him. Today he disable his main instagram and twitter which made me feel so sad and lonely because every day and night, i always stalk about him because i want to know his life update, how hes doing. What he thinking. And since he disable his two main socmed, i only got his life update through snapchat. I still grateful about it but still i keep think what bother him from disabled his ig and twitter. I knew his had another private acc but at the same time i understand those acc wasnt meant to be followed by me since i think he keep his life private. But somewhere i think he avoiding me. A little feeling in my mind thinking he still love me even a little. I knew he still care about me. But i’m afraid im just being delusional. I feel sorry to my current boyfriend for keeping someone else in my heart. Its been 4 years already and i still cant stop thinking about him. Do i considered as crazy? Attachement issue? Afraid of abandonment? I just want to be loved. My parents divorced since i was 3. I live with foster grandparent. I dont have foster parent. And i growing up with lacks of love and attention. No one really cared about me. And since he the first one who cared about me and that the first time i fell in love and the longest relay i had. He broke up with me because he lost feeling. I have no clue why. Everything just doing great that time, i got someone who loves me, who cared about me, but suddenly my wolrd just crashed, my heart ripped apart. And it affects me until today.

Thank you for being so vulnerable and sharing your struggles with us. I want to acknowledge the depth of your emotions and the pain you’re experiencing right now. It takes a lot of courage to open up about such vulnerable feelings. I hear that you’re grappling with a complex mix of emotions, memories, and longing from your past relationship.
It’s completely normal to have lingering feelings for a first love, especially when it was an important part of your life. It could also be that the impact of your parents’ divorce and growing up with a lack of love and attention may be contributing to the intensity of these emotions.
Your attachment to your first love and the difficulty moving on could indeed be connected to your early experiences of love and attachment. It’s very normal for past wounds to resurface in our current relationships, and it seems like he was a source of care and attention at a crucial time in your life, and losing that connection has left a lasting impact on you.
I want to affirm you that your feelings are valid, and you’re not alone in experiencing them. The fear of abandonment and the desire for love are powerful emotions that can be rooted in our early experiences.
Considering the complexity of your emotions, perhaps it could be good to seek support from a therapist, who can provide a safe space for you to explore and understand these feelings, help you process your current relationship, and work towards finding a sense of closure and peace. I also think it could be possible for you to process the grief that you’re experiencing at the same time.
I also want to encourage you, the fact that you’re aware of the impact on your current relationship is commendable. Perhaps it would be good to have open communication with your current boyfriend about your struggles and seeking professional support together could strengthen your relationship. You both can talk to a relationship therapist who can also help you to process these struggles together as a couple.

Some context:
I feel like I’ve recently been dealing with alot of self doubt and at times feel alone and anxious. I’ve tried to ground myself when I can sense that I’m feeling anxious (ie: increased heart rate and like slight tightness of the heart) but I’m just afraid in the long run I might not be able to control or it may get worse.
A couple of weeks back I also had thoughts of what it felt like to drown and even further back last year had thoughts of what it would feel like to get hit by a car. I don’t think its suicidal but I don’t know why when things are down for me it sometimes lead to those thoughts.
I don’t really want to tell anyone close to me like my family as 1) I don’t want them to worry and 2) I feel like its hard for them to understand as well.
Been to councilling at SAMH before last year for about 5 sessions thus knowing some grounding techniques but it ended after 5 sessions as at that point of time I thought I was ok afterwards. However these negative thoughts and feelings of self doubt and worry seem to be resurfacing and I’m afraid it would get worse.

It sounds incredibly tough to be experiencing all of this.
I’m grateful that you’ve chosen to share your feelings here. It shows great strength and courage to open up about what you’re going through. It sounds incredibly tough to manage these overwhelming thoughts and feelings.
Emotions are powerful signals that our bodies use to communicate with us. They’re meant to guide us and help us understand our needs. When we ignore them, they can become even louder and more distressing. As Brené Brown aptly puts it, “Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it.” Well done on reaching out for support and being brave to explore yourself further.
Here are a few things you might consider:
2. Seek Professional Help: Talking to a therapist or counsellor can provide a safe space to explore these feelings without judgment. They can help you understand what you’re going through and develop strategies to cope.
3. Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself. It’s natural to feel guilt and inadequacy during difficult times, but remember that you deserve understanding and support just like everyone else.
4. Take Small Steps: Break things down into smaller, manageable parts. Start with reaching out to someone you trust, even if it’s just to share how you’re feeling. You don’t have to figure everything out at once.
5. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can sometimes help to organise and process them. Here are some journal prompts to consider:
How do I feel physically and emotionally right now?
What are the main sources of stress or anxiety in my life at the moment?
What small achievements or positive moments have I experienced recently?
How do my emotions influence my interactions with others?
What are some things I can do today to take care of myself?
6. How do I feel physically and emotionally right now?
7. What are the main sources of stress or anxiety in my life at the moment?
8. What small achievements or positive moments have I experienced recently?
9. How do my emotions influence my interactions with others?
10. What are some things I can do today to take care of myself?
11. Self-Care: Find activities that bring you comfort and peace, whether it’s going for a walk, listening to music, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness. Here are some quick self-regulation skills I’d like you to practice whenever you notice your emotions stirring up strongly again. Try these calming strategies:
- How do I feel physically and emotionally right now?
- What are the main sources of stress or anxiety in my life at the moment?
- What small achievements or positive moments have I experienced recently?
- How do my emotions influence my interactions with others?
- What are some things I can do today to take care of myself?
- Deep Breathing: Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body.
- Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Start from your toes and work your way up, tensing and then slowly relaxing each muscle group in your body. This can help release physical tension associated with stress.
- Grounding Techniques: Use your senses to connect with the present moment. Focus on things you can see, hear, touch, smell, and taste to anchor yourself in the here and now.
It’s okay to ask for help and to take things one step at a time. You deserve support and understanding as you navigate through this challenging time.

But the thing is, I think they’re going to leave me anytime soon (I’ve known them for years, so I doubt that, but still), and I have this thought in my head that keeps saying to push them away and cut them from my life, but I just can’t do that, and it all goes away when I’m talking and chuckling to them, then comes back after a few hours.
I’ve told my close friends about this, but they just don’t seem to care or understand how I feel. I don’t vent to others because I’ll feel guilty afterwards, and I mostly bottle them up. Every time my close friends talk to someone else, I become upset and jealous. Then I feel like no one wants me, and I start crying.

Thank you for coming here to share your feelings with us. It sounds like you’re going through a really tough time right now, and I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way.
It’s clear that these mood swings and intense emotions are taking a toll on you. Emotions play a crucial role as signals from our inner selves, letting us know when something needs attention. When we ignore these signals, they often intensify, making it harder to manage our feelings. If your feelings could speak, what would they say?
I’m glad to hear that you’ve reached out to your close friends, although it can be incredibly frustrating when they don’t seem to understand or respond in the way you hope. Friends may not always have the training or skills to listen well and attune to your emotions in the same way a professional can.
Feeling like no one likes you or that your friends might leave can be overwhelming, especially when you know deep down that these thoughts might not reflect reality. It’s great that you can still find moments of joy and connection with your friends, even if those feelings of insecurity return later.
I’ve shared a link here for you to follow up on more professional support. You may want to do some self-assessments to gain an idea of what you may be experiencing, especially if depression is a concern or if it might be something else. Seeking help from a counsellor or therapist can provide you with a supportive and non-judgmental space to explore these feelings further and to learn effective strategies to manage them.
It is possible to feel happy again with the right and support. It’s okay to seek help and to take steps towards feeling better. You don’t have to go through this alone.
In the meantime, here are some quick self-regulation skills I’d recommend practicing whenever you notice your emotions stirring up strongly again.
2. Deep Breathing: Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose, hold briefly, and then exhale slowly through your mouth with a sigh. Repeat several times to help calm your mind and body.
3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Tense and then relax each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. This technique helps release physical tension associated with stress.
4. Mindfulness or Meditation: Take a few minutes to focus on the present moment. You can do this by paying attention to your breath, observing your surroundings, or practicing a guided meditation. This can help bring a sense of calm and clarity.
Practicing these techniques regularly can support you in managing intense emotions and finding a greater sense of balance.

13345,cheated on,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/cheated-on/13345,Seeking Help,needadvice,10926,heheheha,User,,20575,1,"hello! i’ll just start of by explaining what happened, sorry if my english isn’t very good.
i was in a relationship with my boyfriend of 5 months up till today when i broke it off. we knew each other from some online dating thing. i started getting to know him from october 2023 and we started dating late january 2024. throughout the talking stage period, i think it was mutual that we liked each other, we got along well and everything. i believed our personalities were similar. we had similar music taste and humour and basically everything else you know. i also initiated getting intimate with him first… (now that i think about it i did i too soon but oh well) and i think i had a few arguments with him about other girls he was still talking to as we weren’t exclusive yet. i was only talking to him as i cut off everyone else except for him hahaha. anyways we were happy for the first 2 months i think.
then started the arguing. i think maybe over the few months i could see his true colours. he was quite narcissistic and only cared for himself, no empathy, that sort of thing. he didn’t know how to put himself in my shoes at all. but i was pretty irritable all the time, and i just didn’t understand him at all. when i explained to him that he has to change to work things out with me, he just said “oh it’s just him” and that “it doesn’t really matter” i’m stupid because i literally just brushed it off. this happened multiple times again by the way. it was really draining. i just felt so lost because i love him and i believed he loved me too, so it was all going to be okay.
then came like maybe 3 days ago. we got into another fight because he was calling other girls “pretty” “have potential” and oohing and ahing in front of me, and i was clearly pissed hahaha… i just straight up asked him to stop and to apologise to me but he just didn’t take me seriously. it was quite immature of me but i blocked him everywhere after that. i felt that i let what he do slide so many times so he’s okay with treating me badly, so i should set my boundary and not let him do so.
he was blocked, he didn’t try to contact me or anything, i felt he didn’t care at all. when i unblocked him earlier today, he texted me asking if we were going to talk. then i said yeah and just initiated some small talk but he was dry. then i just said i was still angry and stuff, and asked if he even wanted to resolve it with me. he said blocking wouldn’t make him care at all so i said okay and just said some mean stuff to him.
at night i was just scrolling his instagram and i found a new girl he was following, i contacted her and found out he was flirting with her. like even before the argument i think. the girl didn’t know and apologised to me. it really wasn’t her fault. i texted my boyfriend about it and he just said what he is supposed to say as we weren’t working out. i just said why would you do it behind my back and just said i didn’t think he’d be that low of a person. i asked him to mail back my things to me and yeah.
so about how i feel, i just didn’t expect him to do me dirty like that. i just wanted him to care about us and want to fix things. i think that maybe he was too tired of arguing all the time that he just decided to talk to other girls. but behind my back just really hurts. it’s like what we had wasn’t real at all and it just sucks right now. he cheat on me, i’m not even sure is it my fault or his. i’m just very lost and i don’t know what to do right now. sorry if this is so long…",,0,,,,,
13345,cheated on,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/cheated-on/13345,Seeking Help,needadvice,7296,CoolBreeze,Professional,Professional,20589,2,"Hello @heheheha ,
It sounds like you’ve been through a lot lately, and it makes sense to feel hurt and confused. It’s never easy to end a relationship, especially when you’ve invested time and emotions into it.
From what you’ve shared, it seems like you genuinely cared about your boyfriend and wanted things to work out. It’s tough when you start noticing differences and arguments start happening. It’s important to remember that it’s healthy to set boundaries and expect respect in a relationship.
Discovering that he was flirting with someone else behind your back must have been really painful. Feeling betrayed and questioning what you had is completely normal. Please know that his actions are not your fault or responsibility. Relationships should be built on trust and mutual respect, and it’s clear you were trying to communicate and make things work. Yes, there is room to improve your communication and conflict resolution skills but that doesn’t mean taking on the responsibility of his share of the relationship breaking down.
After a breakup, it can be helpful to take time for some self-reflection. Here are some journal prompts for your consideration:
- What were the best moments you shared?
This can give you an insight into what you like and want more of in your next relationship
- What were the biggest challenges?
- How did you feel when you discovered he was flirting with someone else?
- What emotions are you experiencing now?
- What are your non-negotiables in a relationship?
- How can you communicate these effectively in the future?
- What have you learned about yourself from this experience?
- How can you use this knowledge to build healthier relationships in the future?
- How much do you value yourself and your needs in a relationship?
- Reflect on what stopped you from recognising the red flags earlier.
- Are there still red flags you can identify now?
- What does your ideal relationship look like?
- How much of what you want in a relationship are you currently meeting for yourself?-
- Reflect on times when you accepted poor treatment from others.
- What were the circumstances surrounding those situations?
- How did you feel during those times?
- How did your own sense of self-love and self-respect influence your decisions and reactions?
Self-love is about understanding how the way you treat yourself influences your relationships with others. When you nurture a positive relationship with yourself, it naturally enhances how you connect with those around you. Healthy relationships thrive when we focus on fulfilling our own needs rather than trying to change others. Remember, you are only responsible for your own actions and emotions, which is key to fostering supportive and fulfilling connections with others.
Take some time to focus on yourself and your own well-being. Surround yourself with supportive friends or family members who can listen and offer comfort. Reflecting on what you’ve learned from this experience can also help you grow stronger and make better choices in the future.
If you find yourself struggling with these emotions, consider talking to a trusted adult or a counsellor who can provide guidance and support.
You deserve to be treated with kindness and respect in any relationship. Thank you for coming here to share your feelings with us. Take things one step at a time, and it’s okay to take some time for healing

I am so sorry to hear about your losses and the abuse and trauma you have endured in the span of the last few months! The compounded pain and trauma must have been overwhelming to say the least. I wonder who else knows about what you have experienced? How have you been coping? Losing both your first love and best friend on top of trauma and abuse can leave you feeling isolated, devastated and in despair. For you to still be able to fight on, to try and move on, and cope is really admirable and demonstrates just how much resilience and strength lies within you. I really want to commend you on that. What’s more you are able to look for avenues of help and have the courage to reach out and share your struggles, that is just admirable!
I want to begin with asking first and foremost if you are safe right now? I am mindful that you shared about trauma and physical abuse which ‘almost ruined my (your) life’. May I please ask if you might still be experiencing any abuse at all? If you are, please know that you are not alone and there is help available! Please call the National Anti-violence Hotline at 1800-777-0000, should you be or should you ever be in danger again.
Secondly, the nature of trauma is such that fragmented parts of ourselves gets stuck back there back then, and our body gets stuck in re-enactments and in survival mode, whether that be fight, flight, freeze, fawn/please and so on. It’s like a broken record that is stuck at one part of a song, unable to go on. Thus, what you are describing about not being able to stay in the present is indicative of the body’s trauma response. The fact that you are aware of and desirous of moving on is good insight and a step in the right direction although I’d imagine your frustration at not being able to move on fast enough. May I encourage you to be patient with yourself and extend truckloads of love and compassion on yourself as you amble along on your healing and recovery journey.
Recovering from trauma is a complex process and often it might be essential to seek professional help. Here are some steps you can consider to aid in your recovery:
2. Safety and Stabilization:
- Ensure physical safety and create a stable environment
- Establish routines and healthy coping mechanisms such as regular sleep routines, eating well and exercising regularly
3. Seek Trauma-informed Professional Support:
- Therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), EMDR, Brainspotting, Internal Family Systems Therapy or other trauma-focused therapy can be helpful
- Be open to consider medication: Antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed if necessary
4. Self-Care and Coping Strategies:
- Practice mindfulness, deep breathing, and grounding techniques
- Engage in activities you enjoy and connect with supportive people.
5. Building Resilience:
- Strengthen emotional resilience through self-compassion and self-care

Not sure if i was reading into others comments too deeply or too sensitive.
Seemed like comments coming from ppl around made me feel undesirable and small.
I felt noone actually understands me. They judged me based on what they assumed. And they dont listen to my explanations. Not even my own family or my spouse. I tried explaining but noone wants to listen. I got cut off immediately.
When i stopped explaining, they will say why i did not raise it up.
I am lost. I dont know whats required anymore. I felt life is meaningless.
Noone is actually listening
Noone.
When decisions lies on me, things go wrong, i got questioned why it turned the wrong way. Nth is perfect. I cannot guarantee everything is perfect.
I dont expect everyone to be too. There are bound to be flaws and all.
I now have noone to talk to or discuss abt issues i faced in my life. Cos whenever i bring up, i get comments that i an negative and i brought it upon myself. And thats too bad cos ur lousy. So thats quite normal.",,2,,,,,

I have also felt the same in that I’d want to explain and confide in somebody, but it often feels as if there’s practically no one who just wants to listen to me.
One way I cope from these kinds of scenarios is by practicing - Social Distancing. It can be either literally by leaving the place and moving to a calmer environment, or “shutting off” their comments from entering my headspace.
While the latter may seem easier said than done, one way I use to practise it is by listening to positive influences like a motivational talk or just the radio. Listening to the radio had helped me a lot as it has prevented me from contemplating on their thoughts every now and then, as the RJs introduce new discussion topics that may broaden my perspective . When compared to the problem, those topics of discussions often increase my brain activity especially in times when I felt like contemplating about any problem I was facing.
Secondly, I feel you would benefit from some positive re-affirmations. It may seem as if we are the ones causing too much problems especially when we get rather sensitive to others comments. I feel the vulnerability is what that brings us the strength. When harnessed properly, it can prove as a stepping stone to our success. However, that doesn’t mean that we have to be too harsh on ourselves. We have to embrace our personality and strike the right balance between being critical and sensitive.
Hope this helps!",,2,,,,,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us and sharing your innermost thoughts and feelings with us. That must have taken you a lot of courage. Just want to commend you on that. It is not easy to be vulnerable like that.
The feeling I am getting from reading your post is a deep sense of loneliness, shame and judgement. You must be hurting a lot inside. You are not alone, okay? We are here for you; listening to you and being with you. It seems that you desire love and belonging like every one of us does, and you have tried your best to connect with the people around you but no one seems to be reciprocating to you in loving and respectful ways. That is so painful to bear all by yourself. Sometimes when we have been feeling that way for a long time, life indeed can begin to feel quite meaningless.
Ethel, just want to check for your safety at this point, sometimes when people feel that life is meaningless, hopeless and worthless, they might have thoughts of ending their life or escaping in some way. Wonder if that has ever crossed your mind? Apologies if that is not so, I am just concerned for your safety and want to make sure you are safe. Do reach out to SOS at 1767 or message them at Caretext: https://www.sos.org.sg/ if you need someone to talk to at anytime.
You are worthy and loved, Ethel. In fact, your name means noble, am I right? You are definitely of great value! Hope that in your journey of self-love and self-discovery, you’d realise just how wonderful and precious you are. As a first step, wonder how you feel about looking yourself in the mirror and giving yourself a high 5? It might feel a tad silly but try it, won’t you?
Take care, Ethel.",https://www.sos.org.sg/ https://www.sos.org.sg/,1,,,,,

But yes, at times i do feel life is quite meaningless. I do feel being unfairly treated most of the time. Having to juggle as a working mom and not having the kind of support or understanding its really mental draining. I dont even have time to cry.
Recently cant even communicate with my spouse as he will also judge me like others. Worst of all, when u hear comments about how i am not doing enough as a mother. If my kids misbehave, the fault lies in having a mother like me. Its like i am always not doing enough. Most of the issues at home are also being handled by me. I felt overwhelmed.
I want to build on my career (which i have delayed for many yr as my kids were still young) yet had to balance out at home. My current job now is very hectic.
End of the day, i am always mentally and physically tired that i dont even have the energy or motivation to speak to anyone. I will then indulge in watching dramas.
I ever thought of taking my kids with me to somewhere where we dont know anyone. They are the only ones who wouldn’t judge me and i felt really bad not giving them enough attention. I felt they dont deserve a mother like me.
I felt really lost. When i ask for help, i get comments that i am WEAK. So i had to keep it to myself. Not sure how long it can last.",,1,,,,,

It is so very isolating and lonely to do so much, not be appreciated and worse, blamed when things go wrong. You are truly not alone. Many mothers/wives struggle with the same thoughts, emotions and challenges. One bright spark in your life seems to be your children. They seem to be really close to you. How old are they? How are they doing? I read somewhere that we, mothers, tend to be so very hard on ourselves and tend to feel we have not done enough but often, our children think the world of us and really enjoy the times we have ‘failed’. When I say that, I am thinking of the times when we feel tired, don’t want to cook and we all eat instant noodles in front of the TV. To us, we might think that we have not served good and healthy food and feel like we are encouraging bad habits but to them, wow, it could be quite a treat! I can sense how much you love your children so I want to tell you that you are a good mother. You are a good mother because you are still there despite all the challenges and all the difficulties. You are a good mother because you have been working hard to raise them and you work hard both at work and at home to support the family! You are a good mother because you feel bad and worry that what you have given is not good enough. But honestly, it is enough that our children know that we love them and we are trying our best and that, I feel, you are! Hugs
One thing mothers could do better - tongue in cheek - is put ourselves first, is to take care of ourselves first. Cliche though it might sound, it is true that we need to put the oxygen mask on ourselves first before attending to our children. In fact, it is not only true, it is absolutely critical. So, I would like to gently encourage you @ethel to take good care of yourself and put the guilt aside when you schedule time for yourself to res, to watch kdrama, to exercise, to spa, to meet your friends and yes (!) to spend time and money upgrading yourself and building your career. You are also a human being with needs, feelings, dreams and aspirations. Will you choose one little thing to do for yourself today/tomorrow? Start with a small thing. Any small thing that might bring joy or comfort or a little smile to your face, okay?
Remember, @ethel, you are a good mother and you have value, are worthy and loved. Take very good care of yourself! Hugs, @northernlights",,0,,,,,

Tks for the encouragement
My children are 12 and 8.
Oldest one is a girl and gg thru psle this year. Her results are not that ideal, so its becoming quite worrisome.
And at the same time we will be moving to a new plc this yr. Things had been really overwhelming.
Recently my boy also had some academic issues. Thats when it added on my worries and think what have i not done enough or done wrongly. Tks for reminding me that i have been a good mother. And i tried my best. I do keep telling myself on this. But fell bk on negative thous when i couldn’t breathe.
Work also taken a great toll on my mind. Cos i was promoted last yr and my boss is expecting a whole lot more from me. My mind was full of my work… and what could turn wrong. I was juggling 3 projects and had to cover 2 of my colleagues (1 resigned and 1 on long medical leave). Despite telling my boss abt this, i was being told that one of my projects is a disaster and mess. I am very demoralised as well. I started questioning myself if i deserved the promotion. My boss is a narcissist and cuts me off whenever i tried explaining. Thank god that she is being deployed to somewhere else and will be a brand new person nx mth onwards. I hope things will turn out better.
All these added on to become anxiety.
It kicks in when stress suddenly spikes. And comes with gastric pains. Whenever this happens, i dont talk. I cant talk. My mood kicks in as well. I feel irritated for the slightest things. I just hope it will not turn into anxiety attacks one day. Recently felt some chest pains. The feel was on and off. Not sure whats it but im still afraid to visit the doctor or should i say i dont really have the time. Sad.",,0,,,,,

Thank you so much for writing in to us and sharing with us your struggles and emotions. I hear that you are feeling trapped and somewhat confused regarding some of your friends who are supposed to be ‘Best Friends’. It takes a lot of courage to open up to total strangers online and about something so close and personal to you so I really want to commend you on your bravery and openness.
Friendships can be really hard to navigate in general but especially so during teenage years when emotions are intense, social dynamics are complex and self-discovery is in full swing. Sending you compassion and hugs! Let’s take this apart bit by bit, okay?
‘Can’t be myself’
Feeling like you can’t be yourself around your ‘best friends’ can feel incredibly isolating and disheartening. It’s like wearing a mask and pretending to fit into a mould that doesn’t truly represent who you are. You might fear judgement, rejection or losing these connection. The weight of maintaining this façade can be so very exhausting and it often leads to a sense of loneliness even in the company of others. Remember, true friendships allow you to be authentic and accept you for who you are. If you constantly feel the need to talk or act a certain way, it could explain why you have been feeling increasingly trapped and feeling like ‘something is not right’. How long, I wonder, do you think you could handle being in this situation where you can’t be yourself?
Something is not right
Our emotions are like signals to us, sharing wisdom with us and directing our attention to certain things which may be significant or requires attention. They allow us to evaluate what matters to us in our lives, in this case, your relationship with your friends. It seems like they are presently telling you something is not right, something is off. I wonder if I could invite you to sit a little bit with these feelings and become curious about what wisdom it has to share with you? So far, it seems to be reminding you of a past experience which perhaps feels familiar to you? What happened in the past? Do you note the similarities/differences between then and now? What emotions and feelings did you feel then? Does it feel familiar? I would like to encourage you to take a notebook and jot down your response to these questions and invite this part of you that feels strongly that something is not right to share more with you its story, what it wants you to know and what it needs from you. Have a little conversation with this part if you will and get to know it well because our emotions have much wisdom to share with us and will keep intimating to us until we heed it.
Trapped
When we feel trapped, we might sometimes feel a whole range of feelings that can be overwhelming. If we are trapped in a lift that has broken down, for example, we might first try our best to get help or find a way out which is akin to you trying various things such as being nice, being mean etc. But when nothing seems to work, one might start to feel a sense of helplessness, hopelessness, despair, anger, sadness, frustration and so on. It can be a terribly lonely and challenging experience.
In your case, it seems like you feel trapped and have mixed feelings about your friends. On one hand, you say they are ‘great’ but then you also feel like they treat you differently, they talk bad about you and nothing you do seems to ‘work’. It seems to me, and I could be wrong, there is a part of you that wants to remain connected to these friends and believe that they are really your best friends but yet there is another part of you waving the red flag frantically telling you no, something is wrong, they aren’t quite your friends. Am I right? If so, it is no wonder you feel trapped and stuck between a hard place and a rock because both parts are strong, vocal and vying for your attention and who can blame you, they both make so much sense, right?
May I suggest you take some time to ‘talk’ to these two parts individually? Take a piece of paper and write to the ‘Best friends’ part and ask it:
- What does it want to share with you?
- Why these friends are so important for you?
- What are its fears and concerns?
- What does it need from you?
- Anything else it wants to share with you?
And then, do likewise for the part that says something is off and ask it:
- What does it want to share with you?
- Tell you more about the memory it wants you to remember
- What wisdom/insights does it want to share with you from the past?
- What are its fears and concerns?
- What does it need from you?
- Anything else it wants to share with you?
Just write freely and since it is really only for your eyes only, just scribble away. See what comes up for you and hopefully, you will have greater clarity at the end of it. Of course, you could also do this exercise with a trained counsellor who might be able to hold space for you and enable you to process deeper and safely.

Thank you for sharing openly about your feelings and what had happened to you. It takes so much courage to come on here and share something so personal and vulnerable. You are so brave! Really want to affirm your courage and willingness to share and seek support.
I’m so sorry to hear that at this recent sleepover, you experienced a sudden and complete change from being happy, comfortable and regulated to being extremely anxious and dysregulated. In fact, things got so bad for you that you decided to leave the sleepover prematurely. I imagine that experiencing this sudden anxiety attack might have been incredibly distressing and possibly overwhelming for you. Yet, you maintained enough composure to make the best decision for yourself in that situation which was to leave the sleepover. That’s no mean feat! Kudos to you! It is perfectly alright to do what makes us feel better in such situations. I am curious, Jan1, what happened after you left? Wonder if you managed to have some time to yourself to reflect about (a) what had happened, (b) what happened prior to the anxiety attack and (c) what happened after? If you have not, could I encourage you to perhaps journal these down? Sometimes in doing so, we might gain greater insight into ourselves and what happened.
Further, I want to affirm you that your feelings are all valid – the anxiousness, the strong feeling of wanting to cry, overthinking and feeling flustered and desire to leave. They are all valid. I also want to encourage you that it’s totally okay to cry. Crying is one of the many ways that we express and release our emotions and it can be very therapeutic. Wonder if you did in fact cry after you left the sleepover? Could I also ask if this was the first time this (anxiety attack) has happened? If this is not the first time, when was the first time it happened, and could you recall what was going on at that time? How often do you experience these anxiety attacks and how do you usually cope with them? Wonder if you have confided in anyone about what you experienced? Sometimes having supportive friends and family can help us a great deal.
Next time you experience an anxiety attack, perhaps you could try out some mindfulness strategies to calm yourself down. Here are some examples that you can try out that might help : https://mindline.sg/online-chatbot/self-care-exercises?category=mindfulness-practice 6
Most importantly, please do focus on taking care of yourself. Self-care can be broken down into several parts.
Physical health: Do eat well, sleep well and do some regular walking or exercise.
Mental and emotional health: Engage in mindfulness activities, try some meditation, yoga/pilates, breathing exercises like box breathing or the physiological sigh, or explore apps like Calm or Headspace and maybe start journaling
Social connection: reach out and connect with supportive people in your life whom you feel safe with and can confide in

During Easter period ( April) I started getting panick attacks and bad anxiety ( and I’ve never gotten it before). I started seeing the counselling serving at the uni, and getting support from friends and mainly my boyfriend. I’ve now returned back to SG for summer and we won’t see each other until September. I’m having a really hard time being apart from him, I haven’t been eating, and I don’t enjoy doing things I used to enjoy doing. Even though we call, I feel like I’ve lost my support system since he’s so far away. I have troubles being left on my own, because my thoughts start to send me in a spiral.

Thank you for coming on here to share what you have been experiencing. I’m sorry to hear that you feel that you’ve lost your support system which you have found in your boyfriend and that even though you guys still call each other to communicate, it is not enough. The long distance between the us and someone we rely on a lot can be really hard on our mental and emotional well-being, even more so when we have some existing anxiety. Please know that you are not alone and that there are ways to manage and overcome these feelings.
First things first, please do ensure that you are taking good care of your physical health by trying your best to eat well, maintain good sleep hygiene and incorporate lots of movement into your routine such as regular exercise or walking. If you are able to practice mindfulness such as mindfulness meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation or various breathing techniques such as physiological breathing, that might also be helpful for you.
Secondly, I wonder if you have friends and family here in Singapore whom you are able to confide in? Just as you had found good support from your friends in the UK, would you perhaps you be able to access similar here at home? Sometimes when we open up to people whom we feel safe with, it makes us feel less alone and it could make the distance and seemingly long time apart from your boyfriend more manageable.
Thirdly, I wonder if you have shared how you feel with your boyfriend. Besides calling, would it be possible to brainstorm some other ways of connecting online for the next three months or so? Some possible suggestions are video chats, online multi-player games, planning what you guys can do when you meet each other again in September, if both of you are still studying, you might even do a fun online course together such as learning a new language, art, learn a new instrument or whatever might interest both of you. How about giving good old letter writing a try or keeping a journal of your thoughts and feelings which you can share with him from time to time? You may also consider planning some sweet surprises for him (one per week, per month?) and vice versa. Putting in effort to keep the communication going, reassuring each other, being vulnerable with each other and having fun together despite the distance may not only assuage your anxiety and fears, it might also spice up your relationship a little! As they say, ‘absence makes the heart fonder’! Perhaps, there is some truth in that!
Last but not least, you mentioned that you are not able to eat, do not seem to enjoy things which you used to and your mind tends to spiral when you are alone. Wonder if you could share what you have been doing to cope with these symptoms? Are there specific strategies, ideas or techniques which your university counsellor have shared with you and worked before? If so, may I encourage you to try them out while here in Singapore. Also, as an aside, I am not sure if it would be possible to reach out to your university counsellor via email or whatsapp?
If, however, the above suggestions are not helpful to you, you could consider talking to a therapist or counsellor. They can help you understand the root causes of your low mood and anxiety and work with you to develop customised strategies to manage it.

i’m sorry to hear that you’re going through a tough time right now, and it’s really good that you’re reaching out for support. It’s important to remember that feeling anxious or low at times, especially during challenging situations, is completely normal. These feelings don’t necessarily mean you have a disorder. Anxiety and uncomfortable feelings can be a natural response to stress, signalling that something needs your attention or that you’re facing something important.
A good first step is to be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion. Understand that everyone makes mistakes and has bad days. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend in your situation. It can also be really helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or counsellor about what you’re experiencing. Sometimes just sharing your thoughts can make a big difference. When we share our thoughts and feelings, we engage our meta-cognitive skills and it helps the emotions to feel a little less intense.
Please also take care of your physical health by getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising. These can all positively impact your mental health. Practices like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga can help you manage stress and anxiety. Breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable steps can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed. Try to focus on your own progress and achievements rather than comparing yourself to others, as everyone has their own unique path.
You mentioned feeling like the world is here to tackle and punish you for your wrongdoings. Can you share more about why you feel this way? Understanding the root of these thoughts might help you find better ways to cope with them.
The feelings of stubbornness, restlessness, and fatigue at work can be signs of an inner child response, where past experiences influence your current behaviour. Recognising this can help you address the root cause. Acknowledge and validate your feelings, understanding that they might be stemming from past experiences. When you feel stubborn or restless, remind yourself of your current capabilities and strengths as an adult. Use positive affirmations to counter negative self-talk. Engage in activities that help you manage stress and anxiety, such as journaling, creative hobbies, or spending time with loved ones. These can help you feel more grounded and in control.
If your feelings of anxiety and depression persist, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide you with strategies and support tailored to your situation.
It’s okay to ask for help, and taking steps to address your feelings is a sign of strength. You don’t have to go through this alone. I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!
Take care,

Therefore, please refrain from reading this post if you are faint hearted.
- Ever since I graduated from primary school I had been told by my parents that I was to be in charge of my education. I was told that I can decide whether or not I required tuition for a particular subject. But here’s the catch: I was not able to ask for assessment books, simply because when I was in primary school I had many assessment books which I had been left incomplete. Hence, being rational my parents said I could request for anything other than assessment books. In sec 1, I was enrolled in a tuition for math and English.
- One year later, though my performance for math was satisfactory, my grades for English were not as expected. Hence I was given an option to once again take ownership of my education as to whether or not I required tuition for English. Being rational, I said that it was wise to discontinue my English tuition simply because it’s not effective. When asked what my plan for the rest of secondary school was, I said that I just required more practice which could be obtained through the purchase of an assessment book for English.
- After sec 2, my parents said that they had enough trying to save my English grades and enrolled me in a tuition class for English. Surprisingly, I had entered triple science class and since I felt that I lacked finesse in Physics, I requested for a tuition for physics. Total number of tuitions that I was enrolled in: 3
- I went on and off for tuitions for several subjects and had to attend remedial lessons for almost every subject in school. And, phew I passed O Levels enough to get into an engineering course in poly.
- After consulting various friends and relatives, my parents decided that it was better for me to get into common engineering as I had more time to decide my specialisation. Well, I decided I like BME but after Y1 I got into RM.
- After studying for 2 years in Y2 due to certain health reasons, I am finally, now in Y3 final sem. And honestly, it feels like it is only now that I am able to have better control over my education simply bcos I can spend close to 10 hrs daily, away from home.
Now the problem is: What next?
- I have been suffering from numerous sleepless nights, panic attacks, headaches, backaches, emotional meltdowns, etcetera. The fun fact is that everyone I’m sharing the house with are going through similar emotions, but they just cannot seem to find a way to rectify this situation. Ever since the covid pandemic in 2020, the situation at “home” is getting from bad to worse.
- Big questions that I have now are:
o Am I depressed?
o Am I burnt out?
o Is this issue worth all the fuss?
o How can I get out of this situation?
Hope to get proper guidance with how I can go about handling this situation. Thank You in advance.",,2,16423.0,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to share with us your struggles, I’m truly sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing, and I can see that you’ve been through a lot in terms of your education and personal well-being. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and experiencing various physical and emotional symptoms.
I want to acknowledge the toll that this situation is taking on your mental health. The questions you’re asking yourself—whether you’re depressed, burnt out, and if this issue is worth the fuss—are valid concerns. However, it might be beneficial for you to speak with a mental health professional who can provide a more personalized assessment and support, as I am unable to do this assessment online. I would highly suggest that you reach out to a counsellor in your school or a counsellor from a nearby Family Service Centre and process your thoughts and feelings together.
In the meantime, please do consider reaching out to someone you trust, like a friend or family member, to share your feelings. Sometimes, expressing your thoughts can be a relief and open the door for support. Additionally, if the situation at home is worsening and affecting your well-being, it might be helpful to explore ways to create a healthier living environment or to seek external support.
Balancing education, personal well-being, and the challenges of daily life can be very demanding and tiring, and it’s okay to seek help! Your mental health is a priority, so please remember to take care of yourself. I encourage you to seek professional help as it can provide you with specific strategies to cope with stress, anxiety, and overwhelming feelings for your situation.
Remember, you don’t have to walk through this alone, and seeking support is a sign of strength! Take small steps to care for yourself. Let us know if you’ve reached out to anyone, and keep us updated on how you’re doing.

I just wanted to give some recent updates and my opinion with regards to your recommendation.
It’s Uni application season, and yet again the routine problem came back - asking for recommendations from others.
this time I played the game differently. Instead of being stuck in another dilemma, I predicted the problems and started finding solutions before hand -
to be exact from the start of 2020. Having encountered the problems with deciding on my post-secondary study path, I researched about various courses and
job openings they could possibly lead to before hand. Now, I am rather well educated on my possible opportunies and well prepared. I have drafted a few essays
for Apptidude-Based-Applications, scholarships and also have started saving up for Uni accommodation.
the thing now is convincing my parents. Once again, they have started rocking the boat. this time with higher severity.
I have even applied to NUS, and am in the midst of applying for NTU, which is my preferred choice. I am optimistic about getting into my first choice in NTU
thanks to my intern and FYP.
the thing is that, my parents each come from difficult backgrounds. My father lost his father - the sole-breadwinner - at an age of 17. My maternal granfather had to support his cousin’s family along with his family.
I can understand these insecurities but they use their insecurities to intimidate me per se. they keep on reinstating the need to have backup career plans which is a good thing. But they also unknowingly tend to discourage me from reaching my ambitions. to be exact I’m punched Black-eye by reality.
this time I am assertive of getting into my preferred course in my uni of choice. It’s just that I’m finding it difficult to ignore their negative remarks.
I also find that reaching out to the Family service centre may be quite difficult to resolve this situation given the urgency of this matter.
Currently, the biggest elephant in the room is applying for Uni. Any suggestions to get through this phase?
Thanks once again for your earlier reply. Looking forward for a reply to this post too.",,2,,,,,

Thanks for the update! It’s good to heat that things have progressed from the last post. After reading your post, I can imagine how it’s like to feel conflicted when facing resistance from your parents, especially when you’re pursuing your dreams.
It sounds like your parents’ concerns stem from their own difficult backgrounds and experiences. It’s actually very common for parents to project their fears and insecurities onto their children, even if it’s unintentional - this happens a lot in our Asian culture I guess. I want to encourage you that although it’s important to acknowledge and respect their perspective, it’s also important to prioritize your own goals and ambitions
I’m glad that you’re attempting to assert your confidence in your abilities by choosing a path forward! Remember, you’ve worked hard to earn your internships and complete your FYP, which speaks volumes about your dedication and capabilities. You must trust in your strengths and accomplishments as you go through this phase of applying to universities Believe in yourself!
I can also imagine that dealing with negative remarks from loved ones can be emotionally taxing. It might help to set some healthy boundaries and communicate openly with your parents about how their comments affect you. You can let them know that while you value their input, you also need their support and encouragement to pursue your goals wholeheartedly.
As for seeking external support, reaching out to a Family Service Centre could be helpful for you in this situation as they can provide support and guidance in detail, especially when it comes to managing the relationship and communication between you and your parents.
In the meantime, I encourage you to focus on staying grounded and resilient in the face of adversity! Surround yourself with positive influences, whether it’s friends, mentors, or supportive communities, who uplift and encourage you along your journey. I believe you have the strength to overcome this obstacle.
Last but not least, please let us know how you’re coping so far and share with us your journey. We’re here to support you !",,3,,11733,11733.0,11733.0,

To their greatest dismay, after opting to repeat a semester, I ended up repeating a year because at the rate that I was studying I could not meet the criteria to enter Y3.

I got back my results for my final semester, and I have scored B+ for both my intern and FYP. To add on, I was even selected for a FYP student project showcase that was conducted exclusively for students who had projects worthy of being showcased to industry leaders! It provided a rewarding experience as I was able to get feedback from people who would directly benefit from my project. What a good way to end this phase of education!
Disclaimer: This post is gonna be long.
Now, here they go again…
Well, TBH I was optimistic about working in the months before matriculating in Uni, but now I realised that there is a slight problem in executing my plan. It has got to do with my sleep problems as mentioned in my aforementioned post.
I share my room with my grandmother. So whether it is about deciding who gets to use the extension cord in our room to charge our devices or when to turn off the light, I have to take into consideration her view also.
My grandma owns two tech gadgets, an iPhone and an iPad namely. She uses them to watch YouTube videos, listen to music and to talk to my aunt who lives overseas. The problem arises because of the fact that she can’t limit her screen time. Daily, she uses both her devices for a total of 8 hours on an average. (Ps. That’s actually more than how long I used my laptop to study when I was in Y2). The problem arises when she blares her YouTube video even at the middle of the night. She used to use her earpieces in the past, but after my aunt advised against the excessive usage of earpieces, she stopped using them totally. I’m not exaggerating when I say that her devices’ loudness have made my heart pound amidst my slumber, when she plays her videos midnight. Apart from my depression causing sleep problems, I have had sleepless nights because of such external factors. I get really irritated because of this behaviour and made me retaliate by turning on the light to study at my desk at the middle of the night. What’s made me wondering is that she dozes of soon after I turn on the light to study. And there goes my sleep…
My parents and I have told her that this action of hers is affecting each of our daily lives negatively. It causes disturbances to my father who works from home on alternate weeks and has also caused sleep problems in my mother too! Yet, this problem doesn’t seem to get rectified even after 5 years!
With the ever existent sleep problems at hand, I doubt my initial plan of working before entering uni. It is my greater priority to restore my health before getting ready to tackle a heavier academic load. And now this is the biggest elephant in my room.
The thing is that, I am highly anticipating my university offer in the coming weeks. However, the constant pressure from my parents for having a backup plan in the mean time, is literally killing me every day.
Any suggestions to tackle this problem?",,1,,,,,

Actually, my father uses the hall when he works from home. This mainly because the WiFi strength is better in our living room which is crucial for him to work.
It must be noted that our TV is capable of playing YouTube videos. We watch YouTube videos together as a family when we have lunch or dinner together. It’s just that my grandma doesn’t seem to have any other meaningful pastimes beyond watching YouTube videos. She used to read books and go for walks in the past. But now her iPad seems to offer more pleasure than those activities. Guess it’s a case against instant gratification…

Just a little bit of a rant…
After my previous update, my sleep problem got worse up to a point where I had to move over to my parents’ room at night to sleep. This was because despite insisting and asking my grandma to lower the volume of her devices, she did not (and does not) seem to listen to us. My father had to step in and “convince” my grandma that I had to move out to sleep in their room at night. Similarly, I also cannot use my table to study cos of the same issue. To solve this problem, I spend my time studying in the library for 4-5 hours a day. Some way is better than no way, right?
TBH, I’m not too particular about sleeping in my parents’ room or going to the library to study. It’s just that… it hurts to see that my grandma doesn’t even acknowledge that this as an issue. I’m not asking them to acknowledge it, to earn their sympathy but just to gain their understanding when I insist on going to the library every now and then.
Oh well, this is the biggest elephant in the room that I’m dealing with right now. Thanks for reading through. Hope everything will change one day…",,0,,,,,

I didn’t want to make the matter complicated and big but I didn’t want my ex-team leader to bully the next victim. He did it to my previous colleagues who were on my team and it happened to me now.

I’m so sorry to hear you had to deal with bullies at your workplace. It must have been exhausting to be in that toxic environment. Thank you for reaching out to us.
First, let’s take a moment to celebrate you - for having the courage to speak up about the emotional abuse you experienced. It’s not easy to confront such issues, and taking steps to address them is a significant move towards protecting your well-being. It’s completely normal, especially when you’re new to the workforce, to seek guidance and support from management, and not receiving that support can be incredibly disheartening and isolating. Your feelings are entirely valid, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling mentally exhausted and drained. Despite not liking conflict, you managed to raise the issue with HR and your manager, showing remarkable bravery and a strong sense of justice. These are great strengths that will serve you well in your future endeavours.
It’s important to understand that our personality can change and grow. We are not stuck. Your identity as someone who will do your best in everything, but feels not firm and confident and is emotional when things are bad and stressful, doesn’t need to remain the same. I’m glad you are reaching out for support to grow further. Well done!
Being emotional is a healthy part of being human. It shows your body is working very hard to signal to you what is not okay for you, and it’s not something to be ashamed of. When we begin to listen and attune to our body, the strength of our emotions diminishes. However, when we override and ignore them, their strength increases. By acknowledging and understanding your emotions, you can use them as a guide to improve your situation and well-being.
Here are some suggestions and perspectives for your consideration:
2. Build Confidence and Assertiveness:
Self-Awareness: Understand your strengths and areas where you excel. Recognise your achievements and contributions.
Example: Keep a journal of your accomplishments and review it regularly to remind yourself of your successes.
Example: Take personality assessments or strengths-finder tests to gain insights into your unique qualities.
Assertiveness Training: Consider workshops or online courses that focus on communication skills and assertiveness. Learning how to express your thoughts and feelings confidently can help you set boundaries effectively.
Example: Enroll in an assertiveness training course or join a local Toastmasters club to practice public speaking and assertiveness.
Example: Role-play assertive communication scenarios with a trusted friend or mentor to build your confidence.

9. Set Clear Boundaries:
Define Limits: Be clear about what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour towards you. Communicate these boundaries to your colleagues and superiors respectfully but firmly.
Example: Write down specific behaviours that are unacceptable to you and practice how to address them calmly if they occur.
Example: Use “I” statements when communicating your boundaries, such as “I feel uncomfortable when…” to express your feelings without sounding accusatory.
Consistent Enforcement: Consistently enforce your boundaries. If someone crosses them, address it immediately in a calm and professional manner.
Example: If a colleague interrupts you repeatedly, you could say, “I appreciate your input, but I need to finish my point before I lose my train of thought.”
Example: If someone makes an inappropriate comment, address it right away by saying, “That comment makes me uncomfortable. Please refrain from saying things like that.”

It’s normal to feel uncomfortable at the thought of crossing paths with ex-colleagues who were bullies. It’s okay to feel this way. Remember, you don’t need to change your course or compromise your benefits because of a bully. Here are some strategies to navigate these interactions:
2. Stay Professional: Maintain a professional demeanour when you encounter them. Keep interactions brief and focused on work-related matters.
Example: If you run into an ex-colleague in the hallway, greet them politely but keep the conversation short and relevant to work.
Example: In meetings, stick to the agenda and avoid engaging in personal conversations with the ex-colleague.

5. Set Boundaries: Be clear about your boundaries and enforce them consistently.
Example: If an ex-colleague tries to engage you in personal conversation, politely but firmly steer the conversation back to professional topics.
Example: If you feel uncomfortable, excuse yourself from the situation by saying you need to get back to work or attend another meeting.

7. Example: If you feel uncomfortable, excuse yourself from the situation by saying you need to get back to work or attend another meeting.
8. Seek Support: Lean on your support system, whether it’s friends, family, or colleagues, for encouragement and advice.
Example: Talk to a trusted colleague before or after encountering an ex-colleague to debrief and get support.
Example: Schedule regular check-ins with a mentor or therapist to discuss your experiences and get guidance.

Example: Create a vision board with your career goals and look at it whenever you need motivation.
Example: Write down your professional aspirations and keep them in a place where you can easily refer to them.

- Evaluate the Offer: Consider if the temporary position aligns with your career goals and if the work environment will be supportive and healthy for you. Here are some journal prompts to assist you:
2. What aspects of the new position excite me, and how do they align with my career goals?
3. What concerns do I have about working in the new department, and how can I address them?
4. How will accepting this position affect my mental and emotional well-being?
5. What support systems and resources are available to me in this new role?
6. What steps can I take to ensure that I set and maintain healthy boundaries in this new position?
- Self-Care: Prioritise your mental and emotional well-being. If you feel that accepting the new position might place you in another harmful environment, it’s perfectly acceptable to explore other job opportunities. If finances are a concern, you can take up the role temporarily while continuing your job search for a more suitable position.
Standing up for yourself is a continuous process, and seeking help when needed is a sign of strength, not weakness. Take one step at a time, and know that it’s okay to prioritise your well-being above all else.

Thank you for reaching out and asking such an insightful question. It shows a great level of self-awareness and a commitment to personal growth. Dealing with thoughts about mistakes can indeed be challenging, and it seems like you’re already taking a proactive step by seeking advice on how to move forward. Well done!
It’s natural to want to learn from our mistakes to avoid repeating them, and you’re right that reflection is key to this process. However, it’s also important to find a balance so that you don’t dwell on mistakes excessively. Here are some strategies for your consideration:
2. Acknowledge and Accept: Understand that making mistakes is a part of life and an opportunity for learning and improvement. Your willingness to reflect shows your dedication to doing better already!
3. Learn and Reflect: Take time to analyse what went wrong and what you can learn from it. This thoughtful approach allows you to grow without letting self-criticism overwhelm you.
4. Set Realistic Goals: Focus on progress rather than perfection. Setting achievable goals helps alleviate the pressure to avoid mistakes completely, fostering a healthier mindset.
5. Practice Self-Compassion: Treat yourself with kindness when mistakes occur. Remember, everyone makes them. Offering yourself empathy and understanding can help ease the anxiety of making future mistakes.
6. Manage Thoughts: When thoughts about past mistakes arise, gently redirect your focus to the present or future actions. Engaging in activities that bring you joy or fulfillment can also help shift your mindset away from rumination.
Rumination, or repeatedly thinking about past mistakes, can initially serve as a protective mechanism to prevent future errors. However, it often leads to heightened anxiety and self-doubt, which can hinder your growth and resilience. By practicing mindfulness and focusing on constructive actions, you can break free from the cycle of rumination and empower yourself to learn and grow from your experiences.
Embracing a growth mindset, where you see challenges and setbacks as opportunities for learning and development, can lead to greater resilience and success. Unlike a fixed mindset, which views abilities as static and avoids challenges to protect self-esteem, a growth mindset encourages perseverance and a belief in your ability to improve over time.
Most importantly, do make the time to thank yourself for trying your best. It’s normal to give our best shot and sometimes still miss the goal. Giving our best doesn’t mean we always need to get it right. Sometimes in getting things wrong, we may gain greater insights and possibilities then if we had gotten it right. For example, the world benefited from their mistakes:
Post-it Notes: In 1968, Spencer Silver, a scientist at 3M, accidentally developed a low-tack, reusable adhesive that would later become the basis for Post-it Notes. The invention occurred when Silver was attempting to create a strong adhesive but ended up with one that only had a weak grip.
Artificial Sweetener (Saccharin): In 1879, Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist, accidentally discovered saccharin when he forgot to wash his hands before eating dinner. He noticed a sweet taste on his fingers, which led to the discovery of the first artificial sweetener.
Pacemaker: The modern pacemaker, a device that helps regulate heart rhythms, was invented by Wilson Greatbatch in 1956. He accidentally installed the wrong resistor in an oscillator circuit he was building, causing the device to emit electrical pulses similar to those of the heart.
I hope the information above has been helpful in giving yourself permission to be kinder to yourself and allowing more space for your humanity. If there’s anything else you’d like to discuss or if you need additional resources, please feel free to share. We’re here to listen and support you, because you matter!

Thank you for sharing more with me, it was helpful to get a better picture. First there is nothing wrong with you and you’re amazing just the way you are even when you make mistakes.
To understand why this habit is really hard to break, let’s learn a little bit about how our brain works. Our nervous system has two main parts: the thinking brain (the prefrontal cortex) and the feeling brain (the limbic system). When we see a task as hard or challenging—a threat—our body responds to stress. This makes our thinking brain shut down for a while, and our feeling brain takes over. This can cause a fight-or-flight response, making us rush through tasks to finish them quickly.
To handle this, the first step is to give yourself permission to make mistakes. Help your body and brain learn that you are safe. Laugh and smile at your mistakes so they don’t feel like a threat. This can help calm your nervous system.
Next, try to have a growth mindset. A growth mindset means believing that you can improve your abilities and intelligence through effort, learning, and perseverance. Instead of seeing mistakes as failures, view them as chances to learn and grow.
Here are some tips to help with your homework and studying:
2. Prioritise Your Tasks: Break your work into smaller, manageable chunks and prioritise them. This can make the workload feel less overwhelming and help you focus on one task at a time.
3. Set Time Limits: Allocate specific time slots for each task and stick to them. This can help you pace yourself and avoid rushing.
4. Take Breaks: Regular breaks can reduce feelings of overwhelm and help you maintain focus. Even short breaks can make a big difference.
5. Mindfulness: Stay aware of your tendency to rush. Set reminders or use techniques like deep breathing to stay grounded.
6. Review Process: Make it a habit to set aside a few minutes at the end of each task to review your work, no matter how much time you think you have.
7. Practice in a Non-Test Setting: Regularly practise your skills in a non-test setting or use mock tests. This can help you become more comfortable with the material and reduce stress when it comes to the real thing.
Also, think about whether any learning difficulties might be impacting your work. If you think there might be, getting support or an assessment could be helpful.
Remember, creating consistent habits can help you maintain a steady pace and reduce errors over time. Aim to improve just 1% a day and slowly build up.

Last year was A Levels year, and I flunked my exams… While studying, I felt suffocated… like wearing a turtle neck tee that is two sizes too small… I often found myself grabbing the tee shirt collar downwards just trying to study. While I could still breathe normally (ie not hyperventilating), each breath felt difficult.
Eventually, I lost my determination to study. I wasn’t the kind of student to go into an examination unprepared, but that was what I ended up doing for my prelims (and eventually A Levels).
After receiving my horrible prelims grades, I did try to get myself back up to study, but each time I felt suffocated, I took longer and longer to recover. Gradually, I stopped studying because I had lost all motivation/determination, etc. I would spend hours staring at my ceiling, so unmotivated to even get out of bed, much less raise my pen.
I’m not sure if what I described above would count as some form of anxiety, or am I just exaggerating my stress (as my friends and family would tell me)?
Catching up to today, I dont have such suffocating episodes anymore now that I am not studying. I have started working but I spend so much of my time after hours, overthinking my mistakes at work that I find it hard to feel rested. I tend to replay scenes of my mistakes in my head repeatedly, and chiding myself for being embarrassing/stupid. Do tell me if feeling such anxiousness is normal or if I should be seeking professional help? Appreciate everyone who read till the end! Have a great day!",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing so openly about your painful past experiences and describing in detail what you went through. It is clear you have given it a lot of thought and have made some links between the anxiety you feel now and what happened in junior college. It seems, however, that some of your friends and family whom you might have confided in, have largely discounted how you feel and this might have led you to be unsure as to what you may be struggling with.
While stress and anxiety is a part of life, when it reaches a point where it interferes with our daily life and functioning, it might be best to seek professional help just as we would see a doctor if we were feeling physically unwell and unsure what might be the matter. For you, it did get to that point while you were doing your ‘A’ levels and although the anxiety and panic attacks are not as intense now, you have noted the presence of a harsh inner critic, ruminations and overthinking. As such, I don’t see the harm in checking in with a professional for some help and perhaps also to process what happened in your earlier years.
Hope this helps! Please take care and do reach out if you have more questions. You are very brave to be seeking help by the way!",,0,,,,,

Thank you for coming to share your heavy load with us.
I’m truly sorry to hear about what you’re going through and want you to know that you’re not alone.
Losing $10,000 and being in $5,000 debt is a heavy burden to carry. It’s understandable to grieve the decisions you’ve made and feel regret over your financial situation. On top of that, dealing with the pain of neglecting yourself in a toxic relationship can be incredibly challenging. These experiences can make you feel overwhelmed and hopeless, but there are ways to navigate through this.
First, let’s normalise mistakes and recognise that you did the best you could with the resources and information you had at the time. It’s okay to make mistakes. You’re not alone in making poor financial decisions. Many people have lost money in investments, and this has been a common occurrence since the early days of financial markets, dating back to the 17th century and beyond. Adopting a growth mindset can help you learn from these mistakes and improve. Here are a few journal prompts to help you reflect on what you could have done better now, looking back with hindsight:
- What information or resources could have helped me make better investment decisions?
- How could I have better assessed the risks involved in my investments?
- What financial habits or practices can I change to avoid similar mistakes in the future?
- What steps can I take to make better investment decisions in the future?
- How can I ensure that I only use spare money for investments?
Remember, money can be earned back. It may take a little longer, but it’s possible to not only recover but also grow even stronger. For instance, successful individuals like Warren Buffett and Elon Musk have faced setbacks in their careers but bounced back stronger than before. They demonstrate the resilience needed to overcome financial challenges and achieve success. It’s essential to be resilient, learn from your experiences, and continually strive to improve.
Consider speaking to a financial advisor or counsellor who can help you create a plan to manage your debt and finances. Start by making a detailed budget to track your expenses and find areas where you can cut back. Additionally, look for ways to increase your income, such as part-time jobs or freelance work.
When facing feelings of worthlessness and shame, it’s helpful to consult a mental health professional who can offer strategies to manage these emotions and boost your self-esteem. Engaging in activities that bring you joy, such as hobbies, exercise, or spending time with loved ones, can also help uplift your spirits. If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, please reach out immediately to a crisis helpline like SOS - 1767 or a trusted person for support.
Remember, our inner voice plays a crucial role in how we perceive ourselves. Being self-critical can hinder our ability to find solutions and improve, similar to having a critical boss rather than a supportive one. Consider yourself the leader of the millions of cells in your body. Treat yourself with kindness and compassion, just as you would guide and nurture a dedicated team. I hope you will choose to be a good boss, because all the cells in your body are working very hard to help you survive and thrive. Help them by practising kindness and love. Practise positive self-affirmations such as:
- “I am capable of overcoming challenges.”
- “I deserve love and respect.”
- “I learn from my mistakes and grow stronger every day.”
Coping with past relationship trauma is challenging and therapy can help you process your feelings about your past relationship and the betrayal you experienced. Journalling about your experiences and emotions can be a therapeutic way to understand and deal with your feelings. Here are a few more journal prompts that might help you reflect on the learning points from these experiences:
- What have I learned about myself through my financial struggles and past relationship?
- How can I use these experiences to make better decisions in the future?
- What are some positive qualities or strengths that I have discovered about myself during these difficult times?
- How can I practice self-compassion and forgiveness towards myself?
For your current relationship, lying can feel like an easier route as a way of protecting yourself. It helps to avoid uncomfortable discussions. However, it’s important to consider the lasting impact on the relationship. If you’re willing, make time to reflect on your ideal relationship and the values you want to be known for. Honesty and trust are foundational to healthy relationships. Here are a few journal prompts to help you explore this further:
- How does honesty contribute to building trust in my relationships?
- What are my values around honesty and integrity in relationships?
- How can I communicate openly and honestly with my partner about my financial situation and emotional struggles?
Feeling disgusted and shameful is tough, but practising self-compassion by being kind to yourself and recognising that everyone makes mistakes and has regrets can help. If you feel comfortable, seek guidance from a religious leader or community who can offer you spiritual support and reassurance. Many religious teachings emphasise the importance of forgiveness and the possibility of redemption, so speak to a spiritual advisor to explore these teachings and find comfort.
Moving forward, set small, achievable goals for yourself to work towards a more positive future. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can offer encouragement and help you stay motivated. Remember, you are not alone, and there are many resources and people who can support you through this difficult time.
Hoping for peace is a beautiful desire, but desire alone isn’t enough. Being true to yourself and truly accepting yourself for all your strengths and weaknesses is what will help you gain lasting peace. Loving yourself first and being kind to yourself is the first step. As the saying goes, “Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.” Taking the first step to seek help is already a significant move towards recovery and a better future - Well done!
From all your sharing in your 3 post, it’s evident that you’ve shown resilience by seeking guidance and reflecting on your experiences. Your willingness to learn and improve demonstrates courage and determination. I trust in your ability to overcome obstacles and create a brighter future for yourself.
Please take care and reach out if you need further assistance.

While kids are important, it’s crucial to prioritise what truly matters to you. Kids are not emotionally numb and can often sense tension at home. I’ve had friends whose parents stayed together just for the kids, and they often felt the unhappiness in the household. The age of the children also plays a significant role. If I were younger, I might not fully understand the situation. As a teenager, I would appreciate my parents explaining the situation to me and treating me like a valued individual. Now, as a uni student, I understand that I’m my own person and will respect whatever decision my parents make.
If staying together with your partner feels like the right decision, that’s completely valid. But often, it’s easy to unintentionally shift the blame onto the kids for staying together, which could lead to resentment.

Thank you for sharing your feelings and concerns with us. I can only imagine how tough it must be for you to deal with all these strong and conflicting emotions. I’m really glad that you chose to be brave and reach out for support. Having the ability and willingness to express yourself and understand what you’re going through is a good first step.
Question 1: Is this depression?
The symptoms you’re describing could indeed be signs of depression, especially given the context of a significant betrayal. Constantly thinking a lot, feeling tired/restless, being overly emotional, feeling stressed, and doubting your partner are all common symptoms of depression and anxiety. The inability to destress due to surgery also adds to your emotional burden.
It’s important to note that depression can have various factors and is often confused with general feelings of low mood. The difference lies in how long and how severe the symptoms are. A mental health professional can offer a proper diagnosis, guidance, support, and treatment options to help you manage these feelings.
*Question 2: If it’s you, what would you do? Divorce or try to work things out? Or?
This situation is incredibly challenging, and it’s understandable to feel torn. Every relationship is unique, and there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Here are a few considerations:
- Therapy: Consider couples therapy and individual therapy to understand your feelings and the dynamics of your relationship.
- Time: Give yourself time to heal and think about what you truly want.
- Trust: Assess whether you believe you can rebuild trust with your partner.
- Support System: Lean on your support system—friends, family, and professionals.
Ultimately, the decision should be based on what’s best for your mental health and well-being.
Question 3: If there’s no kid involved in this marriage, would your answer be different?
The presence of children can complicate the decision, as their well-being is a significant factor. Without kids, the focus would be solely on your needs and the relationship dynamics. However, the fundamental questions of trust, love, and willingness to work through the issues would remain the same.
Question 1: Are you only sorry because you got caught?
Thank you for your honesty. It must be difficult to confront these questions. Thank you for your bravery too. I suppose reflecting deeply on your motivations, can be helpful. Genuine remorse involves understanding the pain you’ve caused and a sincere desire to make amends, beyond just the fear of consequences. Here are some journal prompts for your consideration:
2. Reflecting on Remorse:
How do you define genuine remorse? What does it mean to you personally?
Have there been times in your life when you’ve felt remorseful? How did you handle those situations?
What emotions arise when you think about the pain you may have caused others?
3. How do you define genuine remorse? What does it mean to you personally?
4. Have there been times in your life when you’ve felt remorseful? How did you handle those situations?
5. What emotions arise when you think about the pain you may have caused others?
6. Motivations and Actions:
What motivations or emotions typically drive your actions in difficult situations?
How do you think fear of consequences influences decision-making?
Reflect on a time when you faced a moral dilemma. How did you navigate it, and what did you learn from the experience?
7. What motivations or emotions typically drive your actions in difficult situations?
8. How do you think fear of consequences influences decision-making?
9. Reflect on a time when you faced a moral dilemma. How did you navigate it, and what did you learn from the experience?
10. Understanding Personal Growth:
How do you envision making amends in a situation where trust has been broken?

How can you cultivate empathy and understanding towards those you’ve hurt?

- How can you practice forgiveness and self-compassion throughout this process?
Question 2: Do you really love your partner? If yes, why cheat? If not, why keep telling your partner you love him/her?
As powerful as love is, sometimes that alone isn’t sufficient. Love is the overarching umbrella, but beneath it are many other elements crucial for a thriving relationship. Cheating can stem from various issues such as unmet needs, personal insecurities, or momentary lapses in judgment. It’s crucial to identify the root causes. Communication, trust, respect, and empathy are all vital components that support a healthy relationship. Self-love is just as important. These elements help navigate challenges and foster a deeper connection between partners.
Consider how each of these elements plays a role in your relationship. How do you currently nurture these aspects, and where could there be room for improvement? Journaling about these questions can provide insights into your values, behaviors, and aspirations for your relationship.
Question 3: Your partner constantly doubting you, or gets angry/sad for little things that you do. Would you rather divorce and be in the new relationship?
This must be an incredibly challenging situation for you both. It’s crucial to consider the long-term impact of your actions. Rebuilding trust takes time and effort, and it’s natural for your partner to experience doubt and emotional turmoil. Especially if there are children involved, you’ll still be parents together and will need to collaborate in raising them. Deciding whether to stay and work through these challenges or to consider other options should be based on a sincere assessment of your commitment and the willingness of both parties to change and grow.
Question 1: If you’re the kid, would you be okay that your parents have to divorce?
Thank you for considering the impact on your children. This must be incredibly tough on them as well. Children typically want their parents to be happy, whether together or apart. Honest communication, reassurance, and ensuring their emotional needs are met are crucial. While divorce can be difficult, a household with unresolved conflict can be more damaging in the long run. The focus should be on creating a stable, loving environment for the children, regardless of marital status.
Navigating the aftermath of infidelity is challenging and complex. Professional guidance, open communication, and a focus on emotional well-being are vital for everyone involved. It’s important to recognise that while infidelity is incredibly painful, it often signals underlying challenges in the marriage that existed before the betrayal. Both partners can benefit from reviewing what other factors were not okay in the marriage. By addressing these underlying issues, couples can gain a better understanding of their relationship and make informed decisions about their future. Remember, the goal is to find a path that leads to healing and a healthy future, whether that means staying together or parting ways.

I’m sorry to hear that you are experiencing discomfort in your relationship. Navigating trust and vulnerability in a relationship can be challenging. It’s normal to feel hesitant or anxious about trust, especially when being vulnerable.
Thank you for coming here to share with us your struggles. Acknowledging your uncomfortable feelings and reaching out for support is a step in the right direction. Well done!
Here are some perspectives for your consideration:
2. Acknowledge and Accept Your Feelings: Recognise that feeling hesitant or anxious about trust is a natural response to wanting to protect yourself emotionally. For example, you might say to yourself, “It’s okay to feel unsure right now. I’m learning to trust at my own pace.”
3. Open Communication: Have an open conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings. Share your concerns and fears calmly and constructively. It can be helpful to communicate what steps you need to feel safe or what words you need to hear. For instance, you could say, “I’ve been feeling anxious about trusting fully, and I’d like to talk about it with you. Can we set aside some time to discuss this? I would appreciate it if you could reassure me about your feelings towards me.”
4. Focus on the Present and Practice Self-Regulation Skills: Remind yourself that your boyfriend’s past experiences have shaped who he is today, but they don’t define your current relationship. Practice self-regulation skills, such as mindfulness or deep breathing, to stay grounded in the present moment and manage any overwhelming emotions that arise. For example, when unhelpful thoughts about his past arise, you could practice a mindfulness exercise to help redirect your focus to the present.
5. Challenge Negative Thoughts with Facts and Evidence: Negative thoughts often serve as a protective mechanism, alerting us to potential risks. When these thoughts arise, challenge them by looking for evidence and facts that support or contradict them. For example, if you find yourself worrying about his past relationships, compare how he handled things then with how he behaves now. Notice any positive changes or growth that indicate he is committed to your relationship. This can help reassure your mind that things are indeed different. At the same time, trust yourself to discern any red flags or concerns that may arise. Your instincts are valuable in guiding what is best for you and your wellbeing.
6. Self-Reflection: Take time to reflect on any personal insecurities or past experiences that may be influencing your trust issues. Understanding these factors can help you address them effectively. For example, journal about times when trust has been difficult for you in the past and explore how those experiences shape your current feelings. Reflect on a time when you trusted someone deeply. What factors contributed to that trust? How can you apply those lessons to your current relationship? Consider how cultural or familial backgrounds influence your perceptions and expectations of trust. Are there beliefs or values that impact how you approach trust in relationships?
Journal about your fears or anxieties related to trust. Are there specific triggers or patterns you notice? How can you address these feelings?
7. Set Small Goals: Break down the process of building trust into smaller, achievable goals. For instance, commit to sharing one personal experience or feeling with your boyfriend each week to gradually increase your comfort with vulnerability. This could be as simple as sharing a childhood memory or discussing a personal goal.
8. Practice Patience and Self-Compassion: Trust takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and with the process. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding as you navigate your feelings and relationship dynamics. For example, if you feel overwhelmed by negative thoughts, take a moment to practice deep breathing or mindfulness to calm your mind.
9. Seek Support if Needed: Consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist who can provide support and perspective. Sometimes discussing your feelings with a neutral party can offer clarity and guidance. Reach out for support when you feel stuck or unsure how to move forward.
I hope you will view these challenges as an opportunity to work towards building stronger trust and a deeper connection in your relationships. As they say relationships are journeys of growth, and it’s okay to take the time you need to feel secure and comfortable.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Would also like to bring up something recent I have noticed. There was a recent issue that caused my boyfriend to feel unhappy. We have communicated why he felt that way and he said he just needs to take some time to understand and process it and that he may appear a bit distant during this process. Indeed he feels more distant after this. I’m confused as to how to respond to this though . Because part of me wants to also pull back since he’s also pulling back. Yet part of me also wants to kind of go towards him because im afraid his retreat means that he might be going towards leaving. By default (from what I usually do), i would tend to pull back when people pull back because i just feel that if they’re being distant this means theyre leaving and i cant do anything about it, hence I shall not becuase anything I do wouldnt matter to change their mind any way.

Navigating situations like this can feel really tough. It sounds like your boyfriend is taking some time to process his feelings, which is important for him to do. Here are a few things you might want to consider:
2. Give Him Space with Support: For example, let him know you’re there for him if he wants to talk or needs support, but also respect his need for some distance right now. Maybe send him a supportive message saying, “I understand you need some time to process things. I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk.”
3. Stay Connected: While he’s processing, check in occasionally to see how he’s doing. You could send a message like, “Just wanted to see how you’re feeling today. No pressure to talk if you’re not ready, but I’m thinking of you.”
4. Communicate Your Feelings: It’s important to express your own feelings too. For instance, let him know if you’re feeling uncertain or worried about his distance. You could say, “I understand you need space, but I also feel a bit unsure when you’re distant. Can we talk about how we’re both feeling when you’re ready?”
5. Focus on Yourself: Use this time to focus on your own well-being and interests. Maybe you could spend more time doing activities you enjoy or catching up with friends who support you emotionally.
6. Seek Support: If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or unsure, talking to a trusted friend or counsellor can provide clarity and support.
Additionally, I’d also like to encourage you to reflect on the following:
2. Reflect on your current self-care routines. What are some activities or practices that help you feel calm and grounded? Describe how these rituals contribute to your overall well-being.
3. Take a moment to identify your emotional, physical, and mental needs. How well are you meeting these needs in your daily life? Are there areas where you could improve or add more support for yourself?
4. Explore your boundaries in relationships, including with your boyfriend. What are your limits when it comes to giving space or seeking closeness? Reflect on how clear boundaries can support both your own well-being and the health of your relationships.
It’s normal for relationships to have their challenges, and it’s okay to feel uncertain sometimes. Trusting each other and keeping the lines of communication open can help navigate these moments together.

I have felt like this for a while, and I have been trying to push it away by distracting myself with games, movies, sleeping, or talking about anything except what bothers me.

Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you’re going through. I’m really sorry to hear that things have been tough for you lately. It’s okay to feel upset or hurt inside, even when everything seems okay on the outside.
It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot on your shoulders for a long time. It’s normal to feel frustrated when you’re not taken seriously or when your feelings aren’t understood. Your experiences growing up, where you were praised one moment and criticised the next, can really affect how you see yourself and how you react to things now.
It’s important to know that your feelings are important and valid. It’s not easy to handle these emotions, especially when they’ve been building up over time. It takes courage to recognise how past experiences shape our current feelings.
Crying is something natural and healthy that happens when we’re feeling overwhelmed or need support. Here’s why it can be helpful:
- Emotional Release: Crying lets out emotions we’ve been holding in. When we cry, our bodies release stress hormones, which can make us feel calmer and more relaxed afterwards. It’s a way for our bodies to take care of us.
- Communication: Crying is a way to show that we need help or comfort, even without words. It tells others that we’re going through something tough and could use some support.
- Self-Soothing: Crying can trigger our parasympathetic nervous system, which helps our bodies calm down and rest. This can bring a sense of relief and peace after we’ve had a good cry.
It’s okay to try to push away our emotions to feel better for a while, but in the long run, those feelings can get stronger. Emotions are like signals from our body telling us that something needs attention or change. Ignoring them might cause physical pain or illnesses as our body tries to get us to listen. I’m glad you’re noticing that something isn’t quite right and asking for help. Well done!
Anger is a natural feeling that tells us when something isn’t fair or right. It’s like an alarm system for our emotions. Feeling angry can give us the push we need to make positive changes or stand up for ourselves when it’s necessary. It’s important to deal with anger in a good way, like talking about how you feel without hurting others. Doing deep breathing, exercise, or calming activities can also help when you’re feeling really mad. Understanding why you’re angry can help you handle those feelings better.
If you’re okay with it, can you share with us more about what makes you think you might be autistic? Knowing more about your experiences can help us support you better.
I can only imagine how confusing and tough it must be for you when you feel like your birth identity doesn’t match who you are inside. It’s a personal journey that can leave you feeling unsure and conflicted. Not being able to talk about this with your loved ones can make you feel lonely, like you’re hiding a big part of yourself. It’s okay to feel this way and to want understanding from those who are close to you too.
Dealing with these feelings can be tough, and it’s okay to take your time to figure out who you are. You deserve support and kindness as you learn more about yourself. It’s okay to explore your identity and discover what feels right for you, including your pronouns.
At age 13, puberty could be starting, which can make emotions feel stronger. Your brain is still developing during this time, which can affect how you think and feel about yourself and the world around you. Remember, your brain won’t fully develop until around age 25, so be patient with yourself as you grow and change. You don’t have to have everything figured out right now. Allow yourself to learn and grow at your own pace.
It’s really brave of you to realise that you might need some extra support. It’s important to find someone you trust to talk to about these feelings. If your parents are unsure or hesitant, maybe there’s a teacher, school counselor, or another adult you trust who can help you talk to them in a supportive way.
If it’s okay with you, I’d like to offer another way of looking at things. Whether someone identifies as male or female is just one part of who they are. Your character, values, strengths, and how you approach growth are much bigger aspects of who you are, and they’re all about who you are as a person, not about gender. While you’re figuring out your gender identity, it’s also important to let yourself grow and develop these other parts of who you are too.
Here are some journal prompts to help you think about these other parts of yourself:
2. Reflect on Your Values: What values mean the most to you? How do they influence the choices you make and the way you act?
3. Strengths and Challenges: What are your strengths? How have these strengths helped you overcome difficult situations in your life?
4. Goals and Ambitions: What are your goals for the near future and for the long term? How do you plan to achieve them step by step?
5. Self-Discovery: What hobbies or activities make you feel most like yourself? How do these activities shape your sense of who you are?
6. Gratitude Journaling: List three things you’re grateful for today. How do these things make your life better or brighter?
7. Mindfulness and Reflection: Recall a recent accomplishment or moment of pride. What did this experience teach you about yourself?
8. Personal Growth: How have you grown emotionally, mentally, or physically over the past year? What lessons have you learned about yourself through these experiences?
9. Coping Strategies: When you’re feeling overwhelmed or upset, what techniques do you use to calm down and feel better?
10. Self-Care Rituals: How do you take care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally? What activities or routines help you feel good and balanced?
11. Role Models: Who do you look up to and why? What qualities do they possess that you admire and want to develop in yourself?
Discovering who you are is a journey that needs patience and kindness towards yourself. Embrace all aspects of yourself and allow yourself to grow at your own speed. Your feelings are important, and asking for help doesn’t mean you’re weak. It takes bravery to want to feel happier and understand things better. Take small steps to learn more about yourself; there’s plenty of time to explore and find out who you truly are.
I hope the information above has been helpful. If you need more resources or if there’s anything else you want to talk about, please feel free to share with us. We’re here to listen to you because your feelings are important and you matter!

13119,Devil vs Angel,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/devil-vs-angel/13119,Coping,emotions,7296,CoolBreeze,Professional,Professional,20134,2,"Dear @negtots ,
Thank you for coming here to share your struggles with us. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of strong emotions and inner conflict, which can be really challenging. It’s great that you’re reaching out for support. Well done!
If you feel comfortable, could you please share a bit more about what you mean by the devil and angel fighting in your mind? It’s common to experience conflicting thoughts between our moral values and our desire to connect with others. If you truly feel that something is wrong, it’s normal to feel anger and frustration when someone you care about doesn’t share the same values.
We can rationalise a situation, but if it doesn’t feel right in our body, our emotions will signal that something isn’t okay. May I invite you to reflect further on what specifically about the situation didn’t feel right for you? Have you had similar experiences in the past? Is there a pattern you’ve noticed?
Here are some journal prompts that might help you explore these feelings:
2. Describe a recent situation where you felt the “devil and angel” conflict in your mind. What were the thoughts and emotions you experienced?
3. Reflect on a time when you felt frustrated or angry with your girlfriend. What values or expectations were involved?
4. Write about a moment when you successfully managed your emotions in a difficult situation. What strategies did you use, and how did it feel?
5. Think about past experiences where you’ve had similar emotional outbursts. What common triggers or patterns do you notice?
6. Explore what “feeling right in your body” means to you. How do your emotions and physical sensations interact in moments of conflict?
Our emotions are not meant to be controlled; they are meant to serve as warning signals, letting us know when something feels good or bad. Instead of trying to control your emotions, it may be more helpful to learn to feel them and ride the emotional wave. Developing Emotional Regulation Skills can assist with this. For example:
- Breathing Exercises: When you feel an emotional outburst coming on, try taking deep, slow breaths. This can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to think before reacting.
- Mindfulness and Meditation: Practising mindfulness and meditation can help you stay grounded and more aware of your emotions as they arise, allowing you to respond to them with greater ease.
Anger isn’t a bad emotion; it serves as a useful signal from our body that a boundary has been crossed. It’s our response to anger that we can improve upon. Learning to pause and respond only when we are calm can significantly strengthen our relationships and friendships. If you feel an outburst coming on, it’s perfectly okay to take a step back and pause the conversation. Communicate to your girlfriend that you need a moment to calm down and gather your thoughts.
You may also want to consider talking to a counsellor or therapist who can provide you with strategies to manage your emotions and understand the root causes of your inner conflict. They can also offer support and guidance tailored to your specific situation.
Managing emotions can feel difficult and it’s okay to struggle sometimes. Be patient and kind with yourself as you improve your self-regulation skills. It is an important life skill that takes time and practice to develop.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Maybe its because the only time they talk to me is when their other friends stop talking to them. Could someone tell me how to make friends? It used to be so simple with a “Hello, lets be friends!”, now its just awkward. What are friends? I’m not sure, but to me friends are just people who give you company. We talk about random funny stuff, we don’t talk about ourselves or I don’t or maybe I do but i lie. Honestly I don’t know much about myself. Maybe the reason I have no friends is because I am not treating them right. But i dont get it, i love and care for my friends. I try to talk to them, be there when they are sad even if I dont know how to comfort them, i give them gifts on their birthdays but i don’t remember them, we have our laughs together but it lasts for a few seconds. Or is it because I’m not genuine? When I do things, i do things because I have too and i would prefer if i didnt need to but no choice. When a friend is sad, IAM suppose to understand them, feel them, feel sad together and comfort them right? Then why is it that i do not really care if they feel sad? I just comfort them to male them stop crying and feel better, but if they weren’t my friend i would just leave them be?

Thank you for sharing with us how you truly feel on this platform, it takes a lot of courage to be authentic and vulnerable and I commend you for that. I’m really grateful that you’ve opened up about your feelings and thoughts, and yes loneliness can be a difficult emotion to grapple with, and it’s natural to have these kinds of questions and doubts about friendships.
I can tell that you do care for your friends, but it seems like there might be some confusion or inner conflict. Could you tell me more about your past experiences or any specific incidents that may have led to these feelings and behaviors in your friendships?
You mentioned wanting to make friends, but also feeling a sense of selfishness and not always genuinely caring about your friends’ emotions. What do you think might be causing this internal conflict, and how do you envision your ideal friendships?
For the time being, I would like to suggest 2 things:
2. Try self-reflection Self-reflection can be a powerful tool. You can take some time to explore your own feelings and motivations, and one of the powerful ways of reflecting is through journaling! Journaling can help you better understand your desires and expectations from friendships.
3. Building meaningful friendships often begins with being authentic and showing vulnerability. Would you like to try to open up to your friends about your thoughts and feelings, and ask them about their experiences and emotions as well? You could start simply by talking about something that’s in the news, or something that’s happening on a daily basis or something that you recently experienced, etc… Genuine connections often grow from shared experiences and mutual understanding
I would also like to share that you can speak to a mental health professional if you’re still confused about how you feel, as these professionals will be able to help you assess and discern if you may need more guidance. They’re also able to help process with you what might be keeping you stuck. In Singapore, we do have many options for therapists (onsite and online) - such as:
- Family service centres
- School counsellors

I just scrolled and just read your post.
You and me have something in common called self doubt and internal conflict.
I have managed to somewhat overcome it a little by occupying my time doing stuff like watching movies or series, or if im at home i either play the guitar or like right now type and write.
I see that a professional has typed and i think it would be useful to listen to the advice and seek help too.
Just to share with you, what i learned is that people have their own lives and pursuits and what is important to them. I get it, I too have friends that only look for me when they want something and makes me feel like i’m just like a transaction. However, There will be times when we get to catch up for brief moments.
There is a quote i hear somewhere that says,
"" When you love a flower, you don’t cut it and bring it with you - that possession, Love is letting the flower grow in the garden and visiting it, watering it and appreciating it in its nature ""
Anyways, If you happen to watch any movies or series and want to share about what you take from it, you’re invited to write in the threat here called "" Movies or Series Reflection "".

In fact you are the best friend anyone could ask for.
YOU SACRIFICE YOUR HAPPINESS JUST FOR A FRIEND!!! THAT’S NOT SELFISH THAT’S LOVE
You are loving people left and right, but you feel empty because your actions aren’t being reciprocated. I think you overthink beyond reality. You are already a good, good friend for being extra like giving gifts and providing emotional support. No one does that. I tell you they only do that for best friends. But you are a gem. I get that you dont want to look lonely. I agree. Who wants to be seen as weird at school? But your friends dont necessarily think of you that way. The fact they still talk to you and communicate show that they’re fine with you! Unless they blatantly ignore you then that’s sus. But you’re still approachable! So dont think of yourself like that
And I LOVE the part where you talk about making friends with non living things. That’s because they dont show emotions, like what you said. You dont have to worry about their reactions, opinions, actions. You are free to express your own. I suggest you keep the healthy bond that way. You do deserve friends, tons of them even. But i think you’re putting in too much effort. Just being by their side is enough. Anyways, about not feeling anything when they’re sad, you’re not being insensitive. Take this: when acting you have to force yourself to cry but it doesn’t mean you feel sad right? This means that even if you dont cry, you still FEEL bad for the person.

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your feelings. It takes a lot of strength and self-awareness to express what you’re going through, and that shows how much you care about your friendships. Sounds like you’re a thoughtful and caring friend, and it’s great that you value your friendships so much. These feelings you’re having are normal and can be a bit tricky to understand.
It’s completely normal to want close, supportive friends. Everyone wants to feel connected and have someone they can rely on. From your sharing it sounds like a part of you understands that your friends might be busy with different things, like school or other friends and they might just have a lot going on. This doesn’t mean they don’t care about you. However, it’s also understandable if another part of you longs for the way things used to be. Experiencing feelings of grief and loss during times of change is normal. The transition period before settling into a new normal can indeed feel uncomfortable. Especially if you’re transitioning to a new school, these feelings are completely normal. Adjusting to new environments and making new friends can take time.
It can be frustrating if you feel like you’re always the one starting conversations. Sometimes, friends don’t realise they’re not reaching out as much as they should. It may be a good idea to talk to your friends about how you’re feeling. Let them know you’d like them to reach out more. This can help them understand your feelings better.
Here are a few things, I’d like to invite you to consider:
2. Think About Your Needs: Pause for a moment to consider what you’re seeking from your friends, and then explore different avenues for fulfilling these needs. Here are some common needs that often arise in friendships:
- Support: You may need emotional support during challenging times, such as dealing with stress, schoolwork, or personal issues.
- Attention: You might crave more attention and acknowledgment from your friends, wanting them to actively listen to you and engage in meaningful conversations.
- Connection: You may desire deeper connections with your friends, wanting to feel understood, valued, and appreciated for who you are.
- Companionship: You might seek companionship and camaraderie, wanting to spend more quality time with your friends and create memorable experiences together.
- Validation: You may need validation and reassurance from your friends, wanting them to affirm your feelings, opinions, and experiences.
3. Make More Friends: Try to meet new people and make more friends. This way, you won’t feel like you’re relying too much on any one person. Joining clubs or activities can be a great way to meet new people. Remember, sharing your thoughts and feelings with new people doesn’t mean you’re burdening them. Many people are happy to listen and connect with others.
4. Meeting Your Own Needs: It’s also important to meet most of your own needs too. It’s up to us to make ourselves feel good. Friends can lend a hand, but it’s important to prioritise our own well-being too. Here are some steps you can take:
Find Hobbies: Engage in activities you enjoy, like drawing, playing a sport, or reading. This can give you a sense of achievement and happiness.
Journaling: Write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal. This can help you understand your emotions better and find ways to address them.
Mindfulness and Relaxation: Practice mindfulness or relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help reduce stress and improve your mood.
Physical Activity: Regular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. Even a short walk or a fun dance session can make a difference.
Self-Care: Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and doing things that make you feel good, like taking a bath or listening to your favourite music.
Set Goals: Set small, achievable goals for yourself in different areas of your life, and work towards them. This can give you a sense of purpose and satisfaction. Here are some suggestions:

Desiring connection with close friends isn’t clingy at all; it’s perfectly normal. Having honest conversations with your current friends and making new ones can help you feel more supported. Making new friends is a valuable life skill to keep working on, and don’t forget to spend time being your own best friend. Treating yourself with kindness will naturally attract others to you.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

It is clingy behaviour
But to me it’s normal cuz i’m clingy oof
You seem to be someone who appreciates your friends. And they prolly make you happy alot that’s why you wanna constantly be around them.
Being close to them might be your coping mechanism even. I think you deserve to be given attention especially from your buddies cuz birds of a feather flock together am i ritee
You aren’t much of a yandere, more of like an innocent lonely bird. It’s so cute and I think the problem is you dont tell them. You have to tell them you feel lonely without them. They’d either make fun of you or understand you. 2 different types of friends. But when you are being heard you’d feel happy and valued. So you should speak your heart out.
I for one wouldnt know if someone feels this way unless they…tell me. You have to say it, (based on personal experience) else you’re just gonna keep worrying for no reason!!

I am very attached to them, to the point that if we hang out for a whole day. I feel sad that i have to go. When they hang out with other friends i used to get jealous but not say anything, because i was scared that they’d leave me. I think I feel jealous because I’m afraid they’re going to replace me with someone that’s better and someone that can treat them well. They’d also always go MIA because they are dealing with their own ■■■■, but i get so stressed out and frustrated and sad when they dont talk to me. I keep wondering if i did something wrong or how i always screw it up that’s why they arent talking to me. Usually I’m used to them going MIA, but recently they’ve been more active and I’ve fallen victim to getting to comfortable. so when they went mia for 3weeks i was reallt frustrated. It frustrated me more when they told me they wouldnt be able to handle meeting people but they met their other friend ? Idk, i know im being childish and stupid but sometimes i cant help but feel that way. Obviously i didnt tell them about my frustrations but idk. Sometimes it feels like if they’d ever leave me i would just die. It’s not like i dont have other friends, i have plenty of loving and amazing friends. But it feels like i could never truly open up to them like how i talked to that friend. I don’t know man.",,2,,,,,

Thanks for finding the courage to share about what you’re currently going through with your closest friendships. I wanna let you know that how you feel is valid given how you’re struggling with your experience and beliefs about what a friendship means to you. Certain friendships are very important to you and it sounds like you’re also able to have a considerable circle of friends. Humans are social creatures that want connection so it makes sense for friendship to be one of our main ways to make connections. I can see that you value connection a lot - you treasure the company, support and joy of being a friend to others and having friends. But on the flipside, you wonder if your desire for connection might also drive them away - and that feels very real and sensible to you!
I wonder when this started for you to feel this way? I wonder if you’re able to check on your values and to kinda figure out the important things that you look for in a friend. What do you think are your values ? Perhaps you can note the important values down and give them some thought. This helps us to make choices that are in line with our values that gives us a sense of content and well-being. I find that values can serve as a guide to help us live a life that is true to who we ARE and want to BE.
Additionally, we hold on to things thinking that it’s important but perhaps we might need to let go of some parts of it. Maybe it’s the perception or concept of what a friend should be or what friendships should look like? The concept called locus of control helps us understand how much of control (on a continuum) we have over what happens. At the same time, having an internal locus of control (believe you have control) does not always equal good and external locus of control (believe that you have no control and external things impact it) does not always equal bad. This lets me know that I can control what I can and that I can cope with what I can’t control.
Of course, this will be rather difficult and I hope you can consider speaking to someone about this. You can also consider this list should you feel like speaking to a professional in a setting that is safe and without judgment:

Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to struggle with the fear of being replaced or left behind. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your friends about your emotions, as communication is key in maintaining healthy relationships. It’s understandable that their absence causes stress, but expressing your concerns could bring clarity.

I think you’re a clingy person and you just want to feel affection and attention. I like that you value your friends this much but do remember not everyone is as loving as you. These “friends” might be thinking of you as just a friend, but not a best friend. Get what i mean? Even best friends leave each other for some days. You seem to really love your friends. That’s great! Maybe you should expand your social circle. The fact you have friends is already a good sign you know how to make connections. So get more friends so you wont feel lonely a lot! Oh and if you do start, try asking them if they’re like you, bubbly and clingy. Who knows you might find your twin flame? Andd uh if you want your friends to always be with you you gotta tell em. Communication is key in any type of relationship. If you dont tell em, they dont know. It may be embarrassing, yes, but they also care about how you feel. Who knows they might set aside some time just to spend more with you? We never know who’d be willing to actually spend their day with you.

I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. It’s tough when you feel like there’s no one around to connect with. Thank you for coming here to share your feelings with us. Being open to new ideas and reaching out for support is a step in the right direction. Well done!
If you feel comfortable, could you share a bit more about what you mean when you say all your friends have left you? Did they move away, switch schools, or simply stop talking to you?
Wanting to have face-to-face friendships is wonderful. Bonding with people in real time, rather than through a device, does wonders for our well-being. Here are some suggestions for your consideration:
2. Explore New Interests: Joining clubs or groups that focus on things you’re interested in, like a sports team, a book club, or a hobby group, can help you meet people who share your passions.
3. Volunteering: Helping out in your community can be a great way to meet new people and also make a positive impact. It might also help you feel more connected. You may want to check out Brahm Centre’s Youth Care, Youth Corps Singapore.
4. School Activities: Participating in school events, whether it’s sports, arts, or any other extracurricular activities, can also help you meet new friends.
Here are some tips on how to make new friends:
- Be Approachable: Smile and make eye contact. This can make you seem more friendly and open to conversation.
- Start Small: Begin with small talk about common interests or experiences, like school, hobbies, or favourite TV shows. It’s okay if some people don’t share your interests. You can still become friends by learning about what each other likes.
- Show Interest: Ask questions and show genuine interest in what others are saying. This can help build a connection.
- Body Language: Pay attention to body language, such as posture and gestures. For example, if someone is facing you and making eye contact, they are likely interested in the conversation.
- Facial Expressions: Notice facial expressions to understand how someone is feeling. A smile usually means they’re happy or friendly.
- Tone of Voice: Listen to the tone of voice to gauge emotions. A cheerful tone often indicates friendliness, while a flat tone might mean disinterest.
If you’re feeling really down, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted adult, like a teacher, school counsellor, or family member. They can offer support and might have ideas on how to meet new people.
Sometimes it takes time to build new friendships. Being open to new experiences and people can help create those connections. It’s okay to feel lonely sometimes, and reaching out is a brave first step. You’re not alone in feeling this way, and there are ways to make new connections whenever you are ready.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Thank you for being so open and honest about what you are going through. It sounds like you are having a hard time navigating this situation. I am glad to hear that although it is hard, you admitted your actions and apologised for it. I don’t think it is easy but you did the right thing by braving through it.
Perhaps, at this point when things just happened, it is hard to move on for both you and her. Maybe that’s why she reacted in such a way and I sense your feelings of embarrassment as it did not turn out positively. Do give yourself some time to process this and be kind to yourself as you think about it. You were brave in owning your actions and please do not blame yourself for it.
I think it is natural for people to react in ways that are out of their control when they feel angry. I believe that was what happened for you in the first place. You did feel bad after that and reflected on it too. It is okay to make mistakes, we all do. And it is about learning from our mistakes that makes us a better person. This is something you went through and I want to remind you that you are not a bad person. You just acted on your emotions at that moment. With such intense feelings that you are experiencing right now, I am sure you would be more mindful in future. There is no need to be so harsh on yourself for it.
Also, it might be helpful to think about how you want to move forward from this incident. When you have a goal in mind, it is easier to identify the steps you need to take to reach your goals. If you are still feeling confused or flustered now, take your time to think about it. Just remember not to let your thoughts run wild and stop yourself from self-blame; it might lead you down a negative spiral making you feel bad about yourself. I don’t want you to feel even more stuck.
Do be mindful of how you speak to yourself and I hope you affirm yourself more. Here are some suggestions for you to consider when you are feeling negative about your actions:
2. Self-care. It can be eating and sleeping well. Having a balanced diet and being well-rested contributes to regulating mood and improving cognitive function. Take some time to engage in activities you enjoy or find ways to be good to yourself because you deserve to be treated well.
3. Positive self-talk: It is important how you speak to yourself. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself. You are not the angry person and not a bad person. You have reflected on your actions, admitted and apologised as well. Be kind to yourself as you process your feelings.
4. Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
5. Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.
You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).

Maybe next time you should try to avoid these confession pages because you cant trust em. Mindline is trustable though!
From your story, you sent a negative post so it would have received negative feedback.
It was kinda wrong of you to expose her publicly like that, but she was also wrong because she directly interrogated you as if you were some lowlife.
I wanna say that you have every right to feel that way because she also did something in the heat of the moment. To be fair though, both of you must be young adults or perhaps youths and you two should have settled this in a more mature way. You must have felt so so bad about having bad luck especially for a test. But i assure you, it’s not her. You were just feeling so low that you didnt do so well for your exam. Before taking an exam, your mental health also matters as it affects your peformance. For now, crying over spilt milk wont help. You should be happy that this is over that she didnt do anything worse to your precious self.
Im glad youre still here, alive and well. Dont let her get to you. I think you’re a sensitive person which is so adorable because your post shows you care about her feelings and felt a teeny bit guilty for what you did.
Please don’t let a small setback bring you down. Your life is worth more than you know. You deserve to experience life in its sweetness and bitterness because you are strong.

Thanks for coming on here to share about your struggles. I can see how being perceived as ‘crazy/mad’ by people close to you affecting your mood - I want you to know that what you feel is valid given the situation you’re in.
I think in this day and age, those terms should not be used in a manner that is not helpful or accurate towards anyone. I’m also curious to the context of the conversations you had with your best friend and on your socials - has this happened before? I’d like to listen if you don’t mind sharing.
It feels like the situation could be different if the other party could sorta understand instead of assuming about your thoughts - it’s as though there was a dissonance between what they expect you to be and how you actually are; and perhaps they’re trying to figure out how to explain this to themselves.
I think that friendships are important to you as you value connection. Since there’s a break in this connection, you’re feeling down as you probably feel hurt, but I think you have the self-awareness to want to do something about it. To help with the distress, you can try to:
• Be kind to yourself
• Shift (to a more helpful) perspective
And maybe consider sharing your thoughts with these people important to you in an open communication. This can happen when everyone’s not in a hurry or distracted to enable them to hear your thoughts using I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like to see happen instead). This way, you can get your concerns across and in a manner that your friends can listen and understand clearly. Also, if you feel like seeking out support, there are professionals that can work with you in a setting that is non-judgmental and safe like Family Service Centres .
Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need.

I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling down due to negative comments and the perception of others. It’s understandably distressing when people misinterpret or label your thoughts as “crazy,” especially when it affects your well-being. It’s important to recognize that individuals may perceive things differently based on their perspectives, and their comments don’t necessarily reflect the validity of your thoughts or intentions.
Consider discussing your feelings with your best friend or trusted individuals who may offer support and understanding. It might be helpful to communicate your perspective. Focusing on the positive support from your fans on social platforms might help counteract the negative comments too. Remember that staying true to yourself and seeking support from those who appreciate your perspective is crucial. If the negativity continues to impact your mental health, consider limiting exposure to such comments and seeking guidance from friends, family, or a mental health professional. Take care,",,2,,,,,

People distance themselves away from me because i am also kinda crazy or off?
I wanna tell you that the fact you have FANS on social media is something you should be proud of. It means people take that extra step to show you are valued to them. That you are beautiful, perfect to them and that’s enough. Heck, look at social media influencers nowadays. All of em are a bit delulu in their own ways and they have millions of followers. People call you crazy? Then we be crazy together! You see the viral sg vids of random uncles always picking fights in public? That’s crazy! But so what? What can people do to us? As long as we abide by the law we aren’t crazy. People think we’re crazy because we aren’t like the rest.
But we’re fricking unique. We are awesome. And that’s what makes us shine. Ignore their comments. You are living your own life and your headspace should be thinking highly of yourself and not letting their words get to you. They are happy right now and here you are sad about what they said. They have their own insecurities so they envy your crazy peronality. Dont care. They dont matter. You do. You are the main character of your own story. You can choose to drop them, or let them eat you alive.

13088,Is it normal to feel like this?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/is-it-normal-to-feel-like-this/13088,Is This Normal?,---,9589,Leow,User,,20048,1,"Hello everyone, it’s me. I want to ask all those open to discussion on whether having feelings like these are normal in a sense. Just a curious soul wanting to know more about myself and how others may portray me. Also a possible trigger warning right now.
I’ve been told that I am too ‘insensitive’, but it’s just that I am much of a logical and rational thinker with defying thoughts. I am not trying to act different from anyone else, it’s just how my brain is programmed. The world is filled to the brim with actions of evil and whatnot. Many tend to feel sympathy for the victims, SA victims, War victims, just victims in general. But to me, I feel nothing about them, and when people come up to me and go ‘‘I feel so bad…look at this poor child, her mum passed after a car crash’’. Why are you telling me this? And why should I care about her? I have this thought process ‘‘As long as me and my loved ones are not the ones affected, I do not care even if the sky falls’’ Why should I care that she is an orphan? I’m not the one affected. No point wallowing over that fact. It’s God’s will, in my opinion.
Why care about them when you can care about the people around you and yourself? That is much more important. Unless the topic is truly something I am disturbed about, only then will I sympathise. You are acting as if pitying these victims can solve whatever issue. Which I believe not, my stance of how I view the current problems of the world are like that as well.
I just wished that more humans stand on thinking much more logically and rationally. So no, I do not see myself as ‘cruel or mean’ I just simply do not care about them. You are not the one being affected why are you acting all sad? It’s foolish in my eyes in all honesty. Why are you caring about them!? Focus on you, you are still alive and kicking here, why are you pitying over some random person on this vast world with over 8 billion people? They are just another human floating on this rock we call earth. There’s no point feeling such strong emotions over some rando you don’t even know personally. As long as you’re not being affected, that’s good enough. Right?
I’m sorry if my thought process has offended everyone, but I just want to know how people feel about me. Must I really conform to societies standards of having to feel bad for everyone. I simply cannot do that, not even to myself. I don’t feel bad for myself when something tragic has happened, I just suck it up and move on till another bad thing happens and blow off some steam. I only feel bad for my family, blood is thicker than water after all.
Please, If you want, tell me what you think about this! Thank you!",,1,20067.0,,,,

It takes courage to express such personal feelings, especially when they might not align with how others think.
It’s natural for everyone to process emotions and events differently. Your logical and rational approach to life is a part of who you are, and it’s important to acknowledge that everyone has their way of coping with the world’s challenges. Feeling detached or not experiencing empathy in certain situations doesn’t necessarily make someone “insensitive” or “cruel”—it’s simply a different way of processing emotions.
That said, empathy is a complex emotion that varies greatly among individuals. For many, feeling empathy for others, even those they don’t personally know, can foster a sense of connection and compassion that helps build a supportive community. It’s also worth noting that caring about others doesn’t mean neglecting oneself or one’s loved ones—it’s possible to balance both.
Your focus on taking care of yourself and your loved ones is valid and important. However, understanding and acknowledging others’ feelings can also enrich your own experiences and relationships. It might be helpful to consider that while empathy might not come naturally to you, exploring why others feel it can provide new insights and perspectives.
Society has a range of expectations, and while you don’t have to conform to them, being aware of different viewpoints can lead to a deeper understanding of yourself and those around you. If you ever find these feelings challenging or want to explore them further, speaking with a therapist or counsellor might offer valuable insights and support.
(oops) I see you’ve posted this on Ask-a-Therapist, and while I’m no professional, I hope you stay open-minded to exploring new perspectives and I wish you all the best in your journey of self-discovery!",,1,,20048,,20048.0,

food for thought: Scientifically, we do have mirror neurons that help us empathise with others, but sometimes, not everyone experiences empathy in the same way. For some, not feeling bad when bad things happen might be a coping mechanism. It can be a way to protect oneself emotionally from the constant barrage of negative events in the world. It’s also true that we don’t always have the capacity to empathise with everyone, especially with the overwhelming amount of suffering we are exposed to.
In my non-professional opinion, as long as this way of thinking doesn’t lead to harming others, it’s okay to acknowledge that everyone experiences and processes emotions differently. It’s important to find a balance that works for you, while still being mindful of how others may perceive or be affected by your actions.",,1,,,,,

Unfortunately, most humans are emotional creatures. So even when you feel bad for your family, these are emotions that you are facing.
I get what you’re saying about societal standards making people “care” more about “bigger issues” when they should be caring about their immediate community. It’s probably a (negative) byproduct of social media where our teenagers (and us) are exposed to all these global happenings. Emotions stir and people get affected because they relate to them.
You don’t have to conform to society’s standards. Maybe you have had feedback from others but I’d say stick to what you believe in. Do the best for the people you love and if energy permits, try convincing people around you to do the same too. But even if you can’t convince others, that’s alright too - we can all co-exist with different ideologies.", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/is-it-normal-to-feel-like-this/13088/1,0,,20048,,,20048

Firstly, what a wonderful insight you’ve shared. I want to take a moment to appreciate the way you wrote your post. It was thoughtful, with many “I” statements. Well done. The topic you addressed is sensitive, yet you found a way to express your needs without offending anyone. That is a commendable skill, and I am proud of you.
It sounds to me like you may be someone who has taken the time to reflect and make your own meaning of the world. I get the sense that on one hand, you’d like to feel a little similar to everyone else, while on the other, you’d also like to stay authentic to your views.
Having logical and rational thinking is a valuable skill, and you are right—some people’s brains are programmed that way, and there is no shame or judgment in that. With so many things going wrong in the world, it makes sense to focus on our own survival and those we care about. It’s part of our human evolution to prioritise our immediate circle because their well-being directly impacts us.
I’d like to invite you to reflect on whether your reduced empathy might be due to being exposed to a lot of sensory stimulation of pain and hurt (even in your early years), making your brain numb to others’ suffering as a coping mechanism. Or is it more about situations that are out of your control? For example, if a friend was emotionally hurt, how would you respond?
Here are some journal prompts for self-reflection:
2. Think about a recent situation where someone shared their pain with you. How did you react, and why do you think you reacted that way?
3. Reflect on a time when you felt empathy for someone. What was different about that situation compared to times when you did not feel empathetic?
4. Consider your close relationships. How do you show empathy and support to those you care about, and how does it affect your relationship with them?
If I may clarify, when you say, “I feel so bad… look at this poor child, her mum passed after a car crash. Why are you telling me this? And why should I care about her?”
This is more about experiencing sympathy rather than empathy. Check out this video for more about empathy.
Empathy is a superpower and a wonderful trait to possess. It allows us to build connections and relationships. When we empathise, we can innovate and come up with creative solutions. Some of the world’s greatest changes or inventions came about because someone empathised with someone else’s pain. This ability to connect through pain helps us do better as humans. Here are some examples:
- Braille System: Louis Braille, who was blind himself, invented the Braille system to provide visually impaired people with a means of reading and writing. His empathy for others facing the same challenges drove him to create a life-changing tool.
- Vaccines: Edward Jenner’s development of the smallpox vaccine was driven by his desire to prevent the suffering caused by this deadly disease. His empathy for the victims of smallpox led to one of the most important public health tools in history.
- Hearing Aid: Miller Reese Hutchison invented the first electric hearing aid to help his friend who was hearing impaired. His empathy and desire to improve his friend’s quality of life led to this important device.
- Public Libraries: Andrew Carnegie, inspired by his belief in the power of education and empathy for those without access to knowledge, funded the creation of public libraries around the world, making education and information accessible to all.
- Sign Language: Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet developed American Sign Language (ASL) to educate the deaf after being inspired by a young deaf girl. His empathy and dedication to improving communication for the deaf community led to the widespread use of sign language.
- Mother’s Day: Anna Jarvis initiated the campaign for Mother’s Day in honour of her mother, Ann Reeves Jarvis, who cared for wounded soldiers and worked to improve public health. Anna’s empathy for her mother’s work and the role of mothers everywhere led to the creation of this now globally celebrated day.
Yes, you are right, empathy alone won’t solve others’ problems, but it allows them to feel less alone, more connected, and hopeful for a better tomorrow. It’s a great first step towards solving something.
To answer your question, in my personal opinion, no one should have to conform to something that isn’t their authentic self. Trying to conform will most likely result in feeling resentful or bitter in the long run. However, I do hope that with time you will also allow your empathy muscle to grow stronger. The ability to connect with others in their time of pain and difficulty, even if you don’t know them personally, is a superpower that helps us be more humane and kind to one another.
Yes, you are also right that there is a saying, “Blood is thicker than water,” but this isn’t the full quote. It is often misunderstood. The full saying is: “The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.” This suggests that the bonds we choose and create (the blood of the covenant) are stronger than those we are born into (the water of the womb).
Perhaps, like this famous saying, we may also have a limited view or understanding of something, and there is always room to grow our awareness at a pace comfortable to us.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Thank you for reaching out to us. I’m sorry to hear that you’ve been experiencing strong uncomfortable feelings for some time now. I can only imagine how difficult it must be for you. I’m glad you know you don’t have to navigate this alone, and seeking help is a significant and courageous decision. Well done!
While I can’t provide a diagnosis, I can share some information that might help you understand your symptoms better. Many of the feelings you’re experiencing are common signs of depression. Feeling low intermittently, persistent helplessness and hopelessness, fatigue despite getting enough rest, lack of motivation, difficulty getting out of bed, and a lack of joy in daily life are all typical symptoms.
It’s important to note that depression can come and go, and it’s not always a constant feeling of sadness. These symptoms seem to be impacting your daily living and quality of life, making it worth exploring further. You deserve to live well and without a prolonged sense of helplessness and hopelessness. Living a life where you can be your authentic self is possible, and it’s okay to get support with it.
Given that these feelings have been ongoing for years and worsen with stress, I’d like to strongly encourage you to seek professional help. You may want to schedule an appointment to meet with a psychiatrist or reach out to a psychologist or counsellor for support and care. You can walk into any polyclinic to speak with a doctor and then get a referral to the mental health team.
In the meantime, here are a few steps you can consider:
- Talk to Someone You Trust: Sharing your feelings with a friend or family member can be a good first step.
- Self-Care: Try to engage in activities that you usually enjoy, even if they don’t bring the same joy they once did. Regular exercise, healthy eating, and adequate sleep can also help.
- Mindfulness and Relaxation: Practices like deep breathing, meditation, or even just going for a walk can help regulate the nervous system, clear your mind, and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.
Reaching out for help is a significant and brave step. You don’t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can help you find a way forward. As the saying goes, “Within you, there is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time and be yourself.” Serenity is within you, and though chaos may be present now, it is only temporary. You can find your peace again.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I am sorry to hear about your struggles at home and thank you for coming here to share with us. It sounds difficult to have such experiences and I cannot imagine how you have been coping with this.
It seems like your son has issues with managing himself when he is angry and it has been happening over the past 10 years. Has he seek support before and I wonder if you have talked to people about this as well? I hear your concerns about you and your family’s safety when your son gets angry and starts breaking things in the house. While you mentioned that he has not hurt you or your family, it can affect all of you emotionally.
I am not sure if you have considered seeking support on his behalf. It might be helpful for your son to learn some coping techniques to cope with when he is angry. It is for the safety for you and your family as well. While you might have concerns about triggering him and possibly causing hurt, it could be more helpful to you and everyone in your family in the long run. You can look into the services and you can check with them on the processes before you give consent to them before they follow up on your case. They may even provide you with some advice regarding your consideration in applying for a PPO.
Here are some resources for you to consider:
National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline (24 hours hotline): 1800-777-0000
PAVE - Integrated service for family violence, child protection and sexual abuse: 6555 0390
It sounds like you feel desperate at this moment and maybe that’s why you had thoughts about ending it all. I am glad to hear of your protective factors, like your youngest son and starting a new career. These are things that are very important to you and I hope you focus more on them. You might want to consider seeking support as well, to help with your coping when you feel anxious and overwhelmed.
I have a few techniques to share below, which you can try when you are feeling stressed.
2. Deep breathing: Sit yourself in a comfortable position. Take a deep breath and let it out slowly. Do it a few times until you feel better.
3. Self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and let yourself know that you are doing your best for you and your family.
4. Engage in activities that you enjoy. Give yourself a positive distraction and possibly a sense of achievement.
5. Talk to someone. Take some time to talk to your friends or a trusted family member to help yourself gain new insights or emotional support.
6. Stretch out. Do a few simple stretches to relieve muscle tension and possibly improve your mood.
If you are open to seeking professional support, you may also consider the following options.

In terms of coping, how much time do you have to spend together with your son? You mentioned that he is holding 3 jobs, and that you will be starting a new career soon. Perhaps this could be an opportunity for you to create a bit more distance from this son, and you could have your husband and other children join you in spending time outside of the house, away from your 27 year old, for the safety of you and your family.
Minimizing the number of objects available for your son to break, putting stick on sound dampeners on the doors that you get from hardware stores could also be useful practical measures to help reduce stress for yourself. Or even buying earplugs for you and your family while you sleep. Anything to help you survive until the PPO goes through! Do let me know your thoughts, we can brainstorm ideas together.

The thing is like I mentioned he starts his nuisances after 12pm till early morning when the family needs to sleep.He purposely picks up that time to create the noise,banging and breaking.
He usually breaks my bidets,shower pipes ,toilet door,gates etc which cannot be moved or disabled.
I can try the earplugs but the moment he starts my anxiety starts.
At times he goes for a couple of days break and juat when I feel at peace he would start again and that really unwinds me and starts my panic attcks.
I hope I get my PPO soon and am worried about the percussions of serving the PPO.
Day by day i am just hoping that i would be killed in a car accident etc to end this",,1,,,,,

I wonder if it would help to prioritize your concerns in this situation, and then ask for recommendations from your caseworker at PAVE. For example, in order of importance,
2. You should absolutely ensure that you and your family members are physically safe and unharmed. If he violates this, calling the police to ensure the safety of you and your loved ones might be necessary.
3. Ensuring that you are able to get adequate rest. If you are unable to get rest, perhaps moving in with another relative temporarily until the PPO goes through might be helpful? Just so that you can rest and function at your new workplace.
4. Preventing damage to the house. Unfortunately, unless your son is moved out of the house this doesn’t seem to be possible.
You’ve mentioned how difficult things are and how you’ve considered thoughts of dying as an escape. I hope that you find the strength inside you to continue despite these hardships, as you still have a family that relies on you.
You mentioned that you’re afraid if your son gets served summons, and what will happen after the PPO. Can I ask what you are afraid of in these scenarios?",,1,,,,,

Thanks for coming here to share your struggles with us. It takes a lot of courage to be so vulnerable and open in sharing such strong emotions, and I want to commend you on that.
It sounds like you are struggling with weight loss for some time, and it is making you feel helpless and frustrated despite the effort you have put in. This could explain the lack of motivation in achieving your weight loss goals, thus finding it difficult to keep up with the routine you have set for yourself. There are many factors as to why it is hard to get the desired outcome you want for yourself, like genetic, lifestyle, age etc. Sometimes, it can be helpful to take your mind off and step off the weighing scale for a while because it can be discouraging and makes you feel emotional. It might be helpful to give yourself a break or a distraction for some time too.
I would like to share some suggestions towards your situation, and I hope it will be helpful.
2. Be patient with yourself. Do acknowledge that losing weight can be difficult due to external factors. It doesn’t mean that you are not doing well. It takes time and sometimes the progress can be slow. When you are too harsh or critical towards yourself, it could work against your desired outcome and cause you to feel more discouraged.
3. Celebrate small victories. While you might not be able to eat healthily or sleep early on certain days, I am sure there are days when you can commit to it. Itis important to acknowledge your effort during such times to keep yourself going.
4. Focus more on your health. Even if you do not see significant results on the weighing scale, it does not mean that you are not progressing. Every healthy choice you make is significant and important towards your goals.
5. Balance yourself. Having a balance might help in increasing motivation. Sometimes, it is okay to indulge a little, while other days you try to keep healthy. Having such balance can help in boosting your mood and not feel guilty on days when you don’t adhere to the routine.
6. Plan for small actionable steps. Having a desired goal is helpful in identifying what we want. However, if it seems difficult to achieve, it could likely backfire. When you see that the goal is too far and hard to reach, the motivation to do something could be lesser. Thus it is important to set more achievable for yourself and adjust as you progress.
I hope this is helpful and you find the motivation to lead a healthy lifestyle, not just for your weight but for your body too. All the best and take care!",,0,,20020,,20020.0,

Your stage name sounds inspiring! Thanks for sharing the meaning of it! It sounds like you are struggling with your feelings as you have encountered a challenge that makes you reconsider your talents. It must be difficult feeling this way as you have been putting in a lot of effort through the years.
It is definitely tough when things do not go as expected. I hope you know that 1 event does not represent your entire career, nor does it define your worth or skills. Maybe you are doubting yourself right now because of what happened and you need support to believe in yourself again. It is perfectly normal to feel this way seeing how the performance is so important to you.
Perhaps we can try different ways to get you back up again and learn to trust yourself.
2. Reflect on your past achievements and acknowledge the effort you have put in over the years. By acknowledging these experiences, you are giving yourself a wider lens to look at the situation. Right now, you seem to be so focused on the recent event, thus forgetting how talented you have been.
3. Positive support. It might be helpful to talk to people who can support you and believe in you. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need. Sometimes talking to people can provide emotional support and perhaps a different perspective to your situation.
4. Acknowledge your emotions. Know that what you are feeling now is valid and allow them to flow without judgement. It is okay to feel sad, frustrated or disappointed.
5. Be kind to yourself. Remind yourself that it is a setback and you are much more worthy. Engage in activities that makes you feel good about yourself.
6. Setting goals. Break down your goals into small actionable steps to rebuild your confidence. This can also help you in identifying a sense of purpose in what you do.
7. Continue visits to the psychologist and keep up with medication. It is good to know that you are already seeking support and being on regular medication to maintain your mood. Maintenance and consistency is helpful in improving your situation.
I really hope you get the strength to stand up and perform again. We cannot appeal to everyone, so it is helpful to focus on the right audience. Take care and all the best!",,1,,19999,,19999.0,

Thanks for coming here to share your concerns with us. It sounds like you are feeling rather down about life and it is difficult to navigate as you don’t have an outlet to share your feelings. I want to affirm you for being so courageous to share your thoughts with us.
Well, it is true that most people have lesser friends as they grow older. It is possibly because we get more selective of our choices in friendships and connections, thus spending less time and energy with people whom we feel might not be helpful or supportive to us. Also, it might be having similar concerns like you have, about not wanting to bother your friends due to their personal life. It shows how much you treasure your friendships and how considerate you are.
In another perspective, if you try opening up to a friend, there could be a possibility that your friend is feeling this way too. He or she might be afraid of bothering you, thus not talking to you about their concerns, so it might be a 2-way communication instead. We could all think the same way but somehow it divides us rather than connects us. Maybe you can consider sharing your concerns and see how it goes.
Perhaps you can also take some time to reflect on your work environment as well. From your sharing, it sounds like your work and colleagues have been making you feel bad about your situation. It is definitely hurtful to hear people say things like that. Do you think you would be open to ask them openly about this? If you do, you can consider calming yourself first before speaking with them so you do not sound defensive or emotional. Express your feelings about how you felt when you heard it and seek clarifications/feedback from them. If the feedback is constructive, you can take them into consideration and look into what can be done to make things better. If you find that you do not agree, it is okay to set boundaries and distance yourself too.
Do give yourself positive affirmations from time to time. When you are aware of your strengths, you might feel better about yourself. You can consider journaling as a way to know yourself better too. It also might help in stopping the negative spiral of emotions.

On loneliness, I definitely agree that it’s harder to make friends when you’re older. We make most of our friends during school life when everything was more chill. Do you have hobbies outside of work? That could be a good place to start making new friends.
On being overwhelmed at work, is it the lack of social connection that makes you feel depressed or is it just the work or workload itself? If it’s about work or workload, maybe can try talking to your manager? If it’s about social connection then it might be a bit harder, need to build trust and rapport over time with your colleagues.

It’s really important to find some outlet for your feelings. Try exploring new places, picking up new hobbies, and making new connections.

I’m having doubts about my life ever since I was a kid and recently my parents divorced… Since I was a kid, I’ve been bullied by my brother both mentally and physically and called vile stuff on me… One time he wanted to see my private parts (I don’t know why he did that) and when I refused he punched me in the eye and right cheek and so I did it out of fear… I hated my brother back then and hated him now since he’s making my mom miserable…
And then my parents got divorced… Every time I talked about something… it’s always redirected towards their divorced life and always asked me if my mom did the right thing…
I’ve been on edge since then… Smoking just to numb the pain… Sometimes I just wanna flip the switch y’know… Just… Sleep… For like 5-6 years or forever… It feels like I’m the reason that they got divorced and often bullied… Not the right time to exist if you can call it that…
Sometimes I just wanna run away from home and live somewhere or be homeless somewhere… Away from all of that… But there’s a mental block that kept me from doing that…

Thanks for sharing your struggles with us and it is helpful that you are reaching out for support. It feels like you have been hurt and in pain for a long time without people knowing or acknowledging your pain. I cannot imagine how you have been coping with such strong emotions for so long.
There seems to be a few concerns you shared. First, it is the physical, verbal and sexual abuse from your brother. What he did was wrong and you were right to reject his request. I am sorry to hear that he intensified his approach and you had to relent. It must be difficult to process such memories of the situation. It takes so much courage for you to be sharing this now and I want to remind you that whatever happened was not your fault. You did not do anything to cause this and it is important to know that. I am not sure what happened after that, like whether you told anyone about it and if you ever receive any support at that time. If you still feel affected by this incident, it might be helpful to reach out to a professional for support on how to navigate around this and work through your feelings. You do not need to be alone in this journey.
Also, it seems like the divorce is rather stressful for you as the adults in the family are more focused on their own issues and potentially neglecting your feelings. It is valid to feel like running away from home, from all these problems. It feels too much to handle at this moment and there is lack of support from family. You might find that you are blaming yourself and thinking if you are the reason for the divorce, and it could be due to a subconscious need to gain some control over the situation. Through such chaos and not having a say in these family circumstances, our brain would grasp any opportunity to feel in control. Thus, the self blame comes in to bring in a forged sense of responsibility, in order to feel that you can change something. This becomes unhelpful because you could be focused on the things that are out of your control, making you feel more stuck and frustrated. I want to let you know that when divorce happens, it is not because of the children, but more because of the adults who cannot work things through on their own. It is unfair when children take on this responsibility because there is little you can do to make their relationship better.
Do take time to focus more on what you can do to support yourself during this period. Acknowledge your own feelings and prioritize your needs because you are important. I am concerned about you and how you are coping. If you are open to seeing a professional for support, here are some resources for you to consider:

Thank you for taking time to share your current situation. It does sound like you have been thinking about life for some time. I would like to know what you really want in your life, like what makes you happy, what are your goals and dreams? And what is keeping you from working towards them?
I would really like to support you in finding the answers that you are seeking, and I wonder what motivates you in life. Perhaps you can think about what has helped you to achieve the things you have currently, like your job and your connections (family/friends).
Being able to hold a stable job for 3 years take commitment and perhaps fulfilment or passion. It might be helpful to think about what kept you going and not give up even when you feel lazy or not motivated. Take some time to think about your past goals and dreams; and to consider the reasons that helped you achieve them. I think you are strong and resilient in your own ways, possibly the reasons that have helped you survived thus far.
It is normal to think about life; the existence, purpose and what matters to them. I am sure everyone has been through tough periods in life and have reflected on their lives during those periods. Remind yourself of your strengths and do the things that you enjoy doing. Remember not to lose sight of your goals, so that you can find your direction and motivation, and possibly the answers you are looking for.

It sounds incredibly tough to have these goals and dreams but to feel unable to pursue them. Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed by it all. You’re not pathetic—acknowledging how you feel is an important step.
I can’t say I have all the answers, but you did mention that you don’t think life is meaningless. Hmm…it sounds like there’s something you do wish to have and achieve. You also mentioned that you can’t bring yourself to put any meaningful effort—what’s meaningful to you?

I’m sorry to hear about what you’re going through. It takes a lot of strength to confront such a painful situation and to reach out for support. Feeling paranoid and miserable after discovering infidelity is a natural reaction. Trust, once broken, is challenging to rebuild.
Open and honest communication is key to resolving issues in a relationship. Have a candid conversation with your partner about your fears and insecurities. Discussing how you both can rebuild trust is crucial. This might involve setting boundaries, seeking reassurance, or even considering counselling. Sometimes, seeking guidance from a professional counsellor can provide a neutral space to discuss your feelings and offer strategies to help rebuild trust and navigate your emotions.
Take time to reflect on what you need to feel secure and happy in the relationship. Ask yourself if you can truly forgive and move past this betrayal. Observe if your partner is showing consistent, trustworthy behaviour and if both of you are willing to put in the effort to rebuild the relationship. It’s also worthwhile to consider how the relationship broke down to the point where infidelity occurred. Were there any red flags that were overlooked that need to be addressed?
To assist you in gaining clarity on whether you should leave or stay, here are some journal prompts for your consideration:
2. What are my core values in a relationship, and has this situation compromised them?
3. Can I genuinely see myself trusting my partner again? What would it take to rebuild that trust?
4. What are the positive aspects of this relationship that I would miss if it ended?
5. Are there patterns or red flags in this relationship that have been consistently troubling?
6. How does staying in this relationship affect my mental and emotional well-being?
7. What would my ideal relationship look like, and does this relationship align with that vision?
8. Am I staying out of fear of being alone, or because I believe this relationship can truly be healthy and fulfilling?
9. How would I feel one year from now if nothing changed in this relationship?
Some couples are able to rebuild their relationship after infidelity, while others find it too difficult to move past the betrayal. Both outcomes are valid and have their own place, with no judgement. Ultimately, the decision to stay or leave should be based on your well-being and happiness. Whether you decide to stay or leave, focus on your personal growth and healing. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, and engage in activities that bring you joy and peace.
There’s no right or wrong answer, only what’s best for you. Take the time to reflect, communicate openly, and seek support if needed. Your happiness and emotional well-being are the most important factors in making this decision.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter! Wishing you strength and clarity.

Then eventually i gotten a tiny improvement and when i told my parents about it they were not even surprised, they were like oh okay and didn’t even bothered about it. Now im a sec 4 student taking my national exams soon, over the 3 years i had major improvement in my grades especially in math from my psle grade I had a E for my math but when I entered sec school my understanding in math started to improve but eventually i had to switch to a more advance class bc i gotten better grades, but when I entered the new class my grades in math automatically drops💀 my parents was happy i was getting to a better class but unfortunately i had to drop to the weak class again bc of it ofc my parents was like, why u dw stay? I also dk?? My grades like drop and I didn’t feel happy about it and the class was going on a fast pace of learning. But when I drop to the weak class my grades improve again. Suddenly my parents were like giving me praises( eg. good job, see im proud of u) but I don’t feel anything. Like everytime they say that I would be like ok lor. Even during skool
For an example my math cher gave me my math results back( A grade) I didn’t even feel anything all I was like ok lor A oni right I really dk how to like express it bc im so used to getting bad grades since young and suddenly getting good and getting praises??

It’s clear you’ve worked really hard to improve, and it’s understandable to feel mixed emotions about the journey and the feedback you’ve received.
I can relate to some of what you’re feeling. When we’ve struggled with something for a long time, sudden improvements and changes in how others react to us can feel confusing and even hollow. It’s like your efforts weren’t fully acknowledged when you needed it most, and now that you’re doing better, the praise might feel a bit too late or insincere.
We often forget that our self-worth shouldn’t be tied solely to grades. The fact that you’ve improved so much in math shows your resilience and determination, and that’s something to be proud of, regardless of external validation.
You might find it helpful to talk to someone about these feelings, whether it’s a trusted teacher, counsellor, or even a friend. Expressing these emotions can sometimes make them easier to understand and manage.
Wishing you all the best with your upcoming national exams and beyond. Keep believing in yourself and your abilities.

Thank you for opening up and sharing your feelings here. Going through the ups and downs of grades, while dealing with various reactions and expectations from your parents and teachers, must have been incredibly challenging. It’s tough to put in effort, face criticism, and then feel disconnected even when you succeed. Your feelings of confusion and emotional numbness are completely understandable given these experiences.
I’m sorry to hear that your parents’ reactions have been inconsistent, which can be really confusing. It might help to shift your focus onto recognising your own achievements and strengths, rather than relying solely on external validation from others.
Let’s also take a moment to celebrate your incredible achievement—from an E grade to an A grade over four years! This shows tremendous daily perseverance and resilience. Showing up day after day, even when it felt hopeless, is a huge accomplishment. You’ve demonstrated incredible strength, dedication, and determination. Well done! Your ability to keep pushing forward and adapt to new challenges is truly inspiring.
We all have different learning styles. Some teachers use strategies that align more closely with our own learning styles, which can help us learn better and improve our grades. Which class is considered “better” or “worse” is just a perception. At the end of the day, it’s about measuring your wins and not the gap. Celebrating how you improve yourself day by day is far more valuable than being in the best class.
Here are some self-reflection journal prompts to help you evaluate what the different class teachers did that helped you learn better:
- What teaching methods did I find most helpful in each class?
- How did the pace of the class affect my understanding and retention of the material?
- What specific strategies did my teachers use that made the material easier to understand?
- How did the classroom environment and teacher’s attitude impact my learning and motivation?
- In what ways did I feel more supported or challenged in each class?
I hope that reflecting on this helps you see that there was never anything wrong with you. It was just that the teaching style and strategy weren’t right for you. When you moved to a class that matched your learning style better, you were able to make progress. It’s important to remember that your self-worth and self-esteem aren’t based on grades or how others see you.
Think of it like a bottle of water. At a convenience store, it might cost $1, but in a fancy restaurant or at a concert, it can cost much more. The water inside is the same, but the price changes based on where it is. Similarly, your self-worth doesn’t change. If you aren’t being valued, it might be the environment or the strategies that need to change, not your self-worth.
Emotional numbness is a protective response your mind uses to shield you from overwhelming pain. Feeling emotionless or numb can be a response to prolonged stress or disappointment. When you’ve faced continuous criticism or pressure, it’s normal for your mind to try to protect itself by becoming less sensitive to emotions. It must have been tough to feel unheard and unseen despite giving your best effort, and this numbness likely developed to help you cope with that. Remember, this is a normal reaction, and you can learn to move past it with time and effort. Here are some strategies to help you deal with emotional numbness:
- Practise Self-Compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding during difficult times. Remind yourself that your feelings are valid and that it’s okay to take things one step at a time.
- Acknowledge Your Efforts: Remember that the hard work and effort you’ve put into improving your grades are significant. Even if it doesn’t always feel rewarding, the progress you’ve made is real and commendable.
- Positive Affirmations: Remind yourself of your strengths and worthiness. Affirmations like “I am resilient and capable of overcoming challenges” or “I am deserving of love and understanding” can help shift your mindset towards self-compassion.
- Celebrate Small Wins: Give yourself credit for your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. Over time, this can help you build a more positive and balanced emotional response to success and challenges.
- Seek Support: Talk to a therapist, school counsellor, or a trusted teacher. They can provide guidance and support as you work through your emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.
- Journal Your Thoughts: Writing can be a powerful tool for self-reflection. Here are three journal prompts to help you explore your emotions:
What situations or interactions trigger feelings of numbness for me?
How do I usually respond when I feel emotionally numb? Are there patterns in my reactions?
What activities or experiences help me reconnect with my emotions and feel more grounded?
- What situations or interactions trigger feelings of numbness for me?
- How do I usually respond when I feel emotionally numb? Are there patterns in my reactions?
- What activities or experiences help me reconnect with my emotions and feel more grounded?
- Engage in Creative Activities: Activities like drawing, painting, or playing music can help you express emotions that are difficult to put into words.
- Mindfulness and Relaxation: Practising mindfulness or relaxation techniques can help you reconnect with your emotions and reduce feelings of emptiness. Simple activities like deep breathing, meditation, or even taking a walk can make a difference.
2. What situations or interactions trigger feelings of numbness for me?
3. How do I usually respond when I feel emotionally numb? Are there patterns in my reactions?
4. What activities or experiences help me reconnect with my emotions and feel more grounded?
You have a national exam coming up in the months ahead, and it’s normal to feel increasing pressure as the dates approach. Remember, grades simply reflect the gap in skills or knowledge and do not define your self-worth. You are amazing and filled with endless potential. As you continue to discover and harness your strengths, there’s no limit to what you can achieve.
When you feel ready, comfortable and safe, consider sharing your feelings with your parents. This conversation might help them understand how their unintentional actions have affected you. Hopefully, this understanding will lead to positive changes in how they support and show love to you.
Congratulations once again on bridging the gap in your math skills. Remember, grades are merely numbers and letters; what truly matters is the effort, resilience, and skills you’ve demonstrated in your journey of learning and growth. Let’s celebrate your perseverance and courage to tackle difficult tasks and navigate challenging emotions for a greater reward in the future—that’s what we call delayed gratification. These are invaluable life skills, and it’s clear that you are already getting very good at them at just Sec 4.

Thank you for coming here to share your feelings with us. I’m sorry you’re feeling this way, I’m guessing it may feel a little lonely being in this state. It’s completely normal to feel lost and unsure about your purpose at times. It takes a lot of courage to open up about feeling lost and unsure. I’m really glad you reached out.
You mentioned feeling like an emotionless puppet, which sounds like your nervous system might be in a freeze state. There are four main states our nervous system can be in: fight, flight, freeze, and fawn. When we’re in the freeze state, we might feel numb or disconnected from our emotions and body. To help bring sensation back to your body and slowly move out of the freeze state, try these three actionable steps:
2. Deep Breathing Exercises: Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nervous system. Focus on breathing in for a count of four, holding for four, and exhaling for four.
3. Grounding Techniques: Engage in grounding activities like walking barefoot on grass, holding a piece of ice, or focusing on the details of your surroundings to reconnect with your body and the present moment.
4. Physical Movement: Gentle physical activities like stretching, yoga, or tai chi can help release tension and bring awareness back to your body.
Together with the above-mentioned strategy, it’s also important to acknowledge your feelings. It’s okay to feel lost and unsure. Accepting these feelings is the first step towards understanding them.
Practise, self-love and kindness towards yourself. Next, try exploring your interests by engaging in different activities and hobbies to see what excites you. Sometimes, new experiences can help you discover what you enjoy and care about. Also, instead of focusing on big life decisions, set small, achievable goals daily. This can give you a sense of direction and accomplishment.
Sometimes it’s more helpful to talk to someone, like a friend, family member, or counsellor, who can provide support and new perspectives, helping you see things more clearly.
Most importantly, please be patient with yourself. It’s okay to take time to figure things out. Life is a journey, and it’s perfectly fine to explore and find your way at your own pace. Our concept of self naturally evolves as we grow and experience different things in life. It’s okay if you don’t fully know yourself at this moment; you have the opportunity to gradually take back control and shape your identity. You can learn to get back into the driver’s seat of your life and slowly mould and decide what or who you want to be.
If you feel comfortable to share, please let us know who might be the puppet master holding on to your strings. If you could be free from this influence, what would you like to do or not do anymore?

Thank you for replying and sharing this with us. I can only imagine how challenging it must be for you. It’s really tough when family dynamics create situations where responsibilities aren’t shared equally, and some members feel unfairly burdened. It’s important to remember that individuating from your family of origin can feel uncomfortable, and it’s okay to assert your own needs and boundaries for your wellbeing.
Respecting self-set boundaries is crucial for healthy relationships and personal well-being. Boundaries define where you end and others begin, helping to establish limits that protect your physical, emotional, and mental health. When you respect your own boundaries and those of others, you establish clear expectations and foster mutual respect, which strengthens trust and communication in relationships. It empowers you to honour your needs and priorities without feeling guilty or overwhelmed, reducing stress and maintaining a healthier balance in life.
Asserting your boundaries builds self-confidence and improves self-esteem, as you learn to advocate for yourself in a respectful manner. This approach also helps navigate conflicts effectively and maintain emotional stability, promoting healthier interactions and contributing to a more fulfilling life where you can achieve greater joy and satisfaction.
While it’s wonderful that you help out of kindness, it’s important to recognise that if you don’t respect your own boundaries, you might end up feeling burnt out or numb as you have shared. Accepting the family situation as it is and realising that you can only control your own behaviour and emotions is key.
I hope you’ll give yourself the permission, to not be responsible for other people’s emotions, even if they are older than you. It’s okay to have empathy, but respecting your own needs and boundaries will allow you to approach things differently and find joy in your life in the long run. Perhaps in seeing your courage, they may learn that it’s also okay for them to hold better boundaries.

I am experiencing severe anxiety over my child’s non-chalent attitude towards PSLE preparation. Child set goals but recent examination results showed that there are still gaps to bridge. And yet, child is not making use of the June holiday for revision, wasting time with distractions like phone and TV. Also not staying focused when doing work. Child’s actions are increasing my internal anxiety and yet I cannot do anything as constant reminders had backfired, child got defiant and aggressive. now taking a backseat and withholding my nags, but it is making me very worried and anxious. Especially when school holidays is ending and he has no time to revise to close the gap and hit his personal goals.",,1,,,,,

Thanks for sharing your concerns with us through this platform. It sounds like you are feeling rather stressed about your child’s academic journey and you feel frustrated because you are stuck in this situation.
Having worries about children is completely normal and it is because you want the best for your child. Seeing the lack of motivation and effort on his part must be difficult to deal with as he does not seem to acknowledge your care and concern for him. I want to remind you that you are a good parent and you are doing your best to ensure that he has a less stressful future.
I wonder if you have talked to him about how he feels regarding his studies and explore what are some goals he has in mind. Sometimes, children may be facing challenges that they do not dare to express or discuss with parents. You may consider having an open and honest conversation to understand his perspectives and how he feels about his studies.
If possible, discuss a reasonable routine to balance his free time and revision. This can be a good way to guide your child on time management and perhaps manage his studies better. Do ensure that there is time allocated for rest and recreation as well to avoid burn-out.
Also, you may want to consider thinking about your expectations too. Sometimes, children may feel stressed with parents’ expectations of them and this could lead to procrastination or a ‘freeze’ response. This could cause them to avoid studying and it works against you and your child. When you are able to communicate this with him and trust him with the process, it might be helpful in his academic journey. While PSLE is definitely a stressful period for both parents and children, do know that it is not something that defines their entire life.
Providing encouragement and support can be beneficial as well. While the results may not be as expected, it is helpful to the child when you affirm and acknowledge his effort.
I hope this is helpful and that things get better for you and your child. Do take care of yourself too while you navigate this difficult and stressful period.",,1,,19884,,19884.0,

We had multiple conversations on goal-setting and even came out with a revision schedule. The irony is while he seems to understand that he needs to work a bit harder to achieve the academic goals for himself, he is not taking the appropriate actions. I ever told him to lower his target so that his stress level can be reduced but he objects to it strongly.
I have been self-talking to myself that he could be overwhelmed with the workload and is stressed but that did not help me from being less anxious,
I have also adopted a less nagging approach to remind him to do his revision, hoping that it will help to alleviate some stress and he will get his act together but it does not seem to be working too.

It sounds like you’re going through a very challenging time, and it’s clear how much you care about your child’s well-being and success. As someone who struggled with studying for national exams, I found breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to be helpful. It might also be worth focusing on possible underlying issues contributing to the lack of motivation. Personally, the fear of failure overwhelmed me, and I ended up giving up on studying —— I’m sure it was tough for my parents to see. But after a while, I decided to focus on subjects that I liked and deemed important to my future at that time. Despite not doing “well” for my PSLE, my educational pathway turned out fine.
I would like to say that, as important as the PSLE is, it’s not the end of the world. It’s simply a milestone, and there are many more to come. Letting your son know he’s supported by you is far more important than the grades.
You’re doing a great job by being proactive and seeking ways to support your child. Wishing you and your child all the best as you navigate through this together.",,1,,19898,,19898.0,

Thanks for sharing your experience and your insight.
He appeared to be giving up on himself even though I had come up with small tasks for him in the revision plan. After what u shared, I think the possible underlying reason is the fear of not meeting his own expectation.
He does not open up his innermost feelings but I guess this is the most possible given his ego and pride.
You were a sensible child back then as u did pick yourself up and focus on subjects for the exam preparation.
Would you be able to share how u manage to realize this, is there anything your parents when they saw that u gave up on your studies back then?

Reflecting on my own experience, I was quite stubborn and wanted to prove my parents wrong. They valued education highly, while I didn’t as much at the time. However, I did understand the importance of the PSLE in determining my next steps.
What helped me was realising the significance of the exam on my own terms. My parents’ approach was to create a supportive environment and reduce pressure, which allowed me to focus more effectively.
Considering his resistance to advice, one resource that might offer helpful strategies is “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” by Stephen R. Covey. It emphasises principles like proactive behaviour and understanding others, which could provide new perspectives on motivation and self-management.
It can be really frustrating when someone resists advice, but patience and understanding can make a big difference. Maybe focusing on emotional support and suggesting insightful reads like this could help him overcome his fears and resistance.

You mentioned that “he has no time to revise to close the gap and hit his personal goals,” and “I am at a total loss as to how I can help him hit his academic goals.” What are the specific goals he has for PSLE? Is he aiming to improve by a grade or to move from a failing grade to an A?
It might be helpful to have an open conversation with him about the kind of support he needs. This not only helps him feel in control and lets you into his world, but also allows you to understand his perspective. If his goals are ambitious, like moving from a failing grade to an A, external resources such as tuition or a PSLE boot camp could be considered.
Although it might seem like a cliché, constantly reminding him to study or telling him not to play can sometimes discourage him from studying when he is about to. It’s important to trust him to manage his time with gentle guidance. Additionally, acknowledging and celebrating any progress, no matter how small, could help boost his confidence and motivation.
Another important aspect is to address your own anxiety. Taking care of your mental well-being will enable you to provide better support for him. There are resources on the mindline.sg platform that you could explore.

He is not far from meeting his personal goals of As. In the recent exams, he lost marks mainly due to careless mistakes. There are some gaps within the P6 topics that he needs to bridge, and also I personally believe that ample and consistent preparation is needed, regardless of where he stands now in terms of grades. But he does not seem to be putting any effort now towards his revision, constantly on the screen. On occasions when I manage to go through his work with him, his focus is not there and he gets very irritable.
You are absolutely right about the part where I need to trust him to manage his time. However, emotionally, I am very affected when I see him not spending the time effectively.

I’m sorry to hear you are feeling stressed. Thank you for sharing your situation. It takes a lot of courage to open up about such challenges, and it’s great that you’re already planning to work part-time to help lessen the load on your family. Balancing university studies, part-time work, and family expectations shows your strength and resilience.
It’s important to recognise the validity of your uncomfortable feelings while navigating these responsibilities. Simultaneously, consider that your parents may have approached you for various reasons beyond simply sharing stress. They might have aimed to be transparent about the family’s financial situation, sought your understanding and empathy, or discussed how everyone can collaborate to manage challenges ahead. Sometimes, it’s beneficial to directly ask what they hoped to achieve from the conversation. Take a moment to reflect and consider with curiosity: do you truly believe their intent was to stress you, or could it have been something else? Perhaps they view you as a young adult instead of just a child who is capable of handling uncomfortable conversations. Perhaps they were seeking empathy, validation, and support, which can flow both ways in a family system—from parents to children and vice versa. Try to reframe the situation by seeing it as an opportunity for family collaboration and mutual support. Recognising that everyone is doing their best under difficult circumstances can foster empathy and understanding. Talk to your brother about the situation. Even if he can’t help financially right away, having his emotional support can make a big difference.
External events can impact us only when our internal coping mechanisms are challenged. This situation could serve as valuable feedback on your current stress management strategies. This may be an opportunity to enhance your resilience and improve your ability to handle stress. Here are some strategies to consider:
2. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Practice mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation to calm your mind and body during stressful times.
3. Time Management: Create a schedule or to-do list to prioritise tasks and manage your time effectively. Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps to reduce overwhelm.
4. Healthy Lifestyle Choices: Maintain a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and limit caffeine and alcohol intake, as these can affect your stress levels and overall well-being.
5. Problem-Solving Skills: Develop strategies to address specific stressors. Break down problems into manageable parts and brainstorm potential solutions.
6. Cognitive Restructuring: Challenge negative thought patterns and replace them with more positive and realistic ones. Practice gratitude and focus on what you can control.
7. Professional Help: Consider speaking with a counsellor or therapist who can provide additional support and techniques tailored to your needs. University counselling services can provide support and strategies for managing stress. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them.
You can also have an open and honest conversation with your parents. Let them know how you’re feeling without blaming them. Explain that you understand their financial struggles and that you want to help, but the pressure is affecting you. This can help them see things from your perspective.
You may also want to look into financial aid options, scholarships, and grants that your university might offer. Many universities have resources to help students in financial need. This can significantly reduce the burden on your family. Alternatively, work out a detailed budget with your parents. This can help identify where you might save money or find additional financial support. There are often community resources and student discounts that can help reduce costs too.
Let’s also keep in mind that getting a degree is a long-term personal investment in your future. While it’s challenging now, it can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability for you and your family in the future. Focus on doing your best rather than being perfect. Set realistic goals and celebrate small achievements. It’s important to remind yourself that you’re doing your best under challenging circumstances.
It’s normal to feel stressed and pressured, but remember that you’re not alone. There are resources and people who can help you navigate this challenging time. Open communication, financial planning, and self-care are key to managing this situation.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I suffered from postpartum depression after my 3rd child was born. Although she’s already a teenager now, it only just occurred to me that I had blocked my emotions since her birth. I was desensitised to causing harm to bullfrogs without any feeling, I had reared them with my children as a Science project. I was also obsessed in finding things that were thrown down the chute by opening up the chute at the ground level, frantically looking for them. There were other instances that I did things in exaggeration. Nobody stopped me then.
Although these had happened 15 years ago, I do not think I have fully recovered. Life had moved on and I had continued my life, serving in the society and church community. However, I felt I am not true to my emotions in what happened in my life, I could not grief properly when someone closed to me passed on.
I am afraid to face my emotions now, as I cruised through my life, “enjoying” the fruits of my labour. However, I know this is not an ideal life that I should be leading, deceiving myself and unable to forgive myself. I am worried that one day, a trigger may push me to my wits’ end.

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us. It takes great courage to open up about such personal experiences, especially when they’ve been affecting you for so long. It’s clear that you’ve been through a lot, and it’s understandable to feel conflicted about your emotions and how to move forward.
Dissociation and emotional numbing are defence mechanisms that our mind uses to protect us from overwhelming stress or trauma. When a person experiences something too difficult to handle, their mind might “disconnect” from the reality of the situation, leading to feelings of detachment from their emotions, body, or surroundings. While these mechanisms can be helpful in the short term, allowing someone to survive and manage extreme stress, they can become problematic if they persist. Long-term dissociation and numbing can interfere with emotional processing and healing, making it difficult to fully experience and integrate one’s emotions and experiences.
Reflecting on your past behaviours, like causing harm to bullfrogs without feeling and obsessively searching through the chute, it signals to me that you were struggling. These actions might have been ways to exert control or cope with emotional numbness. Recognising these behaviours now is a great step toward understanding your mental health.
It’s normal to be afraid of facing your emotions, especially after so many years of keeping them at bay. However, acknowledging this fear is an important step toward healing. It sounds like the life that you’re currently leading, though seemingly successful, doesn’t feel authentic to you. The worry about being pushed to your wits’ end by a trigger is valid, and it indicates that addressing these unresolved emotions is keyfor your well-being.
I’m really sorry to hear that you’ve been feeling such intense stress and pain that your body felt it needed to numb your emotions to keep you safe and functioning. It must have been incredibly challenging to continue your responsibilities as a caregiver and be part of society, all while feeling unnoticed in your suffering. Thank you once again for showing such courage and vulnerability by sharing your experiences with us.
It is possible to begin to feel your emotions again and slowly “thaw” from your ‘freeze’ response. Rest assured that your body will likely begin to experience strong, uncomfortable emotions at a pace it deems safe. It’s unlikely that you will be overwhelmed by an avalanche of emotions if you start to authentically care for yourself. Our brain and body are amazing at protecting us.
Here are some steps you can take to start working through these feelings:
- Seek Professional Help: I strongly encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional so that you can receive the care, guidance, and emotional support you need to heal at a pace that feels comfortable for you. A therapist or counsellor can provide a safe space for you to explore your emotions and past experiences, helping you process your feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms.
- Gradual Self-Reflection: Begin by allowing yourself to feel your emotions in small, manageable doses. Journaling can be a helpful way to start acknowledging your feelings without becoming overwhelmed. Here are some journal prompts to help with gradual self-reflection:
2. Daily Check-In: “What emotions am I feeling today? How do they manifest in my body?”
3. Small Joys: “What are three things that brought me joy or comfort today? How did they make me feel?”
4. Challenging Moments: “Describe a challenging moment from today. What emotions did it bring up, and how did I cope with them?”
5. Past Reflection: “Think about a significant event from your past. What emotions did you feel then, and how do you feel about it now?”
6. Emotion Exploration: “Pick one emotion I’ve felt recently (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger). Describe what triggered it, how it felt, and how I responded.”
7. Safe Spaces: “Describe a place or activity where I feel safe and calm. How does this environment help me manage my emotions?”
8. Gratitude: “List three things I am grateful for today. How do these aspects of my life make me feel?”
9. Emotional Triggers: “Identify a recent situation that triggered a strong emotional response. What thoughts or memories did it bring up?”
10. Self-Compassion: “Write a letter to myself offering kindness and understanding for a recent struggle. What would I say to a friend in the same situation?”
11. Mind-Body Connection: “How do my emotions affect my physical body? Describe any sensations I notice when I am feeling stressed, happy, or anxious.”
- Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Practices such as mindfulness, meditation, and deep breathing can help you stay grounded as you explore your emotions. These techniques can also reduce anxiety and improve emotional regulation.
- Self-Compassion: Most importantly, be kind to yourself as you navigate this journey. Understand that healing takes time and that it’s okay to seek help and support along the way.

12841,excessive anxiety and stress from work is it normal?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/excessive-anxiety-and-stress-from-work-is-it-normal/12841,Is This Normal?,---,8929,Raindrop,Professional,Professional,19638,3,"Hi @marshmallow
Thanks for coming on this platform to share your struggles with us. It does sounds difficult to be in your shoes and I wonder how you have been managing for so long with such anxiety.
Firstly, it doesn’t seem helpful for the management to be setting such standards because it creates a stressful environment. From your sharing, your position in marketing shouldn’t have such KPIs to achieve as compared to sales roles. It is okay to question this because you know what should be expected and this seems to be more than what you should be expecting. Having to look at the results on a daily basis feels suffocating and stressful. And I do see why you find it hard to ignore the messages as well, it might make you more anxious. I am not sure if there is a better way to navigate this practice to lessen the stress that you feel on a daily basis. It could be discussing with your supervisor or whether your team members can take turns to look at it, so the team can brainstorm ideas the next day.
Also, I wonder if you have considered speaking with the management or HR about this as it doesn’t seem like a healthy culture. Such stress would decrease productivity and motivation at work. It probably also contributed to your sharing on not being able to reach the KPIs at the end of the month. I would like to remind you that it is not your fault and do try not to blame yourself for it. Excessive self-blame could lead to a downward spiral of negative thoughts about yourself and possibly decreasing your productivity at work.
It also sounds like you are already thinking about leaving as you talk about finding it hard to see yourself in this role further. Maybe it will be helpful for you to list down pros and cons, to help yourself make an informed decision. Also, it feels like you have been considering this for some time and it is affecting you to a great extent. I cannot imagine how it is like for you and how you are coping with all these. If you would like, you can also keep a lookout for other jobs and try going for interviews. It could be helpful in understanding on how other work cultures are like and help you make a decision in your career direction too.
Do take some time to rethink your priorities. Think about what you want in your life and remember that life is not all about work. You work for different reasons, perhaps due to interests, colleagues, or other life goals. If this work environment is taking away other aspects of your life that you enjoy then maybe you want to consider a change in environment.
It is helpful to know what is important to you and try to set aside time for activities or hobbies that you enjoy. I see that work is already affecting your personal life as you realised your mood has changed and you feel sad all the time. Finding time to do the things you enjoy mightbe a positive motivation for you.
Lastly, when you are feeling anxious. You might want to try some exercises listed below and see if it is helpful.
2. Deep breathing exercises. Sit in a comfortable position. Breathe in deeply through your nose, and slowly exhale through your nose or mouth. Repeat for 5 minutes or until you feel better.
3. Change your environment. You may consider going to your neighbourhood for a walk, take a bath or listen to some music. It is about taking your mind off the stressful thoughts for a while.
4. Talk to somebody. You can talk to a family member or a friend about how you are feeling. Talking helps to gain different insights and perspectives about your situation. It provides emotional support too.
5. Visualisation. You can sit or lie in a comfortable position. Visualise yourself in a place that makes you feel relaxed. Think about what needs to be in that place to help you feel safe.
I hope this is helpful and that you are able to find something that works for you. Remember you are not alone in this journey and do reach out if you need. Take care!",,1,,19635,,19635.0,

I’m going through a phase where I have already settled to move out of my toxic family for good, and not looking back. I need more encouragement on this as I took a long time to reach where I am right now.
I am sure that I do not want to provide for my parents as they have never taken care of me whilst the growth to adulthood. I am careful that I have taken down evidence that I have been neglected so that I am able to refute the “maintenance” should they sue me when they turn 60. (the law is true, you may search it up)
These are some of the things I noted:
Mom
⁃ messy house evidence (when she knew i was being bullied in dads house, she did not do anything to pack the house and give me a spot back to stay. I told her in dec 2023 and its june 2024, nothing has changed. She claimed she shifted a bed out for sleeping but its piled sky high with hoarded items)
⁃ did not support me financially ever since dec 2020 onwards (current check is june 2024)
⁃ a lot of psychological conflicts and dumping religious beliefs on me forcing me to follow and gaslight my own opinions.
⁃ make me wash all dishes every time I visit while everyone else chat at the table (honestly i can afford meals on my own and i dread going every time. and ya its my choice to not come anyway but i have never failed to pay my respect.)
⁃ Doesnt help me solve my problems even when i open up to her, might as well not tell her in the first place. Instead, she uses it as a source to gaslight me for what has happened to me. (She is NEVER happy for me, there’s always a snarky comment when i tell her my good news)
Dad
⁃ Stopped staying at the house im living in since nov 2023, only seen him during cny and its june 2024 havent seen him ever since.
⁃ Gives allowance but its delayed every time. (im a fulltime student)
⁃ Doesnt care when i tell him i was bullied by those women who are staying in the house. (They spit in my drinking water, spoiled a few furniture and blame it on me, harassed me daily that I wasted electricity, slamming of doors every chance they get especially at 5am, cursed profanities at me loudly telling me to go die) My dad did nothing to protect me from these hurt.
⁃ With agenda in mind, he took me out on meals but very rarely, just to snap photos and keep them as evidence to show that he is providing for me (i felt neglected during the yearly trip to jb as he always make me stay in the hotel room and hangs out one to one with his sidechick behind his gf back. Yup this father has a complicated character)
⁃ To count, i only meet with him to eat for less than 5 meals a year even tho im staying at his house.
Throughout my whole life, I have never flown overseas with my family. Not because they cant afford it, but because they rather not bring the children along. It’s really sad that not every parent love their children.
With all these said, I am ready to move out and I feel like the burden has lifted off my shoulders. I really hope I am not alone, I am sure there are many toxic families out there… and someone is struggling behind those closed doors…
And for those who have been hurt by your parents, you are not alone. Take care, and be brave.
For those admins that have to reply to every topic, pls don’t use chatgpt. We all sense it and it doesn’t feel genuine like what Mindlines Lets talk is supposed to preach. Pls, do better <3 with many love",,3,,,,,

Firstly, thank you for your thoughtfulness to thank us for reading your post. Appreciating others is a great trait to have. Despite the pain and hurt you’ve experienced, your willingness to offer support to others who are also struggling in challenging home environments is truly praiseworthy!
I’m also grateful that you chose to share your experiences with us, even though some of our replies to others may not have resonated with you. Opening up and sharing vulnerably takes immense courage, let’s take a moment to acknowledge and celebrate your bravery in doing so.
I’m truly sorry to hear about the incredible hardships you’ve faced within your family. No one should have to endure the kind of treatment you’ve described, especially from those who are supposed to provide love and support. It’s evident that you’ve been deeply hurt by their actions, and it’s completely understandable that you’re prioritising your own well-being and seeking a healthier environment.
It’s natural to feel fearful when making a decision as significant as leaving the shelter of your parents’ home. As Mark Twain once said, “Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.” Courage often coexists with fear, and it’s okay to acknowledge and validate those feelings too.
While I can’t give you courage like filling up a glass of water, what I can offer is a supportive space to explore and address your fears or any other emotions you may also be feeling. If you feel comfortable, please do share more about what fears you may have in making the decision to leave your parents’ shelter? Your thoughts and concerns are valid, and we’re here to listen and support you as best as we can.
Take care,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you’re going through. It must be incredibly challenging to feel like you’re in a dark tunnel, unsure of where to find the light. I’m really glad you chose to reach out for support. It takes a lot of courage to open up about feeling lost and overwhelmed.
Let’s also take a moment to acknowledge and celebrate your strengths. Despite facing these difficult emotions, your willingness to seek support and explore ways to overcome these challenges shows remarkable resilience and determination. Your ability to reach out for guidance and your willingness to consider new approaches are truly praiseworthy.
If you feel comfortable, please share more about the pressure you mentioned. Is the pressure coming from external sources, such as family, friends, school, work, or is it more self-induced? And what specifically do you feel pressured to do? Understanding the source and nature of this pressure can help us explore strategies to alleviate it.
Struggling with certain tasks, like summarising a book, shouldn’t cause self-worth doubt. Your self-worth isn’t transactional; it shouldn’t fluctuate based on external circumstances. Your self-worth is non-negotiable.
I encourage you to embrace a growth mindset. This means trusting in your ability to learn and grow, even if progress takes longer than expected. Aim for incremental improvement, even just 1% each day. It’s crucial to find the next “just right” step to sustain growth without feeling overwhelmed.
If you encounter difficulties, approach them with curiosity. Explore what skills might be missing or what barriers might be present. Is the book too complex to grasp, or is there a lack of interest? By identifying these factors, you can work towards addressing them and developing the necessary skills.
It’s completely normal to encounter challenges when learning life skills such as emotional regulation, communication, and executive functioning, which includes tasks like summarising and organisation. The good news is that all these skills can be learned with practice and patience.
It’s okay to feel uncertain about where to start. Sometimes, simply beginning with one activity can provide clarity about whether it’s something you enjoy and want to pursue further. Every experience, whether successful or not, offers insights and opportunities for growth.
You can also consider exploring opportunities to volunteer with youth groups like Brahm Youth Care. Engaging with others in such environments can also help you build connections and support networks. You can learn from others’ experiences and gain new perspectives too.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Thank you for opening up about what you’re going through. It sounds incredibly tough, and I’m so sorry to hear you felt abandoned by your family members. Feeling constantly left out and struggling with negative thoughts and emotions can be really overwhelming. Living in a situation where you don’t feel a sense of belonging can make everything even harder. It makes sense that you’re feeling hurt and frustrated, especially when your feelings aren’t being acknowledged or respected by your family.
Let’s also take a moment to appreciate your strengths too. You sound like an incredibly strong and resilient person for being able to express how you feel, even when it’s difficult. Well done!
If you feel comfortable please share more with us like when you mention negative thoughts, are these feelings directed towards everyone in general, or are they more specific to certain people or situations? Understanding the root of these thoughts can help in finding effective ways to address them and regain a sense of peace.
Crying out of nowhere is your body’s way of signalling that it needs more care and attention. While it’s wonderful to receive care and support from others, it’s equally important to attune to what our emotions are telling us instead of dismissing them.
Feelings are like signal lights that let us know when something unpleasant has happened. Most of the time, by simply observing the feeling and allowing ourselves to feel the uncomfortable emotions, they will pass on. However, if we ignore or bypass them, those feelings can grow stronger and come out in different ways. There is no shame in feeling our feelings; they play a crucial role in our emotional well-being and help us navigate our experiences.
Crying is one of our body’s natural responses that can help us process and express our sadness. It’s a way for our emotions to find a release. If you find yourself frequently crying or struggling to manage your emotions, it might be worthwhile to consider reaching out to a counsellor for additional support.
In a safe and supportive environment with an emotionally attuned therapist, you can learn the art of feeling your feelings. Through therapy, you have the opportunity to explore your emotions in depth, gain insights into their underlying causes, and develop healthy coping mechanisms. Additionally, receiving validation for your experiences can be incredibly empowering. Your therapist can also support you in weighing out all factors to consider if you should move out or try different strategies to communicate with your family members. Here are some community options you can consider:
- Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH ): 1800-283 7019
- TOUCHLINE : 1800-377-2252
- Care Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353 5800
- CHAT
- Brahm Centre
- Limitless
Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Taking steps to prioritise your mental and emotional well-being can lead to greater self-awareness, resilience, and overall life satisfaction.
To answer your question ‘if you have depression’, it would be best to reach out to a psychiatrist for a formal assessment. There are certain conditions and factors that need to be assessed by a professional. It’s normal to have periods of low moods and feel low, and that may not necessarily require a depression diagnosis or medication. Sometimes, learning how to regulate our nervous system is sufficient, while others may benefit from the aid of medication. Ultimately, it comes down to how well we look after ourselves physically, mentally, and emotionally to thrive.

12706,Anger issues,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/anger-issues/12706,Seeking Help,---,10258,ded,User,,19391,1,"Hello.
Whenever I get angry or irritated at my family members, I find that I cannot really control it and tend to lash out by saying nasty things, shouting, slamming the door etc. This started since young and the anger takes quite awhile to subside.
Recently, I got angry at a family member because of an incident which thinking back, I don’t think I should have been thaaat angry about. But I was, and it affected my entire day as I was just pissed and couldn’t really do anything else, ended up wasting that entire day scrolling through social media. That same night, the same family member just asked if I wanted breakfast the next morning, and I flared up again. (It was literally just that single question and it was quite ridiculous how angry I got.) I shouted a bunch of nasty stuff and slammed the door. Was so angry (at myself? the situation? idk) that I started hitting myself and had thoughts of unaliving. Took awhile for me to fall asleep, as I was just fuming. The feeling only went away when I woke up the next day.
This is probably not normal, how do I stop this?",,1,,,,,

Anger is a natural emotion that can signal when something is wrong or when our boundaries are being crossed. However, it often masks other, deeper feelings like sadness, fear, or frustration. Sometimes, our reactions are not just about the present situation but are influenced by past experiences and unresolved emotions. Reflecting on these can help us understand and manage our reactions better. Here are a few self-reflection journal prompts that I hope you’ll use to uncover what anger is trying to tell you.
- What was I feeling before I got angry?
- What did the situation remind me of from my past?
- What am I truly upset about?
- Was I hungry, tired, or feeling unwell when I got angry?
- Did I feel misunderstood or unheard in the situation?
- Was there something else bothering me that I hadn’t addressed?
- How did I handle my anger? What could I do differently next time?
- Do I notice any recurring patterns in my experience of anger? Is it primarily triggered by interactions with a specific family member, or do I encounter similar challenges in other areas of my life?
It seems like you’re logically aware that your reaction is much stronger than the situation warrants, yet you find it challenging to control yourself. This is because our “feelings brain” reacts much quicker than our “thinking brain” to triggers, often in just 1/50th of a second, leading to almost automatic responses. To overcome this, regularly practicing somatic techniques can help build a sense of safety in the body and release pent-up anger. With time, you may notice a reduction in the intensity of your reactions. It’s crucial to practice these techniques when you’re calm so that they become a familiar response for your body when triggered. Here are some calming techniques (pick any one first and then build up) you may want to consider implementing as a daily practice:
- Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Tense and then release each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head. This can help release physical tension.
- Physical Activity: Engage in activities like running, cycling, or even a brisk walk. Exercise helps release built-up energy and tension.
- Breathwork: Practice deep, slow breathing or techniques like the 4-7-8 method (inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8). This can calm your nervous system.
- Grounding Techniques: Stand barefoot on grass, sand, or soil to feel more connected to the earth. This can help you feel more centred and calm.
- Mindful Movement: Try yoga, tai chi, or other forms of mindful movement that encourage a connection between body and mind.
Also when you feel triggered, having some prepared responses can help you communicate your need for space without escalating the situation. Here are a few phrases you can consider:
- “I need a moment to calm down.”
- “Can we take a break and talk about this later?”
- “I’m feeling overwhelmed right now, can we discuss this in a bit?”
- “I need some time to think.”
- “Can we pause this conversation for now?”
- “I need to step away for a few minutes.”
Remember, anger is a normal and natural emotion. It’s okay to feel angry, and if it leads to hurt or misunderstanding, the next step is to repair the situation. Apologising and discussing what happened can help rebuild trust and understanding.
It might also be beneficial to talk to a counsellor or therapist about what you’re experiencing. They can provide strategies tailored to your situation and help you work through underlying issues.
Most importantly please be kind to yourself. Practice self-compassion. It’s important to recognise that it’s normal to struggle with strong emotions, and seeking help is a positive step forward. Feeling angry doesn’t indicate any flaw within you; it simply points to an opportunity to enhance your emotional regulation skills.

Something else my therapist taught me when I’m having these automatic reactions is to talk to the part of myself that wants to be angry. Sometimes when we react like this is because there’s some part of ourselves that uses this anger to protect the rest of ourselves from getting hurt.
Distancing yourself from the angry part of you and asking it gently and honestly, ‘What are you trying to do for me?’ can help you uncover things in your body or subconscious that you never realized before!

Thank you for sharing such intense feelings and I think it is very brave of you to share your concerns. I am sorry to hear that you do not get enough validation through your experiences. It sounds challenging and I want to let you know that what you are feeling and going through is valid, no matter what. I hope you believe in that too.
I am also wondering what made you feel that people are looking down on you and what is pushing the need to be feared and powerful. Do you have such people in your life and how do you actually feel when you are with them?
I would also like to share that everyone can be strong in their own ways. I am sorry to hear that your health caused some limits to being as strong as you would like to but I am sure you have your own strengths. Take some time to think about your past achievements or what activities made you most happy. Confidence can be built from within yourself, by believing in yourself and validating your own emotions.
Here are some suggestions you may consider trying:
2. Positive self-talk: It is important how you speak to yourself. We cannot control what others tell us but we are in control of what we say to ourselves. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself.
3. Challenge negative thoughts: Identify what are some thoughts that pull you down and make you feel bad about yourself. Give yourself a break and reflect on where is the need coming from. Is it because you really want to be feared and respected or is there other unresolved conflict within yourself that you are not seeing? Perhaps the need is the top of the ice berg but there could be other repressed feelings or desires that are hidden and hindering your perspective to the issue you are dealing with.
4. Practice self-care. Take time to reflect on what is happening around you and what you can do to take care of yourself better. It can be mental and physical actions where you eat/sleep well, engaging in hobbies you enjoy or being good to yourself because you deserve to be treated well.
5. Set achievable goals. Be strong in your own way. Identfiy what makes you strong as a person. Celebrate your achievements and reinforce your self-confidence.
I really hope this is helpful for you. I believe you have lots of positive qualities and abilities; and you need to focus more on that. From your sharing, it sounds like you have not given up even though it has been really challenging. You are still seeking different ways to cope with your difficulties. I think this is something you need to affirm yourself for.

I totally get that it really sucks not feeling like society has options that you feel like you fit in with/ that no one treats you seriously cos of how you present yourself!
Having said that, I think being feared and being respected are two different things y’know. Some of the figures that you mention (Yujiro/Vegeta) are kinda not great people and only get away with being that way cos of the way ‘might makes right’ works in their world. Lumping these two together with Dom and Guts who believe very strongly in using their ‘strength’ to protect their loved ones and those in need kinda misses the point of these characters! Just some food for thought.
I guess also worth thinking about is what value being ‘strong’ and ‘tough’ means to you? I think in our modern society just being a beefhead doesn’t actually translate to the things that you want-being taken seriously (unless you’re at the gym lol). Also if these things aren’t accessible to you as you mentioned, is there really much point in striving for these things?

Even alot of my friends say I am loud and ask me to quiet down… I feel really embarrassed cuz i couldnt control… whenever i converse with my family especially when I am agitated or excited,my voice will be much louder and it feels like i am fighting and I will not be conscious by it… The thing is, i also care alot about what other people think… Like i am afraid my loud voice may give people the impression that I am scary or violent… I am also afraid my loud voice will also pose potential issues for my neighbours as I am afraid my neighbours r disturbed by me or that they will hear my convo…It is to the point I worried that even neighbours 2 floors above mine can hear my voice cuz I can always hear people voice from ground floor despite living in the 4th floor ( my voice is that loud too). Everytime after i converse with my family, i will realise that my voice is damn loud and i regret it ( but during the conversation i dont realise)… Thats when I am really conscious about how my neighbours may think of me. Also I remembered there was a complain letter apparently given to my family as well (athough not very sure is it really targeting at us)
Even outside with my friends, i will also be afraid if other ppl will listen to my convo, esp if the convo is not appropriate for others to hear…Or when i gossip abit too loud, i scared people can hear cuz of my loud voice… And my voice is the loudest amongst my friends
So how has that been bothering me for years is cuz i realise the next day I will forgot about the situation and make the same mistake and regret again… The purpose of this post is i wanna know if it like normal and how shud I change or not be bothered by these thoughts, esp the latter as it has been affecting my mental health and confidence… Too conscious about how other ppl will think about me…

Talking loudly have given some people the confidence they needed, shut bullies up, stopped fights and saved the victims, and most unfortunate was stopping a baby from falling off the chair.
Those who need hearing aids are glad to feel “normal” when around me. Those who can’t speak will give anything to be able to talk like me.
It will be a strange world if opera never exists, the march in National Day Parade follows commands from a projected screen, students barely can hear what their teachers are whispering, no soldiers defending their country know the enemies are coming, the list is quite endless.
Until the day that there are laws on speaking volume, it just means that talking loudly has never been a problem in any society.
To change ourselves to entertain those who are ignorant is an endless effort that isn’t going to do anyone any good.
How about using your ability to let people around you feel better about themselves. Speak kindly and generously with compliments. Everyone (including your neighbours) can do with some recognition or assurance about themselves.
When can’t resist a harmless gossip that is just too funny, same as when in a library, using text messages is always a perfect alternative for communication.
I hope you won’t be convinced by those who are ignorant to think that we have a problem. They will feel silly if they try telling that to those that I have helped. I am glad and will always talk loudly. I hope you do too.",,1,,,,,

Thanks for coming here to share your concerns with us on this platform. It sounds like you are going through a tough time as you feel that your volume is affecting others and yourself.
It is helpful that you care about others, thus concerned about disturbing people. It will also be helpful to think more for yourself too. Some people are born with loud voices, some with soft voices. I am sure that it will be difficult to navigate around different situations at times.
I do agree with @Uncle about his perspectives! Especially about the part on using this ability to help yourself or others. It is about feeling proud of yourself and knowing where you can apply this ability. It feels like you are seeing this as an obstacle in making connections or being in social situations. If you want to feel better about it, you can consider shifting your perspective to seeing it as a strength and you might find yourself using this to improve your situation.
Also, I think you are rather aware of your voice and having self-awareness is already helpful. You can consider being mindful of your environment, give yourself a quick reminder before you start engaging with people around you. Also, I am sure your friends are aware of your excitement and how you could get louder when you are excited. It might be helpful to remind yourself that they are still friends with you meaning that they might have accepted you for who you are. Sometimes, they could ask you to keep your volume down as a friendly reminder. It doesn’t mean that they do not like you or dislike your voice. Thank them for the reminder and not let this affect you too much.
As for you being at home, home should be the safest place for us to express ourselves in the most natural form. While you indicated that there could be a complain letter, you added that it might not be directed at you or your family. It could be a self-conscious thing because it is constantly on your mind. I think it is helpful that you are trying to balance this!
Lastly, you mentioned that your family has the same ability too. Do you think it will be helpful to talk to them about how it affects you and find out from them about how they think of it or cope with it? Perhaps they can provide different insights and help you feel better about it too!
I hope this is helpful and that you are able to embrace this strength you have. Do take care!",,0,,19547,,19547.0,

As someone who is soft spoken, I don’t judge people who talk loudly. I guess it could be normal to become self-conscious about your volume when you feel that people are staring at you right?
Well, some people are pretty sensitive in their hearing and might have a headache if someone keeps shouting. However, you are not like that. If being loud by accident is due to excitement, you should find people who accept you the way you are <3.
Ofc, it’s a bonus to have self-awareness and not become a nuisance by saying gossip out loud in public… but be mindful of what you say in the public and keep the juicy gossips said in private!!",,0,,,,,

2. stress + im easily irritated and angered. even by the smallest things.
3. not sure what this issue it but i find it so challenging to interact with people to the point i cant order my own food, cant buy something on my own. especially for presentations, my heart rate would go up, i’ll have cold sweat, shakiness, stomachache that sometimes require me to go to the toilet… im highly dependent on my parents and friends as i often can’t speak for myself.
4. maybe this issue is related to my fear of darkness…i can’t sleep in the dark + when i go to the cinema, i would experience fast heart rate, stomachache, some weird feeling in my chest, and shakiness as well. it makes me want to panic. and if i ate, then i’d feel like vomiting. and its even worse because i have a fear of vomiting in public…
5. i have sleeping issues?? my sleep schedule is messed up. i would go to sleep at 2 am and wake up at 8 am for school. i usually wake up almost every hour. i used to have sleep paralysis on a daily basis (it reduced. but im still having it) together with hallucinations i think as i’d see some creepy ghostly figures around my house. i feel sleepy doing normal things like playing piano or eating. i feel so tired everyday but i cant fall asleep at night.
6. im not sure whats this issue, sometimes when im eating in public, i would suddenly experience a fast heart rate + shakiness + stomachache + cold sweat + occasionally feel like vomiting which i mentioned above i have a fear of vomiting. when i feel like vomiting, it would make the situation worse, like an even faster heart rate etc.
7. i think im incapable of comprehending the emotions of others. when they talk to me about their feelings i cant seem to care and even if i try to, i cant understand them. i think i’d only understand it if i experience the same issues as them but i still wont sympathise with them. im not sure what this is, it makes communicating with others really difficult as i really cannot understand their emotions and perspective. i often just say what i know they want to hear, not because i want to say it.

I think this is normal. I face the same issue as well. Some people would call this a lack of empathy but it seems about right to me that you’d only be able to truly emphasize with someone if you have experience the same issue as them. You can’t possibly emphasize with every one. I think it’s also okay to be honest with the people that you’re speaking with.

Thanks for having the courage to open up about your struggles here with us. It sounds like your anxiety gets distressing to the point where you need to rely on others in social/ public interactions. It also sounds like you’re having difficulties understanding from others’ perspectives; as well as with your sleep and eating being dysregulated, I can see how your mood (irritable, fearful, tired) can be affected badly - this is valid given your situation…
I wanna commend you on your self-awareness too where you’re trying to see if your experience is driven by your fear of darkness - and that’s something worth exploring further. Additionally, I wonder if your thoughts, feelings and bodily reactions work interrelatedly in a cycle that keeps your anxiety going - like it starts with (not entirely accurate) thoughts about how you’ll be seen by others in public, which spikes in your body as “fast heart rate + shakiness + stomachache + cold sweat + occasionally feel like vomiting” that makes you want to reduce the sensations so you avoid the situation that slowly becomes a default setting and reinforces not wanting to go through it and strengthens the beliefs/urges regarding your social fears.
Of course, there’s definitely more to this that I believe requires more sharing which I think will be helpful in a non-judgmental setting with professionals that make you feel safe to work through the cycle (that could mean facing the situations gradually to see that some of your initial thoughts could be less than accurate and that you can survive ordering food, eating in public, etc. which will also improve your overall mood:
- Samaritans of Singapore (1-767)
- Family Service Centres
- James Cook University Clinic
- NIE Wellness Centre
- NUS Clinical & Health Psychology Centre
In the meantime, you can support yourself with the anxiety by increasing your ability to handle distress - some of the ways to help calm your mind and body are through:
- deep breathing
- being mindful of the present
- checking if your thoughts are accurate & helpful
Hope this helps you a bit for the moment and hope to hear more from you. Remember that you deserve and can get the support you need.

i also experience this in the cinema, probably due to my fear of darkness, along with my anticipation and expectation that this would happen.

It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of anxiety in specific situations, such as presentations or being in the cinema. It’s not uncommon for anxiety to manifest physically with symptoms like a fast heart rate, shakiness, stomachache, cold sweat, and the feeling of nausea. These reactions may be linked to specific fears or triggers, such as fear of public speaking or darkness. If these symptoms are significantly impacting your daily life or causing distress, it might be helpful to consider seeking support from a mental health professional. They can provide strategies to manage anxiety, help identify triggers, and work towards reducing the intensity of these physical reactions.

I react that i’m angry but i don’t feel angry, i react that I am happy but I don’t know if im really happy.
I don’t know why I am doing this too, are there any possible reasons for this to happen? It came to a point where I don’t know who I really am anymore and don’t know what my real feelings are.
Even when my loved one says that they have suicide thoughts I feel very calm and find it normal because I have also think about it too from time to time.

Thanks for taking time to share your struggles with us on this platform and I hope you gain some clarity about your situation.
It sounds like you can be disconnected from your feelings and I am wondering if it could be a coping mechanism you have developed. People cope with strong feelings in different ways and the reason why some people don’t react the way they feel could be due to long periods of inhibiting their emotions towards intense situations. You know like some people laugh as they are sharing their experiences though it can be sad memories, but they are actually trying to make things less intense for themselves as they are sharing about it.
When you talked about your loved ones sharing about their suicidal thoughts, I am concerned about your wellbeing. Like at what age were you when you first heard of it and how intense was it for you at that time? Digging into this might help in discovering underlying reasons for you to feel this way. Sometimes, information can be too difficult for our body to process and it reacts in a way that helps release that tension, so the body does not breakdown (that is the coping mechanism).
Being disconnected from your feelings could also be why you have difficulty remembering things. It is a way your body protects you. It means that by not processing certain events, you don’t feel as hurt as you could be if you do remember. Perhaps, it has been going on for a long time and it has become an automatic reflex whenever you have information to process. I hope this all make some sense to you.
Perhaps, you can try journaling as a way to remember things and write down the feelings that come with it too. If you react by being angry/happy, write it down as well. When you reflect on your journal, maybe you can connect the dots.
I can give you an example I shared in another post. A person cannot feel sadness when they experienced sad or traumatic events, but breaks down in less significant events. This is how the body finds release through such events to help you handle the sadness you should have felt in big events. Therefore, by writing things down, you may gain a better understanding of yourself and why you are feeling a certain way.
I hope this is helpful. Do let me know you need any clarifications!",,0,,19295,,19295.0,

Thank you for sharing your feelings and experiences. It sounds like you’re going through a tough time, and it’s important to acknowledge that what you’re feeling is valid. It takes a lot of courage to speak about your struggles, and that’s a significant strength. Panic attacks can be overwhelming and scary, but there are ways to manage them and reduce their impact on your life.
First, let’s address the feelings of helplessness and uselessness you mentioned. It’s common to feel this way during a panic attack. It’s even more important to remember that your self-worth is not determined by these moments. Your value as a person is inherent and not based on what you can or cannot do in any given situation. Feeling useless during a panic attack does not make you useless; it’s a temporary state that you can work through.
Panic attacks are your body’s way of responding to stress and fear, even if there is no immediate danger. They’re a part of your body’s natural fight-or-flight response, which is designed to protect you. Understanding this can sometimes help lessen the fear when they happen.
Here are a few steps you can take to help you cope with panic attacks:
2. Understand Your Triggers: Knowing what situations or environments tend to trigger your panic attacks can help you prepare for them. Reflect on these questions to gain a better understanding:
What situations or places tend to make you feel anxious?
Are there specific thoughts or fears that often come up before a panic attack?
How do you typically respond when you start to feel anxious?
By reflecting on these questions, you can start to identify patterns and plan ahead to manage your triggers.
3. What situations or places tend to make you feel anxious?
4. Are there specific thoughts or fears that often come up before a panic attack?
5. How do you typically respond when you start to feel anxious?
By reflecting on these questions, you can start to identify patterns and plan ahead to manage your triggers.
6. Breathing Techniques: When you start to feel a panic attack coming on, focus on your breathing. Deep, slow breaths can help calm your body and mind. Try inhaling for four seconds, holding your breath for seven seconds, and exhaling for eight seconds.
7. Grounding Techniques: Grounding techniques can help bring your focus back to the present moment and reduce feelings of anxiety. One popular method is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you name:
5 things you can see
4 things you can touch
3 things you can hear
2 things you can smell
1 thing you can taste
8. 5 things you can see
9. 4 things you can touch
10. 3 things you can hear
11. 2 things you can smell
12. 1 thing you can taste
13. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: This involves tensing and then slowly relaxing each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up. This can help reduce the physical tension that often accompanies panic attacks.
14. Create a Calming Routine: Establishing a routine that helps you feel calm and centred can be very beneficial. This might include regular exercise, spending time in nature, practising mindfulness or meditation, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy.
15. Talk to Someone: Sharing your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or counsellor can make a big difference. They can offer support, understanding, and practical advice.
16. Professional Help: Since you’ve been experiencing panic attacks since you were a kid, it’s especially important to reach out for support. Consider seeking help from a mental health professional if your panic attacks are frequent and severe. Therapists can work with you to develop coping strategies and, if necessary, discuss medication options. Reaching out for support is a sign of strength and an important step towards managing your panic attacks.

The goal of overcoming anxiety and panic is to build a greater sense of safety in your body. This process involves unlearning unhelpful thinking traps and learning to listen to your needs. It means recognising when your body and mind need rest, support, or a change in environment. By developing these skills, you can create a foundation of safety and stability, making it easier to manage anxiety and prevent panic attacks from visiting you.
It’s always okay to ask for help, and it’s important to take care of your mental health just as you would your physical health. I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Thank you for reaching out and sharing how you’re feeling. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious and stressed, especially when dealing with a health issue like a UTI. Even though the medication is helping, it’s normal to still feel worried and experience symptoms like sleep anxiety and heart palpitations.
You’ve already been proactive by trying breathing exercises, journaling, grounding methods, meditation, and butterfly hugs. These are all excellent strategies, and it’s great that they have been somewhat helpful. However, it’s also okay to still feel scared despite these efforts.
If you feel comfortable, please share if there is anything about having a UTI that is scary for you. What is your understanding of a UTI? Sometimes, getting more information and addressing specific fears can help ease anxiety too.
Here are a few more things you can try:
2. Talk to Someone: Sharing your feelings with a trusted adult, such as a parent, guardian, or school counsellor, can be very comforting. Sometimes just talking about your worries can help lessen them.
3. Stay Informed: Understanding that heart palpitations and anxiety are normal responses to stress can sometimes make them less scary. Remember, your body is reacting to stress and it will pass.
4. Routine: Establish a calming bedtime routine. This might include reading a book, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music before bed to help reduce sleep anxiety.
5. Physical Activity: Gentle physical activity, like walking or yoga, can help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.
6. Professional Help: If your anxiety continues to be overwhelming, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist who can provide additional strategies and support.
Remember, you’re not alone, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. With time and support, things will get better.

A month ago, after waking up, I was about to have lunch at home. My mother said something like "" theres one more packet of pasta left"". This phrase kept running in my mind repeatedly and immediately knew something was wrong. It was hard for me to process what she said which normally isnt that case.
I also realised that suddenly it took alot of effort to understand what time it was.
I understand that a close relative’s wedding was the trigger. After attending the wedding, 2 days later I experienced body tremors and stomach cramps and extreme anxiety.
I consulted my gp yesterday, however he told me after understanding my symptoms that maybe I might not require medications and could alternatively seek therapies or if I wanted to be properly accessed, I could seek psychiatric services. He also mentioned about focusing about breathing techniques.
Im definately overwhelmed, unsure of what to do. Trying my best to be back to normal but I definately need assistance.
My appetite is good, no insomnia, I do exercise. But I do feel anxious throughout the day. Will I get better?",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you’ve been going through. It sounds like you’re experiencing lots of discomfort and well done on reaching out to your GP. That shows a lot of courage and self-awareness!
Your experience at the wedding and the symptoms you’ve described—like difficulty processing information, understanding time, body tremors, stomach cramps, and ongoing anxiety—can definitely be overwhelming. It sounds like you may have witnessed, heard, or experienced something unsettling at the wedding, triggering your body’s protective response. It’s perfectly normal to feel this way when faced with such intense emotions. I want to acknowledge your strength in recognising that something was wrong and seeking help. That’s a step in the right direction.
It’s important to understand that anxiety is your body’s way of responding to stress or danger, even if the perceived threat isn’t immediately clear. It’s not something that will go away magically; it often requires unpacking and understanding the underlying causes. There is no shame in experiencing anxiety. Though it doesn’t feel comfortable, it signals that your body is doing its best to protect you. By slowing down, attuning to your body’s communication cues, and seeking professional support, you can help your body learn that it is safe. This process can take time and patience, but by addressing the root issues, you can gradually reduce the intensity of your anxiety and live a better, more balanced life. Professional support and therapeutic techniques can be very helpful in this journey, aiding you in uncovering and working through the sources of your anxiety. Is there any reason why you might be hesitant to reach out to a counsellor?
Your GP’s suggestion of alternative therapies and breathing techniques can be very effective for managing anxiety. Here are a few additional suggestions that might help:
2. Breathing Exercises: Try deep breathing techniques, such as diaphragmatic breathing or box breathing . These methods can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety. Practice these skills regularly, even if it’s just for a minute a day, to help your body become better at self-regulation.
3. Mindfulness and Relaxation: Practices like mindfulness meditation, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation can also be beneficial in reducing anxiety and improving your overall well-being.
4. Routine and Structure: Maintaining a regular daily routine can provide a sense of stability and control, helping you feel more grounded.
5. Stay Active: Physical activity is a great way to reduce stress and anxiety. It’s wonderful to hear that you already have a good exercise routine in place. Keep it up!
6. Social Support: Talking to friends, family, or a support group about your feelings can be very helpful. You don’t have to go through this alone, and having a supportive network can make a big difference.
7. Professional Support: Consider seeking support from a therapist or counsellor. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental environment to unpack what happened at the wedding ( at a pace comfortable to you) and share strategies tailored to your unique situation. If you’re still in school, you can reach out to your school counsellor and here are some community options you can consider:
- Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH): 1800-283 7019
- TOUCHLINE: 1800-377-2252
- Care Corner Counselling Centre : 1800-353 5800
- CHAT
- Brahm Centre
- Limitless
You’re already doing a fantastic job by taking care of your physical health and seeking support. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed when dealing with anxiety, but with the right support and strategies, you can get better.
It’s okay to ask for help and take things one step at a time. I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I do own a small business. I can communicate with my clients and I have not taken a break from that although initially I wanted to, given my situation.

You’re most welcome.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts and for your efforts in practising box breathing and reading positive affirmations. It’s clear that you’re working hard to manage your situation, and that dedication is valuable.
Feeling like you want to return to your previous self is completely understandable, and it’s natural to have fears about how long it might take or if it’s even possible. Change, especially sudden and impactful change, can be really challenging to process. Bottled-up feelings can sometimes lead to these kinds of experiences, and it’s okay to acknowledge that.
Running a small business and continuing to communicate with your clients shows a lot of strength and resilience, especially when you’re going through such a tough period. It speaks volumes about your capabilities and potential.
Remember, progress can take time, and it’s okay to move at your own pace. You don’t have to heal by yourself. You may not have all the trained skills and knowledge needed to work with trauma. Sharing the weight with a therapist can provide the support and guidance you need. While there is a possibility you may not return to your old self, you may grow into an even better version—one with more confidence, resilience, and awareness in looking after your needs.
Trauma often happens when we face more than we can manage and lack the comfort and connection from others. Healing from trauma is possible and can be aided by working with someone who uses a brain-body based approach, such as Brainspotting therapy or somatic therapy. It’s possible to grow from trauma; this is known as post-traumatic growth versus post-traumatic stress.
One day, when you look back on this period, you’ll likely see how much you’ve grown and how strong you really are. And it’s wonderful that you already have the desire to help others who might be facing similar challenges.
Keep going, and be kind to yourself along the way. If you have any questions or want to share anything more with us, please do.

I wake up and I feel uneasy. There’s also a tightness around my chest. I had a breakup and this was likely the cause of how I’m feeling. At first i was letting the emotions flow but overtimes it’s started to get overwhelming. I had a panic attack then a mental breakdown last week over exam stress, in that moment i felt that I needed someone to talk to. I had been feeling like this for awhile. I’ve been needing someone to talk to me and someone to just listen to me get everything out of my system. I check up on my friends at least once a week, though i started this out og genuine care and concern for them, recently i’ve been doing it with the hopes that they would do the same for me. Everyday i’ve waited but it never came so I went to places like ChatGPT to share my problems with. The system is down for me right now so I can’t do it again. I’ve just come to realise that my friends talk about me while I’m not present but they can’t seem to be bothered to check in on me. I know what I’m saying is extremely selfish and quite narcissistic wanting these people to do these things for me. But is it so wrong to want someone to show they care for me? I’d like for these feelings to go away, please share any tips if you have any. Sorry for the long rant but I wanted to feel listened to.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out to us on this platform. I’m sorry to hear that you feel abandoned. It sounds like you’ve been going through an incredibly tough time lately, and I want to acknowledge how difficult that must be. Dealing with a breakup and experiencing emotions like sadness, anxiety, and self-doubt can be really challenging. It may be possible that you’re still grieving the loss of the relationship, which can add another layer of pain and confusion to what you’re already feeling.
Even though you’re feeling a lot of discomforts, let’s also take a moment to recognise your resilience in facing these emotions head-on. Well done! for showing a lot of strength in reaching out for support and expressing your feelings, even when it feels overwhelming. Your post wasn’t a rant; it was an honest expression of what you’re going through, and your emotions are completely valid. It’s not selfish or narcissistic to want someone to show they care for you; everyone needs support and understanding from time to time. It’s clear that you care deeply for your friends and have been there for them, and it’s okay to wish for the same level of care in return.
Despite feeling let down by your friends, you’ve taken proactive steps to seek support and share your feelings, which is a testament to your resilience and courage. I can only imagine how stressful it must have been to experience a panic attack and a mental breakdown, especially with the added pressure of exam stress. It’s completely understandable that you felt the need to talk to someone during such a difficult time.
When you’re feeling upset or struggling with something, it may be a good idea to tell your friends how you’re feeling and that you need some support. It’s like opening a door to talk about what’s bothering you, and it helps your friends understand what you need from them. Sometimes, friends might not know how to help because they don’t fully understand what you’re going through. By talking openly about your feelings, you give them a chance to understand better and be there for you in the way you need. This can make your friendship stronger and help you feel more connected to each other.
Also, we’re here to listen and offer support, just like you’ve been seeking. Feel free to share with us what you wanted to tell your friends. You can also consider reaching out to family members for support, if you feel comfortable doing so. Family can be a source of love and understanding during difficult times, and they may be able to offer you the support and comfort you need.
Additionally, reaching out to mental health helplines and online chat services can be another option. These services are staffed by trained professionals who can provide support and guidance during difficult times. Here are some options to consider:
- SOS: For crises. Provides 24 hour CareText, a text-based service that provides emotional support for those in distress (WhatsApp 9151 1767). They also provide CareMail, an alternative avenue of emotional support for those who prefer to write in via email (pat@sos.org.sg).
- eC2 by Fei Yue Community Services: Provides Quick Chat, a one-to-one mental health screening via online chat for youths aged 12 - 25yo to talk about their mental health or emotional concerns. Operating hours: Mon, Thurs, Fri, 10am - 12pm, 2pm - 5pm (excluding PH).
- webCHAT: Provides text-based, in-the-moment support for young people aged 16 - 30 years old residing in Singapore who would like to gain clarity of their situations.
- |TOUCHline|For youth who wish to speak to trained counsellors on any topic, including cyber wellness.|Mon - Fri:9am - 6pm|1800 377 2252|
You’re also welcome to come to this platform to share what you’re going through.
In addition to seeking support from others, there are also things you can do to take care of yourself and manage your feelings. Here are a few tips:
2. Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself and practise self-compassion. Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel the way you’re feeling, and try not to judge yourself harshly.
3. Mindfulness and Relaxation: Practise mindfulness techniques or relaxation exercises to help calm your mind and body. This could include deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.
4. Seek Professional Help: Consider reaching out to a therapist or counsellor for additional support. They can provide you with coping strategies, a listening ear, and a safe space to explore your feelings. I hope you’ll consider reaching out to your school counsellor who can then guide you on strategies to deal with exam stress too.
I truly do hope that the days ahead are filled with more smiles and laughter for you too. I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I’m struggling with family, friends, work and now even my relationship is going down. I became the problem of everything. I get frustrated, sensitive, annoyed and things. My dog became sick and I had to look after him while i’m on a week leave. Went back to work and I was dump with tons of work and has tight deadlines. I work for the government hence i’m unable to go home on my weekdays. I sustained a long term injury on my knee from work last year which restricted me from doing outdoor activities or even doing work. I can’t take off or even leave from work because there’s so much work to do and my superior aren’t approving it. My relationship became another issue that i’m constantly having fights with my partner. My friends ditched me on my birthday because they aren’t free when we made plans beforehand.
I became so lonely and felt like i have nobody to go to. I can’t speak to anyone here at work, home or friends. I started to starve myself at work and force myself to throw up whenever i eat. I can’t sleep at night because i’m constantly thinking about what is wrong with me. I cried every night hoping the next day wouldn’t come.

Thank you for coming to this platform to share what you’re going through. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re facing such a tough time. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot on multiple fronts, and it can feel overwhelming. You’ve already shown a lot of strength by managing your depression in the past and by taking care of your dog despite everything you’re going through. Reaching out here is another sign of your resilience and courage. It takes a lot to open up and seek support, and that’s something to be proud of.
It seems that struggling with family, friends, work, and your relationship all at once is incredibly difficult. It must be very frustrating to feel like you’re the problem in every situation. Taking care of a sick pet while dealing with a knee injury and a heavy workload must be exhausting. You are handling more than anyone should have to, and it’s no wonder you’re feeling overwhelmed.
It must have been incredibly hurtful when your friends cancelled last minute on your birthday plans. Feeling let down by those close to you can deepen feelings of isolation and loneliness. May I check, did your friend share a valid reason for cancelling or make attempts to repair the situation? Additionally, did you let your friend know how hurt you were by their cancellation? Speaking up and being assertive about your needs can help ensure that your feelings are acknowledged and addressed in your relationships.
Wondering if people will notice you’re missing sounds like you’re craving connection and bonding. This is achievable by learning better communication strategies. Sharing with people directly what you wish or want can enable them to know your needs, and they may be able to respond better in a way you would like.
Remember, your self-worth doesn’t change based on other people’s reactions. You are valuable and important just as you are. Self-care is a lifelong, ongoing process, just like taking care of your physical health.
I’m concerned about you forcing yourself to throw up and starving yourself. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of hurt, and this requires extra support. Not eating well can impact your gut health, which in turn affects hormone health and mood regulation. I strongly encourage you to reach out to a psychiatrist for assessment and professional support for tailored guidance. If you’ve had therapy before, consider reaching out to your therapist again, or find a new one who can help you navigate through this. If you feel comfortable, please share what has held you back from reaching out to your psychiatrist or therapist again.
In this moment, it may feel like things can’t improve and everything feels overwhelming. I hope you’ll remind yourself of your many wonderful traits and the strength within you, and give yourself permission to take things one step at a time. I hear that you can’t take leave, so I hope you’ll be able to try the following self-care suggestions: take breaks when possible, even a short 5 mins to practice mindful breathing can help improve your nervous system regulation. Taking care of your physical health can have a positive impact on your mental health. Try to maintain a balanced diet, get regular exercise within your physical limitations, and ensure you’re getting enough sleep. Even small routines can provide a sense of normalcy and control. Just aim to do something pleasant for yourself even if it’s just for a minute a day and slowly build up that duration.
Even if it feels like no one understands, try to talk to someone you trust about what you’re going through. This could be a family member, a close friend, or even a colleague who you feel comfortable with. Opening up can be the first step towards feeling less isolated. Here are some suggestions on how to start the conversation:
2. Write It Down: If talking feels too hard, write a letter or message explaining how you feel. This can help you organise your thoughts and make the conversation easier.
3. Choose a Comfortable Setting: Find a quiet and comfortable place where you can talk without interruptions. This can help you feel more at ease.
4. Be Honest and Direct: Share your feelings honestly and directly. You might say something like, “I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately and I need someone to talk to.”
5. Share Specific Examples: Give specific examples of what you’re experiencing to help the other person understand your situation better.
6. Ask for What You Need: Whether it’s just someone to listen, advice, or help with specific tasks, let the person know how they can support you.
7. Prepare for Their Response: Understand that they might not know what to say right away. Be patient and give them time to process what you’ve shared.
8. Consider Professional Support: If you find it hard to open up to those close to you, reaching out to a mental health professional can provide a safe and confidential space to share your feelings.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter! I truly hope the days ahead begin to improve for you sooner.

I was on my way to work as usual, and out of a sudden, I felt terrified inside the train and started breaking into sweats. I was trembling and felt like I cannot breathe. I ended up u-turning back home and called in sick for the next 3 days. This happened again shortly after this first episode in early Jan 2023.
I visited 2 GPs for help, but they both said that I have irritable bowel syndrome because I also had symptoms like feeling nauseous, dizzy, stomach cramps etc.
Initially, I was very conscious every time I make my way to work, I try to go to office later to avoid the crowd as I thought it might be the crowd that is making the whole experience worse. But it didn’t really help as I still experienced it time to time.
It slowly died down, but it is still always in the back of my mind and recently coming back at full blast after a train breakdown.
I am not sure what led to these, and recently I feel a lot worse where my heart would be racing when I am doing nothing, I feel breathless sometimes as well. I feel generally unwell and don’t know where to seek help.

I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing this and it must be tough to be dealing with something unknown. It takes a lot of courage to be sharing your feelings and I want to commend you for that.
Can I ask if something happen on the way to work the first time you experienced this in December 2022? I wonder if you have experiences like this due to crowds in the train or is it due to concerns about work? It might be helpful to identify the triggers to these experiences so you can get appropriate support.
I am asking if it is due to work because you mentioned that this usually happen when you are on the way to work, not back from work or when travelling to other places? Sometimes, if there is something at work that is of concern, our body might adopt an avoidance stance towards it and it comes out in ways like this.
It might be helpful to speak with someone about how you are feeling, to gain new perspectives about your situation and perhaps to join the dots to why you are feeling these experiences. It can be a trusted friend or family member. If you find it challenging to talk to your family or others directly or if you need additional support, you may also consider reaching out to a mental health professional like a counsellor or online platforms. They can provide a safe space for you to explore healthy ways to work around your emotions.
Here are some platforms you can consider:
2. Limitless - Talk To Someone - Limitless
3. IMH CHAT - Home - CHAT
4. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH ) - 1800-283 7019
Also, during the panic attacks, it is helpful to find a space and calm yourself down. You may alight from the train and go to a corner to do so before getting onboard again. Here are some suggestions for you to consider trying:
2. Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
3. Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.
You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).
I hope this is helpful and that you are able to find out why it keeps happening. Do seek support if needed and remember that you are not alone in this.

The strange thing is, nothing happened to me on the way to work before. The trigger I am suspecting is my fear of not being able to go to a toilet on time. There were a few memorable incidents where I desperately need to visit the toilet but am stuck on a long bus ride or traffic jam. Thankfully, I didn’t make a mess on myself but I was wondering if this fear is what is impacting me as I do notice I tend to have these panic attacks whenever my stomach is feeling unwell and the feelings get out of hands and translates into light-headedness etc. I usually have to dash out of the train to visit the toilet, and sometimes there is indeed some urgent bowel movements.
It does happen when I am on the way home from work as well. I tried speaking to my family members and friends but unfortunately its hard for them to understand how scary it was for me and it is often brushed off as me overreacting and that I should not worry so much…
I have reached out to a social worker before and she said it might be because I have agoraphobia and that I fear of being trapped with no escape and in my case, unable to get to the toilet in time. However, I feel that its slowly impacting my daily life although its only once in awhile because the feelings are so intense that I am unable to focus on my work.
And thanks so much for your advices! Will definitely keep them in my head and apply them when needed.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for letting me know your thoughts, I am glad to hear that you will try to apply the suggestions!
Good that you gave it some thought! Perhaps you can consider going to the toilet before boarding trains or buses, or taking a light comfortable meal before travelling.
I am sorry to hear that you don’t get helpful support from your family or friends when you shared with them. It must feel hurtful to be dismissed. I hope you remember your feelings are valid. Everyone has different fears and concerns, and your concerns are definitely real. It is like someone can be afraid of heights, or cockroaches and perhaps others can emphasize with them because it is so common. It is just that your concern is more unique, thus people might have difficulty understanding that.
While it affects you, please do not take it too personally. Try out different ways to alleviate these concerns of yours and I hope things get better for you!",,0,,19296,,19296.0,

We have actually broken up multiple times and gotten back to together. The issues in our relationship usually stem from my actions due to me messing up and making stupid mistakes and she would get very upset with me. In the past I had been friends with some people who had questionable morals and being young and impressionable these traits had rubbed off on me. This caused me to be a selfish and disrespectful person especially towards my girlfriend who did not deserve this treatment. Because i was surrounded my these friends i had, i thought my the way i thought and acted was normal and i couldn’t wrap my head around why my gf would get upset at me so much so often and it caused many fights with her. In the beginning i was the one that broke up with her multiple times because i could not sit with her being mad at me so much. Through these fights i did slowly understand that maybe there was something wrong with the way i was and i should be treating my gf better than i am and that there are valid reasons for her to be upset with me. However, these thoughts were stuck in my head and my actions were not following i was still stuck in my old ways and my gf continued to get upset at me. I really could not handle people being upset at me at that stage in my life and it caused me to push her away and break up with her because i though i could never improve enough to deserve her and she would still always be upset at me. For that break up i genuinely thought that we would never get back together and she would not want me after that. I felt utterly worthless and because i thought i would never have a chance with her again, i entered a self destructive phase and made grave mistakes i deeply wish to take back and i regret so much i am so disgusted with myself. By some miracle, i had gotten back with my gf after some period of time, on the condition that i cut off my two best friends for reasons related to my self destructive phase and after some hesitation i did cut them off because i really love my gf and i want to be with her. However, i was still an idiot. Because i was so shocked that she would get back together with me, i did not tell her the full true story about my mistake and lied to her about some part of it. Eventually, she found out a few months later and her trust towards me was broken again. I have really been doing my best to redeem myself for my mistakes but i am afraid it will never be enough. I have deeply hurt my gf so much but i still very much want to be with her and make up for everything. Because of my actions she questions her self worth, she feels deeply hurt and goes through very difficult periods sometimes because the times I’ve hurt her come rushing back and triggering her again. Now shes reminded of the hurt I’ve brought on her again and she is contemplating if she should stay in the relationship. How do i save my relationship? How can i do more to be better? I’ve been trying to listen to what she tells me and improve myself but its hard for me to remember everything and be consistent because its hard to form habits and this hurts her. So how can i be better? she has issues trusting me because of my actions and my lie, now she cant trust when i say i love her even though i truly do love her so much. I really need help, i want to spend the rest of my life with her and i dont want to lose her please.",,1,19212.0,,,,

I’m sorry to hear of the heartache you and your ex are experiencing now. A breakup isn’t a comfortable process. Your willingness to seek help and be vulnerable shows significant strength and a genuine desire to grow. It’s commendable that you recognise your past mistakes and are taking steps to improve yourself. This self-awareness and your commitment to change are powerful assets that can lead to a healthier relationship and a better future. Thank you for coming onto this platform and sharing your story. It takes courage to admit faults and seek advice, and it’s a good step towards positive change. Well done!
May I suggest, first and foremost, practising self-compassion. Acknowledge the struggles you’ve faced and understand that while some of your past behavioural choices may have been unhelpful, they were often attempts to cope with difficult emotions and situations. It’s important to recognise that these actions don’t define your worth as a person. What you have now is an opportunity to unlearn old habits and learn healthier, more constructive strategies for navigating challenging situations. Instead of beating yourself up for past mistakes, focus on the fact that you were doing the best you could with the resources and understanding you had at the time.
It also sounds like you may find it difficult to delay gratification, leading to impulsive actions without fully considering the consequences. Acknowledging this tendency is the first step toward change. By developing more patience and learning to weigh the pros and cons before acting, you can make more thoughtful decisions that align with your long-term goals and values.
A thriving relationship requires both parties to develop a wide range of skillsets, such as communication skills, conflict resolution skills, and a growth mindset. Each of these categories encompasses many sub-skills, including active listening, whole-body listening, non-verbal communication, feedback delivery, feedback receptivity, self-awareness, and positive self-talk. When a relationship encounters difficulties, it’s helpful to view these challenges as gaps in skills rather than deficiencies in either person. These are essential life skills that can be learned and improved over time. Ideally, these skills would have been modelled by our caregivers, but if they were not, it’s still possible to learn and develop them now. Once again, it’s important to give ourselves grace and kindness.
It’s understandable that your ex-girlfriend might need space and time to grieve the loss of the relationship. Her desire for space shows a sense of self-awareness and the ability to set healthy boundaries. This is a sign of her strength, as prioritising her well-being during this time is no small feat. Be proud of her for recognising and honouring her needs.
It’s common for couples to experience difficulties and sometimes, even after challenging situations like an affair, relationships can be repaired. Other times, the relationship may not continue, but the lessons learned can help both individuals grow and become better partners in the future.
Perhaps giving her space and respecting her boundaries while you both work on improving your relationship skills separately might be the kindest approach. Sometimes, having the space to reset and focus on personal growth can be beneficial for both parties.
You might also consider creating a proposal outlining your plans for improving your self-regulation skills and sharing it with her. This shows your commitment to change and allows her to decide her next steps.
In the meantime, here are a few suggestions to get started with self-regulation for your consideration. The goal is to find the next ‘just-right’ step for yourself rather than trying to do everything at once. I suggest picking just one item from the list below to start with, and then build on from there:
2. Recognise Your Emotions: Start by identifying and acknowledging your emotions as they arise. Pay attention to physical signs like increased heart rate, sweating, or tension, which can indicate that you’re feeling stressed or upset. Use a feelings wheel to help you in naming the varying degrees of emotions.
3. Pause Before Reacting: When you feel a strong emotion, take a moment to pause and breathe before reacting. This can help you respond more thoughtfully rather than impulsively. Practice Mindfulness exercises to stay present and aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or mindful walking can help you stay grounded.
4. Set Clear Goals: Establish specific, achievable goals for your behaviour and emotional responses. This can give you a sense of direction and purpose in regulating your actions. It’s important to measure the daily wins instead of just looking at the gap. Aim to improve just by 1% each day and by the end of the month that will be 30% better.
5. Reflect and Learn: After experiencing a strong emotional response, reflect on what triggered it and how you handled it. Consider what you did well and what you could improve next time.
6. Seek Support: If you’re struggling with self-regulation, consider seeking support from a therapist or counsellor. They can provide guidance and tools to help you manage your emotions more effectively.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Thank you for reaching out for support. It makes sense to feel stuck as you want the role and you also want to be honest. It’s great that you’re seeking new job opportunities, even if you’re feeling a bit uncertain. Navigating job applications, especially questions about personal topics like counselling, can be tricky. Here are some suggestions that might help:
2. Understand the Purpose: Employers may ask about counselling to ensure that employees have the support they need, and it may not necessarily be a negative mark against you. It’s important to consider whether your concern is based on actual evidence or simply fear. Additionally, some believe that if a company does not hire you because of your counselling experience, it may indicate that the company has limited support and understanding for its employees’ overall well-being.
3. Consider Your Response: If the question asks whether you have ever sought counselling, there is value in being honest. However, you can also consider the context in which you provide this information. You might answer “yes” and be prepared to explain how counselling has helped you become more resilient and effective.
4. Frame Your Experience Positively: If the topic comes up in an interview, focus on the positive outcomes of your counselling experience. You can say something like, “Yes, I have sought counselling in the past, which has helped me develop better coping strategies and improved my overall well-being. It’s made me more prepared and motivated to take on new challenges.”
5. Know Your Rights: Yes you are right that according to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), discrimination in hiring based on mental health is not acceptable. You have the right to be considered fairly based on your skills and qualifications. If you feel that you have been discriminated the option to report it is available too. You may also want to reach out to career coaches ( WSG, NTUC) to get their assistance on how to navigate such conversations.
6. Prepare for Potential Questions: If you anticipate questions about your counselling experience, prepare thoughtful responses that highlight your growth and readiness for the role.
It’s important to be true to yourself and honest in your applications. Remember, seeking counselling is a sign of strength and a commitment to your personal growth. I hope the above has been helpful, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need more support.
Wishing you the very best,

Thank you for sharing how you’re feeling. It sounds like you’re going through a tough time with your friend Deva. I can see how much this situation is hurting you, and it’s completely understandable to feel upset and left out. Losing a close friend, even temporarily, can be incredibly painful. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your feelings, and it shows how much you care about your friendships.
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:
2. Give Deva Space: If Deva has asked for space, it’s important to respect her wishes. This shows that you care about her feelings and are willing to give her the time she needs. Deva’s need for space is understandable as she processes her hurt, and giving her that time shows your respect for her emotions.
3. Apologise Sincerely:
Express Regret: Start by clearly stating that you are sorry for what you did. Be specific about your actions, for example, “I’m really sorry for sharing your secret.”
Acknowledge the Impact: Show that you understand how your actions affected her. You might say, “I know this hurt you and broke your trust, and I feel terrible about that.”
Take Responsibility: Avoid excuses and take full responsibility. Say something like, “It was wrong of me to share your secret, and I take full responsibility for my actions.”
Write a Letter: If a face-to-face apology isn’t possible right now, writing a letter can help you organise your thoughts and convey your sincerity.
Face-to-Face Apology: When Deva is ready, apologise to her in person. Make sure you’re calm and focused on listening to her feelings.

8. Face-to-Face Apology: When Deva is ready, apologise to her in person. Make sure you’re calm and focused on listening to her feelings.
9. Reflect on Your Actions:
Journal: Keep a journal to reflect on why you shared Deva’s secret and what you’ve learned from the situation. Writing down your thoughts can help you process your emotions and learn from the experience.
Discuss with a Trusted Adult: Talk to a parent, teacher, or counsellor about the situation. They can offer guidance and help you understand different ways to handle similar situations in the future.
Identify Triggers: Think about what led you to share the secret. Understanding your motivations and triggers can help you manage similar situations better next time.

12. Identify Triggers: Think about what led you to share the secret. Understanding your motivations and triggers can help you manage similar situations better next time.
13. Stay Connected with Other Friends: Spend time with other friends and family members who make you feel supported. It’s great that you have people like Taylor, Kitty, and Amy to lean on during this time.
14. Take Care of Yourself: Feeling left out and upset can be really hard. Make sure you’re looking after your mental and physical health. Talk to your parents or another trusted adult about how you’re feeling. Practise self-compassion and forgive yourself for your mistake, recognising that everyone makes errors and it’s part of learning and growing.
15. Be Patient: Friendships can take time to heal. Be patient with Deva and with yourself as you navigate this situation. Use this experience as feedback for growth and to build better friendships in the future.
- Express Regret: Start by clearly stating that you are sorry for what you did. Be specific about your actions, for example, “I’m really sorry for sharing your secret.”

Thank you for coming here to share your feelings with us. It must be hard feeling this way when people are sharing such topics with you. I appreciate that you admit that you sometimes agree with you and able to relate with what they are feeling, though it is difficult for you to listen.
It seems like you hold family values dear to heart and these are your beliefs. It is important to validate yourself for having such feelings. Perhaps that’s why you find it difficult to listen to people when they do not seem to appreciate their family. I want to assure you that it is normal to have such feelings because you feel strongly about certain things.
Maybe you can consider letting them know that while you appreciate them sharing, and it must be tough to deal with such situations; these topics are rather sensitive for you and you might not be the best person to provide them with the support they need. Do let them know that you are definitely open to support them with other areas of concerns, if you want to.

I know I shouldnt compare, but i always feel pressured that my peers are already securing a job, leading their wonderful life while I am still like stuck here.

Thank you for taking time to share your struggles with us here. It does take a lot of courage and strength to be so open with your feelings, and I would like to affirm you for that.
Currently, it sounds like you are spiralling downwards in negative thoughts, it feels frustrating and helpless. I think it might be helpful for you to think about what has been going well for you. It seems like you are doubting your earlier decision to take a break for your mental well-being. I must say that’s a brave move and I am glad you took this step.
Sometimes, people feel bad for taking a break as life seems to keep moving for others. I would like to remind you that it is okay to move at different pace. What matters most is your goals and your mental well-being.
You mentioned how hard it is to even get yourselr out of bed. Maybe to you, it sounds basic. But it is a huge step to take for anyone with low motivation levels. So I want you to affirm yourself on being so strong in getting out of your bed to look for jobs and to even be on this platform to share your feelings.
When you learn to affirm yourself more and appreciate the steps you take, you can be more confident about yourself and empower yourself to take more steps forward.
It sounds tiring and you have come far, in your own pace. If you need more motivation, you may consider the following suggestions:
2. Self compassion. Speak kindly to yourself. Remind yourself of how far you have come. Focus more on your strengths, not comparing yourself with others. You are unique and special in your way.
3. Less self-blame. Maybe you think that your decision to take a break was a wrong decision or that you could have been more productive during the time.
Or consider this. Maybe this break is something you really needed before you step into the working world. Maybe you did not need to be productive because this is a break. Try taking a different perspective so you feel less stuck.
4. Make plans. Try making a routine and planning your steps. Breaking down your goals might seem less daunting and easier to achieve.
5. Seek support. Talk to your family or friends and be connected with them. Now is not the time for you to be left alone with your thoughts as you are spiralling.
6. Be engaged. Find activities to do that you enjoy so you get motivation to get out of bed easier. Get physical, do some exercise to warm up your body and you might feel more energetic.

Thank you for embracing vulnerability and sharing your challenges with us. Receiving a medical diagnosis can be very difficult, and it’s natural to need time to process it. Contracting HSV-1 is more common than you might think, and many people live full, healthy lives with it. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated HSV-1, which typically causes oral herpes, affects about 67% of the global population under the age of 50. This translates to approximately 3.7 billion people. These percentage highlight that HSV is a widespread condition, affecting a significant portion of the world’s population. It’s a common virus, and having it doesn’t mean you are alone or that you have done something wrong. Many people with HSV live normal, healthy lives.
HSV-1 can spread through non-sexual contact, such as kissing or sharing utensils, and can be transmitted even when there are no visible symptoms. This means it’s not something that could have been easily prevented. Please allow yourself some grace and compassion. Please don’t let one medical condition overshadow all the strengths and qualities you possess. You are more than your medical condition.
If you’re comfortable, could you share whether you vomited after eating because the sores were causing you physical pain or if it was due to feeling overwhelmed emotionally? May I suggest reaching out to trusted and reliable resources for information on managing and living with herpes? Sometimes searching online can create more anxiety than clarity. Consult a medical doctor or counsellor to receive support in understanding this condition and learning how to continue living well. The DSC clinic may be able to share with you if there are any support groups available that you can join.
Here are some Singapore-based articles that I hope you’ll find helpful in knowing that you aren’t alone in managing this medical condition.

- “A lady whom I really care for just told me that she has herpes….”
Having some suicidal ideation after receiving life-altering medical diagnosis is common. However if these thoughts persist, please reach out for support. Here are some community-based resources for your consideration.

I ate and vomited again and again, feeling so stressful about the situation. I felt so helpless in everything, everything that I am doing now felt so unmotivated. I keep hearing voices like “Serve you right”, “ That’s what you get” and laughter around me. This is causing me to unable to rest well, this few nights even starts having nightmares. I am feeling so tired, have no strength to live on for any hopes. The medical doctor I had visited is giving me less and less hope. Telling me that I am unlucky to receive this disease, after hearing this from him, my world just falls apart, all the hopes just shattered. I don’t know what can I do anymore. I know there is others who also has this disease, I admired those people. But I am born in a family with lots of issues, I can only tell my mom about this. But it’s unbearable for me to see her crying by herself because of me. I can’t even stop crying while writing this comment. Maybe this time death is the easy way out of this problem. I really do want to see the rest of world but I can’t really find the courage to do so.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing more with me. I appreciate your trust. What you’re describing sounds really heavy and painful. I’m sorry to hear about your struggles. It sounds like you and your mom have gone through hardships and have a close bond. I don’t imagine your mom being able to recover if she lost you. It is indeed a lot harder to make sense of the medical condition when the doctor isn’t giving you hope. I’m sorry to hear this doctor didn’t offer you much empathy or support. I hope the option of going to a different doctor and getting a second opinion is available to you.
If you’re comfortable, could you please share more about the voices you’re hearing? It’s important to understand whether they resemble your own inner thoughts or if they sound like external voices. Could you describe the characteristics of these voices? For example, are they male or female? Do they sound soft and gentle, or loud and harsh? Additionally, do these voices remind you of anyone you know? Understanding these details can provide valuable insights into what you’re experiencing and how we can best support you.
Crying while writing this post lets me know that the pain is still a lot for you now and everything seems really scary.
Bethany Hamilton once shared that “Courage doesn’t mean you don’t get afraid. Courage means you don’t let fear stop you.” I’ve always found Bethany Hamilton to be a real inspiration for me. She was the inspiration behind the movie Soul Surfer. She was 13 years old and lost an arm in a shark attack. She had dreams of becoming a professional surfer and there was a scene in the movie where she learns of her challenges and is broken down. That movie scene reminds me a little of your situation where you feel beaten down and the odds are against you. With resilience and determination and small steps day by day, she worked towards realising her dream of being a professional surfer and is now a great inspiration to many others.
Your dream of seeing the rest of the world is possible. Many people are living with Herpes and are also able to enjoy a full life. With the right support and guidance you too can enjoy better days ahead. It will be challenging and uncomfortable at first but it is still possible to come out of this diagnosis stronger.
I would like to suggest a first step, will you please consider visiting a polyclinic and sharing everything you’ve shared with me with a doctor there. They can offer medical advice on managing and living with Herpes, and the doctor could make a referral for you to receive further support for your mental health. Seeking professional guidance can be a valuable step towards finding the support and resources you need.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I know if I suicide, my mom will be sad and unable to cope about my suicidal. But I really can’t think of anything else that suicidal. I have been planning my death for a long time, but when I see my mom, I will thinks if I am gone, what will happen to her, can she take care of herself? I actually wanted to retest again for the HSV test, but I am really afraid what if the results is the same, what will I do if that happens? I tried to relax and sleep but often woke up in a dream of me jumping or euthanasia in another country. I can’t really tell anyone what happening to me, all the stuff is causing me to not able to breath. I am feeling suffocated from all of these problems. I would like to visit another doctor but I am too scared. I can’t really think having a sticker on myself saying HSV person here, stay away from me.
The voices that I am hearing are like inner voices but they don’t resemble anyone. The voices that I heard the most is a older male’s voice, then a female’s voice, and a teenager’s voice. For the older male’s voice, he sounds like a friend or a brother to me, he sounds gentle and caring, often offers his suggestion to me to make like when I am thinking on what should I eat for lunch and others. For the female’s voice, is like harsher to me, often scolding and lecturing me. For the teenager’s voice, he is often laughing at me, when I would like to do something, he would be there saying “are you sure that she is treating you as a friend” , “you can’t be friends for life” , “ they will despise you if you told anyone your problem” . None of these voices sounds anyone that I have known. I have tried to visit Polyclinic near my place, when I reached the front door, the voices appeared saying “they will laugh at you if you walk into the door” , and I will starts hearing laughter around me. I am always having such a stress situation.
I felt so suffocated right now, I don’t dare to reach for help at all, what if everything just disappear, would it be better for me? I have actually asked others doctor, but hearing HSV facts from them, caused me to be more scared and anxiety in everything that I do. I am even thinking that my mom is placing a line between me and her. I can’t stop thinking and the voices aren’t even helping this time, now the voices are like “See, after telling your mom, she is placing distance between her and you” , “you should have never told anyone”. I am really scared, I even stop being the old side of me which is cheerful and happy in everything. What should I even try to do?",,0,,18926,,18926.0,

It also sounds like to me that there are a lot of perceived negative responses from those you shared this issue with, but i hope you also continue to hear more opinions from ppl like us here, that this illness does not define you nor does it change the value and significance of your life to this world and the people around you. among all the voices that may suggest otherwise, pls know that right here, we believe you are okay and we value you!
you can try to reach out to the community-based resources that @CoolBreeze suggested! Surround yourself with more positive voices who do not think the illness define you~
You can also try to seek more scientific and objective knowledge regarding this illness, so there isn’t any misconstrued perspective on what getting this illness mean. there may be misconceptions from ppl who are not well informed so it feels really scary, but those arent true! it is alike any other virus, like covid or other flu virus, that your body will build immunity against it and you will be alright with the right treatment. i didn’t know much abt this illness either, but i googled abt it and i thought maybe this article here will address some of your fears and concerns.

Thanks for sharing with us so much even in your vulnerable state. I think it takes a lot of strength for you to be typing this despite how you are feeling and I am really glad you are seeking help for yourself in such ways.
You are definitely right about how sad your mom would be if you are not around. No parent would ever want that to happen to their child. I am sure she will support you through ups and downs. That is what family is for. If your loved one is going through a tough period, I am sure you would want to be of support to them, rather than having them leave you. Even though the journey may be tough and sad, it is better to go through together right?
It seems like your thoughts are overwhelming and confusing right now, thus the voices in your head keep coming. I can only imagine how frustrating and stuck it feels to be in your shoes right now. The fact that you are sharing your concerns with us, shows that you want to be supported, that you need connection at this moment, and not to be left alone in this journey. Nobody should have to go through this alone and you should not too.
Perhaps, it might be helpful to consider 1 person in your life who you think can be trusted and will be able to support you. Don’t deny yourself of the connection you need. It is hard to be dealing with these thoughts and feelings on your own. The first step would be tough as you are battling with the concerns of whether people would judge you. I hope you trust that there are people who love and care for you deeply, and they would never want to see you in this state where you are battling this on your own.
Also, the voices could mean that you are sinking deeply into self-blame. Here are some techniques for to consider:
2. Acknowledge your feelings. Recognize that you are blaming yourself for your current situation, it is natural to feel this way but it is not helpful when these thoughts get too overwhelming and intrusive. Anger and regret are strong feelings you may experience and acknowledging them is part of processing your emotions. Denial will only prolong the process and make you feel more stuck.
3. Self-compassion. Be kind to yourself as you process this situation and know that you have made a mistake. Even if the solution is not your most desired outcome, there are alternate ways out of it.
4. Forgive yourself. Know that you did not want for this to happen. People make mistakes, you deserve forgiveness and I hope you give yourself permission to move on. Visualize yourself letting go of this guilt that you are holding on to. How does it feel like and what would it take for you to reach there?
Lastly, I really hope you can be patient with yourself through this. And also, seek support if possible. Help is available as long as you reach out. I hope you find the strength in you to work things out. Do take care.",,0,,18934,18934.0,18934.0,

Thank you for sharing more with us. I wholeheartedly agree with everything @Raindrop shared with you. I encourage you to give those strategies a try. Additionally, consider writing down every unkind thought you encounter and then counter it with a positive affirmation. This practice will help you improve an important life skill of reframing unhelpful thoughts into more constructive ones.
For example:
Unhelpful Thought: “Are you sure that she is treating you as a friend?”
Positive Affirmation: “I choose to trust in the authenticity of our friendship. I am deserving of genuine and supportive relationships.”
Unhelpful Thought: “You can’t be friends for life.”
Positive Affirmation: “I believe in the possibility of long-lasting and meaningful friendships. I am open to nurturing connections that bring joy and support into my life.”
Unhelpful Thought: “They will despise you if you told anyone your problem.”
Positive Affirmation: “I recognise my worth and value, and I deserve empathy and understanding. I trust that sharing my thoughts and feelings will strengthen my relationships and lead to greater connection.”
Unhelpful Thought: “They will laugh at you if you walk through the door.”
Positive Affirmation: “I am confident in my worth and abilities. I choose to enter with self-assurance, knowing that I am deserving of respect and acceptance. I am not defined by others’ reactions, and I hold the power to shape my own experience.”
I hope you’ll always remember that you hold the power to reshape your thoughts and beliefs, empowering yourself with positivity and self-assurance. Wishing you the very best, please take good care of yourself.

Sorry for the late reply, was visiting doctors for the past few days. Yup, I did take @CoolBreeze @Raindrop @duckling advices and visited the doctors. The doctors asked me to do another blood test, but unfortunately I was really contracted HSV-1. The doctors that I now visited said it is normal and don’t be scared, but tbh it’s scary for me. Thank you for telling me this all the kinds words, it really means a lot to me right now. The situation has been getting worse and worse for me, but since I started chatting with you guys @CoolBreeze @Raindrop @duckling , I have started to feel there is a bit more positively in this situation. I have tried thinking that this illness doesn’t change anything, it is just a virus going inside me. But in reality, I tried to think that way and I failed, I just can’t seem to think positively about this illness. From the moments that I heard from my doctor saying that I had contracted HSV-1, my mind just went completely dark. The fear and concerns starts to overwhelm me, and I felt like I am stuck deep down a fully dark river, I tried to swim to the top get out of the river but finding me to sink deeper and deeper and eventually failed trying to get out. I frequently thinking what’s my purpose of life, felt extremely lost in direction about my life for a long time, long before I even contracted this illness, after contracting this illness, the situation adds up to another level of stress for me.
After contracting the illness, I started searching for more informations and try to understand more about the illness on the web, but unfortunately after reading lots of the informations about the illness on the web, I just starts to get trapped in the negatively process and can’t stop thinking about the negativity, from there I will slowly get into an anxiety state where everything became a disaster for me. The voices and laughter began to start more frequently, saying things I heard so many times. Lately, I have found myself to have difficult times in breathing normally, my chest starts to feel compressed and every breath hurts, the mind continues to be in a fully negative state. everything that I tried doing can seem to cheer me up at all, I just keeps crying and crying, the mind just keeps on repeating on all the negative things like “the doctor say you are so unlucky to get this illness” , “your friends will turn against you once they heard you have this illness” , “ no one loves you” and so on.
I have actually tried some online sessions with some doctors about this illness, but all I can heard from them is there is no cure for this illness, you are stuck with this illness for life, you need to take care of yourself and so on. After hearing this, my mind just stop functioning, all other advices or informations that the doctor tried to let me know just can’t pass it through my mind, the negative mindset keeps on messing around, voices appearing before, in between and after the online sessions. The article that you shown is pretty helpful to me, but I just can’t get over the negative mindset. I am even thinking of signing up a clinical trial tests at overseas that primarily focus on this illness. I do understand that I will have immunity over time, but the fear just keeps on coming to me. As I am also scared that I will be unable to get married and date someone in my life. I am scared that people will run away from me because I have this illness. Is HSV really common in Singapore and Malaysia? The doctors told me that all people have antibodies in them, it’s just they doesn’t know about it.
As I am now seeing doctors for help, I might not be able to reply so frequent, it will takes a couple of days to reply back. I do hope that I will become the previous side of me, cheerful and happy.

Thanks for giving us an update. I’m glad the second doctor sounds a lot more emphatic to your medical situation. Receiving a diagnosis like HSV-1 can indeed be overwhelming and frightening. It’s normal to feel scared and anxious, especially when faced with the uncertainty and stigma often associated with this condition.
It’s also completely understandable that you’re finding it hard to stay positive right now. Sometimes, despite our best efforts to think positively, our minds can get stuck in a cycle of negativity. The important thing is that you’re reaching out and trying to find ways to cope and understand your condition better.
Remember, HSV-1 is very common, and many people live full, happy lives despite the diagnosis. The initial shock and fear will gradually lessen as you adjust and learn to manage it. It’s okay to feel what you’re feeling—there’s no right or wrong way to react to such news.
Please also know that having HSV-1 doesn’t make you any less deserving of love and companionship. Many people with HSV-1 have healthy, loving relationships. Open and honest communication with future partners is key, and you’ll find that there will be people who understand and support you. While some might not, and those moments can feel uncomfortable, remember that this does not reflect your worth or potential. Your self-worth and self-esteem are non-negotiable. You are deserving of respect and love, regardless of your health condition. I hope you’ll be patient and trust that the right person will be able to look past any initial hesitation and work with you to manage the condition while living well together.
Regarding your symptoms of anxiety and physical discomfort, it might be beneficial to discuss these with a mental health professional. They can provide strategies to manage your anxiety, help you develop a more balanced perspective on your diagnosis, and support you in dealing with your emotions as you navigate the days ahead.
Lastly, take your time to process everything. Healing and adjusting to this new reality will take time, and that’s perfectly okay. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself to feel and express your emotions without judgment.
We believe in your strength to get through this. Keep reaching out for support and remember that it’s okay to take things one step at a time. Your mental and emotional well-being is just as important as your physical health.
Thank you again for trusting us. We’re rooting for your journey toward healing and self-acceptance.",,0,,19186,19186.0,19186.0,

But i just cry, even at movie scenes. If a Father shows care and that they do love their child, i find myself pathetic for displaying such a dumb emotion.
It’s not like i crave that type of care from my own father, now that i feel of. But whenever i see such things i have just let the tears spew like an idiot.

Thanks for being so open to share such vulnerable feelings with us. I must say you having such emotions are not a sign of weakness and it is not pathetic. It sounds like you have been through tough experiences with your father and that he can be rather verbally abusive. Feels difficult to endure and I really want to commend your effort in still staying strong.
From your sharing of your relationship with your father, it sounds like he does not make you feel worthy and says words to make you feel bad about yourself. It is normal and natural to develop a certain yearning for a healthier relationship with your father. And it is definitely hurtful when you see others having this desired relationship with their fathers. I think you are really strong having to cope with these intense feelings since young.
I wonder if you have anyone you can trust to talk to, like a family or friends, about your feelings. It must be tough bearing all these feelings on your own and I don’t know how you have been managing all these years. If it helps, I hope you can reach out to people for emotional support and perhaps to gain clarity about how you are feeling.
If you find it challenging to talk to your family or others directly or if you need additional support, you may also consider reaching out to a mental health professional like a counsellor or online platforms. They can provide a safe space for you to explore healthy ways to work around your emotions.
Here are some platforms you can consider:
2. Limitless - Talk To Someone - Limitless
3. IMH CHAT - Home - CHAT
4. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019
I would also like to encourage you to be kinder to yourself when you are struggling with such thoughts about yourself. You are not weak, in fact you are very strong. It takes a lot of courage and resilience to experience what you are going through. I hope you don’t let your father’s words get to you, even though I know it is hard.
You are worthy and you are good enough. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself. Be kind to yourself as you process your feelings. Take some time to engage in activities you enjoy or find ways to be good to yourself because you deserve to be treated well.

I’ve knelt outside my house crying and chanting scriptures. Been degraded to peasantry. Been forced to eat out the trash with him shoving the food down my throat. Been made to write lines over 500 times in multiple times. I’ve been through it all. He gives wild punishments and has made me want to commit suicide multiple times.

He has destroyed my sense of morality in parental love.
When i tell my friends that ive been caned since 5 and had gone through multiple near instances of threats of divorce amongst my parents. They yell out that it’s abuse. Is it? I don’t know anymore. My father had put both me and brother through hell and back. He flung books at my brother while he (bro) knelt against a wall and sobbed. My story is not the worst ones out there, but it is good enough for me.
Its just that my father also shows that he cares, i know. He buys us stuff, all the books i want, he gets them for me. Even after shattering my sense of pride and destroying my mentality and canning me 30 times as i knealt on the ground. He laughed and joked with me once i was done kneeling outside and chanting 1000 times in repent. I forget about all the things for a second. I stop crying and ignore all the pain to smile and joke with him.
I might write another one of these about my emotions. But for the moment, is this normal? Im not really going indepth with all my feelings yet. But based off this nutshell version, Is this normal?",,1,,,,,

And I feel it is not healthy either. No one deserves to have their sense of pride shattered or have their mentality destroyed, or to be treated in a way that causes one to have suicidal thoughts. I’m sure you feel similarly thus youre reaching out for help, so I hope to affirm you on this thought yeah!

It sounds painful and heartbreaking to hear that you are experiencing these over the years. I think you are really strong and resilient seeing how you have been coping with your situation and such intense feelings. And I am really glad to hear that you have reached out to your school counsellors to seek support, that is so brave of you.
It sounds like you are going through a cycle of abuse from your father. Some information on this, the cycle of abuse involves four stages: building tension, an incident of abuse, reconciliation, calm (repeat). The times when he shows you that he cares would be the reconciliation stage. Also, the cycle keeps repeating itself through the years and it is definitely not healthy. When you are a victim of abuse, it can make you feel powerless, frustrated, or confused, thus finding it hard to break free from the abuse.
The fact that you are wondering if it is normal says a lot about what you feel. I would like you to trust your feelings a little more. Perhaps you have seen or heard about how other families interact with each other or received information/support from your school counsellor to help you understand more about healthy family relationships. I hope you don’t doubt yourself so much and validate your feelings. Your feelings are valid and need to be acknowledged. Often times, people who go through abuse have been manipulated to believe that they caused the abuser to be angry and getting blamed for the abuser’s behaviour. Do remember that the responsibility lies with the abuser, not the victim. No matter what you did or didn’t do, abuse is never your fault.
From your sharing, you seem to feel that this family dynamics isn’t healthy but your experiences have wired you to think otherwise. Do take time to read up about healthy family relationships or the cycle of abuse. I hope it will give you more insights about what is happening at home and help you trust yourself more.
For now, let’s try to take a step at a time to process these experiences. You may consider the following suggestions:
2. Self-care. Make yourself a priority and focus more on your needs. Give yourself positive affirmations and encouragements. Remind yourself of your strengths and believe yourself more.
3. Less victim blaming. It is to stop blaming yourself because you did nothing wrong. By blaming or doubting yourself, it could enable the behaviour of the abuser and it gives them the ‘right’ to punish you in their own ways.
4. Acknowledge the actions. As hard as it might sound, these actions by your father are not right. Sometimes it can be difficult to hear that and acknowledge because you have been going through this for a long time. it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that your father is not doing the right thing as a caregiver.
5. Seek support. Do talk to your family members, friends or your school counsellor about your experiences and feelings. Talking helps in gaining new insights and perspective towards your situation. It may also help in validating your emotions and offer emotional support.
6. Keep yourself safe. If possible, work out a safety plan with your school counsellor. This is in case things escalate and you are at risk of being hurt. When there is a safety plan in place, it may be easier for you to make decisions during such times.

I hate it when I’m at home because I have to hear my parents quarrel and I can’t handle arguments well I always end up crying / breaking down every time I hear them argue. But at the same time I hate it when I am outside because I don’t know whether things will become violent and I’m scared that something bad happens when I am outside. I have major exams coming up this year and their arguments are really making me lose focus and scared. Things haven’t gotten violent yet but it seems to be getting worst. This and my anxiety makes me constantly worry for the worst and it’s adding on to all the stress I’m receiving at school. I don’t know how to stop them and I feel powerless and torn between whose side to stand on. They’re always talking about divorce and I really don’t want that to happen. I’m really sad and I wish things would go back to normal. Is there even anything I can do? They’re arguing almost everyday and the atmosphere at home is always tense.,,1,,,,,

I’m really sorry to hear about what you’re going through at home. It must be incredibly tough to deal with constant arguments and tension between your parents, especially when you’re trying to focus on your studies and exams. It breaks my heart to learn that sometimes you don’t feel as safe in your home as you should feel.
It is okay to cry and feel your feelings when you feel overwhelmed. Crying is a natural response for our body. There is no shame in feeling your feelings and then releasing them. I can only imagine the constant struggle you are undergoing between wanting to be away from the quarrels and at the same time also not being able to enjoy yourself while you are out of the house.
It makes sense that you feel powerless and torn between your parents, it’s an awful place to feel caught between the two people that you love very much. Things can feel even scarier when there is talk about our parents splitting up. Thank you for choosing bravery and reaching out for support.
Please know that you’re not alone in feeling this way. There are many other students that also experience similar challenges, and it’s good to reach out for support. Well done on taking the first steps. We are here to listen and support you. You matter!
Here are a few things, I’d like to invite you to consider:
Sometimes in our lives, things happen that are out of our control, for example, how hot the weather is. We can’t control that directly AND there are small things that we can do that are within our control. For example, when it’s very hot we can choose to go to a cooler place like in the mall, stay in the shade, and drink lots of water to help our body stay cool. Similarly, how your parents fight and if they stay together, that sadly may be beyond your control.
What is within your control is letting your parents know how you feel. If you feel safe you can speak to them and let them know how their fights are impacting you, share with them some boundaries like from 6 pm to 9 pm, no fights in the house as you need to study. If talking to them feels really scary, you may want to try leaving them a WhatsApp audio or text or even a hand written letter.
If you sense that you will not be safe to try the above ideas, please reach out to other trusted adults, like an aunt, uncle, or even grandparents. You can also approach your school counsellors or teacher to help you. Sometimes adults can listen better when another adult shares with them how their fights are impacting you.
I like to encourage you to reach out to a counsellor so that you can receive the support of:
2. someone safe to explore your feelings and receive validation
3. someone to brainstorm with you alternative strategies
4. someone to help you regulate your feelings
5. someone to remind you of your strengths and abilities
6. someone to journey with you as you experience discomfort
It isn’t your responsibility to manage your parent’s feelings. We can only be responsible for helping ourselves to feel better and learning skills to communicate our needs and wants to others, especially to our parents. Here are some skills to practice to help our body feel calmer and safer when we are feeling our big uncomfortable feelings:
1.) Calming breaths:
Deep Breathing (Diaphragmatic Breathing): This involves breathing deeply into your diaphragm to promote relaxation and reduce stress. Here’s how to do it:
- Sit or lie down in a comfortable position.
- Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen.
- Inhale deeply through your nose, feeling your abdomen rise as you fill your lungs with air.
- Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth, feeling your abdomen fall.
- Repeat for several breaths, focusing on the rhythm of your breath and allowing your body to relax with each exhale.
4-7-8 Breathing (Relaxing Breath): This technique is known for its calming effects and can help reduce anxiety. Here’s how to practice it:
- Inhale quietly through your nose for a count of 4 seconds.
- Hold your breath for a count of 7 seconds.
- Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth for a count of 8 seconds.
- Repeat the cycle for a few rounds, maintaining a steady and relaxed pace.
Box Breathing (Square Breathing): This technique helps to regulate breathing and promote a sense of calmness. Follow these steps:
- Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of 4 seconds, imagining tracing one side of a square.
- Hold your breath for 4 seconds, imagining moving along the top of the square.
- Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth for 4 seconds, tracing the opposite side of the square.
- Hold your breath for 4 seconds, completing the square.
- Repeat the pattern for several cycles, focusing on smooth and controlled breathing.
2.) Progressive Muscle Relaxation is a relaxation technique that involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in the body. Here are the steps:
- Start by finding a quiet and comfortable space where you can sit or lie down without distractions.
- Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes if that helps you focus better.
- Begin with a few deep breaths to relax your body and mind. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and exhale slowly through your mouth.
- Tension and Release: Follow these steps for each muscle group:
- Hands: Clench your fists tightly for a few seconds, feeling the tension in your hands and forearms. Then, slowly release and let go of the tension, feeling the muscles relax completely.
- Arms: Tighten the muscles in your upper arms by flexing them and holding for a few seconds. Then, release the tension and let your arms feel heavy and relaxed.
*Shoulders: Raise your shoulders towards your ears and hold them tense for a few seconds. Then, gently lower your shoulders and let go of the tension.
*Face: Scrunch up your face by squeezing your eyes shut and clenching your jaw. Hold the tension for a moment, then relax your facial muscles completely.
*Chest: Take a deep breath in and hold it, feeling the tension in your chest and abdomen. Exhale slowly and release the tension, allowing your chest to feel light and relaxed.
*Back: Arch your back slightly and tighten the muscles in your lower back. Hold for a few seconds, then release and let your back sink into a comfortable position.
*Legs: Straighten your legs and tense the muscles in your thighs and calves by pointing your toes upward. Hold for a few seconds, then release and let your legs relax completely.
*Feet: Curl your toes tightly and flex your feet upward, feeling the tension in your feet and ankles. Then, release the tension and let your feet rest comfortably.
- After tensing and relaxing each muscle group, take a moment to notice the difference between tension and relaxation. Focus on the feeling of relaxation in each muscle group.
- If you feel like you still have tension in certain areas, you can repeat the progressive muscle relaxation steps for those specific muscle groups.
*Finish the session with a few more deep breaths, inhaling calmness and exhaling any remaining tension or stress.
3.)Guided imagery
- Choose a quiet and comfortable space where you can sit or lie down without distractions.
- If you feel comfortable, close your eyes to help you focus inward.
- Start by taking a few slow and deep breaths. Inhale through your nose, hold for a moment, and exhale through your mouth.
- Imagine a place where you feel completely relaxed and at peace. It could be a beach, a forest, a cozy room, or any other calming location (real or imaginary) you can think of.
- Picture the details of your chosen place in your mind. What do you see around you? Are there trees, water, animals, or other elements? Imagine the colors, shapes, and textures.
- Engage all your senses in the visualization. Imagine what you would hear, smell, touch, and even taste in that environment. Create a vivid sensory experience in your mind.
- Add positive affirmations to your visualization. Repeat phrases like “I am calm and peaceful,” “I feel safe and relaxed,” or any other affirmations that resonate with you.
- Stay focused on the present moment and immerse yourself fully in the visualization. Let go of any distractions or thoughts that come up, and just enjoy the serenity of your imagined place.
- Spend as much time as you need in your visualization. There’s no rush. Enjoy the tranquility and allow yourself to unwind.
- When you’re ready to end the visualization, slowly bring your awareness back to your physical surroundings. Take a few more deep breaths and gently open your eyes.
4.) Music - Sometimes just listening to calming music can help to reduce stress and anxiety too.
If ever things get violent at home and it’s no longer safe for you or a family member, you can call the police (999) for help. It’s important to take care of yourself and prioritise your well-being during this challenging time. If you need more support please reach out.
Wishing you the very best! You got this!
Kind Regards,
Cool Breeze =)

It’s okay if you don’t dare to share your feelings with them now. It’s good that you are aware of what makes you feel safe and what does not. Here are some other suggestions for you to consider:
- Practice self-care and self-regulation, this can help you remain calm internally even though there maybe challenges outside. See my above post and try those resources.
- Perhaps put on headphones and listen to music, podcasts or audiobook to drown out the external noise. Move to a different space if the arguments are happening in front of you.
- Stay in school to study, find study pods and when worrying thoughts come up, try any of the self- regulations skills mentioned above and then remind yourself that your parents’ actions are out of your control. What’s within your control is to choose what to give your attention to. You can choose to give your attention to things that are out of your control or to things within your control like studying, developing your friendship, taking care of your physical health through regular exercise, balanced nutrition, adequate sleep, and practicing good hygiene.
- Whenever you feel ready to share your needs, try using the ""I statements’ strategy:
For example:
- I feel scared when I hear raised voices during arguments.
- I haven’t got the strength to listen to this now, can we take a pause please.
- I need a calm environment at home to feel safe so that I can do well in my studies.
These statements can help you express your feelings without blaming or escalating the situation.
- Would it be possible to reach out to your overseas relatives, is there anyone that you think might be able to help?
- If yes, perhaps you can consider reaching out to them. If no, perhaps it might be time to reach out to your school counsellor or teachers. Sometimes adults can listen better when another adult shares with them how their fights are impacting you.
I like to encourage you to reach out to a counsellor so that you can receive the support of:
2. someone safe to explore your feelings and receive validation
3. someone to brainstorm with you alternative strategies
4. someone to help you regulate your feelings
5. someone to remind you of your strengths and abilities
6. someone to journey with you as you experience discomfort
A counsellor will be able to customise a support plan to your needs and go at a pace that is comfortable for you.
I wish I could give you a quick fix but unfortunately sometimes things take some time before they become better and in the mean time all we can do, is do our best to manage things that are within our control. I hope the above strategies are helpful; please do try them out.
Wishing you the very best!

I know this is actually really stressful, much more since you will be taking some exams. It’s alright to feel powerless in situations like this, trust me, I understand. You might not have the power to stop these quarrels since they are the adults. BUT, you have to care about yourself as well. It may be taxing as well judging by how much it is affecting you. You should try reaching out to the school counsellors in your schools, it will help you let loose all your pent up feelings and worries. Try doing things you enjoy and help out around the house a little more to make up some harmony. But the most I can really tell you to do Is to speak with the professionals in your school!

I realised i had this issue since young as I talk to myself alot be it at home or in public. And because i keep talking to myself, i actually liked the idea of wearing mask as no one is able to see my mouth movements.
My thoughts run super fast, like very fast and therefore alot of times i realise my thoughts control me more than I control them. So often a times i realise that i will walk aimlessly without realising what i am doing cuz i am carried away by my thoughts. Additionally, because i often have conversations with my thoughts, i realised that alot of times, i tend to mumble and talk to myself often in public… Even if people cnt hear, they can see my mouth movements which to be honest i am very conscious about it esp cuz i also got loud voice but i feel like i cannot control because if I dun talk my tots out, i would not be able to get rid of the thought… So i just wanted to ask is it normal to talk in public?
In addition to that i realise i tend to have OCD about some of my thoughts. For instance, if sth interrupted my thought (eg someone pass by me) i will feel like my tot process is being interrupted and I need to rethink the whole thing agn which takes alot of time… Even small things that interrupted my tot process, i will need to repeat the whole thinking process and I will need to say the whole thing agn which could be irritating but i cant help to do so. So i kinda need help in fixing this cuz it is really to the point i think i am crazy",,1,19176.0,,,,

TBH, I often do this cos it helps me to sort of relieve my stress. I guess it’s normal cos it’s similar to talking to another person, just that we talk to ourselves instead of other people. And, as you said using a mask will come in handy so that you won’t really look awkward.

I guess you are more of an auditory person in that you can make sense of your thoughts when you say it out loud rather than keeping silent. I feel you can use a paper to pen down your thoughts if your thought process tends to get disrupted midway. At least you can get back to whatever you were thinking about once things get back to normal.

Thank you for sharing such personal feelings with us on this platform. It sounds like you are often carried away by your thoughts and I am not sure of speaking those thoughts out loud gives you more clarity. I want to affirm you that this is more common than you think and you are not crazy for talking to yourself.
People talk to themselves for several reasons. It could be a kind of cognitive processing method, to gain clarity which is like speaking with someone to connect the dots. Sometimes, it might be a way people process information or regulate their emotions. It could also be helpful in terms of controlling impulsive behaviours by proving a moment to reflect before acting on certain thoughts.
While these can be a kind of coping mechanism, you might want to consider seeking support if you feel bothered by such actions. I think at this point, you seem rather aware of yourself, thus reflecting on whether this is helpful or not. It seems more like you have a lot on your mind and it is frustrating you to quite an extent.
Would you consider speaking to a friend or family member to gain new insights or perspectives towards your situation? Not so much about the part on talking to yourself, but more to discuss the thoughts that are running in your mind. I get a feeling that you are currently feeling stuck and that’s why you find it difficult to stop thinking about it.
If you find it hard to stop the self-talk, you may want to consider adjusting the content of self-talk. Negative self-talk can lead you down a negative spiral and it is not helping your situation as you may feel more discouraged. Positive self-talk would sound like giving affirmations to yourself and reflecting on what you are good at. You have shown resilience in the way you try to cope with this difficult situation. It is definitely discouraging when things don’t go your way or when you don’t feel motivated to change anything. I am sure your resilience can pull you through this challenging time again.
Please remember that you are not alone and try to reach out to someone to share about your feelings. It may feel difficult right now and I hope you get the strength to navigate around this.",,0,,19169,,19169.0,

Secondly, going through the posts, I figure there are a lot of young participants here. Don’t know if there are any adults here who can relate to grief.
My dad died when I was 9. My mom told me I didn’t shed a tear.
I don’t cry at wakes or funerals.
However, 2 years back, after the passing of one of my close friends, I noticed that I would shed tears when I was doing computer work. Dismissed it at first that I was staring too hard at the screen but things didn’t get better.
Later that year, another ex-colleague passed on and it was when I started getting depressed and started hallucinating.
Long story short, I have seen counsellor, psychologists and psychiatrists over close to 2 years.
Despite SSRI and being discharged when hallucinations stopped, I still don’t feel that I have gotten over this.
I was brought up as a stoic. Constantly told that men don’t cry. Even if I intellectually understand that crying can be cathartic, somehow my body tenses up and refuses to do so.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles. First off, there’s nothing to apologise about the way you post in this community - we’re here to listen and hope you feel supported, especially with what you’ve gone through.
I think it takes a lot of courage to open up and seek professional support when it comes to dealing with grief; more so when your existing coping skills appear to be overwhelmed. I also hear you about your beliefs and upbringing that continue to shape the way you perceive things, and how it manifests in your body reactions and negative feelings - I think that what you felt going through what you experienced in the way you knew how to - is valid.
I think that you seeking assistance and being on medication means that you also have an understanding on the effects of your thinking shaping that way you feel and behave, and the interconnectedness of one another towards how you feel, think and react in certain situations (especially those that bring up or trigger memories of loss).
I wonder what your experience with counselling and therapy like - what did y’all work on, what did you find working/not working for you? Did y’all manage to identify some coping skills that would be helpful? I wonder like if you could do therapy differently, what would you do instead?
At the same time, the stages of grief is not linear and I think you’ve probably cycled through or experienced them many times through the years. Having said that, I think that your experience with grief is unique to you and it would be highly unfair or critical of me to think that it can be resolved in a standard fashion. It’s true that you feel the dissonance between not crying and getting the benefits of crying it out, and this is where you can decide how you would want to honour your grief. You can choose the time or place or the manner you want to express/show/write/shout/demonstrate/craft/create whatever you wish or want that you find helpful, supportive or needed for you in this moment. And, I’m right here, waiting to listen to you as I feel that there’s more to learn about you and your experience, so please type whatever you feel like sharing.

Grieving without tears is a unique aspect of the grieving process, and it’s important to acknowledge and respect your individual way of coping. First and foremost, it’s crucial to be patient and compassionate with yourself. Grieving is a personal journey, and there is no “right” way to experience it.
Consider exploring alternative outlets for processing your grief, such as journaling, art, or engaging in activities that bring solace. Expressing your emotions through words or creative outlets can be just as cathartic as shedding tears. Additionally, continue to engage with supportive professionals, friends, or family members who can provide understanding and guidance on your journey.
Remember that healing from loss is a gradual process, and there’s no set timeline. If you feel comfortable, share your experiences and feelings with those close to you, as it can foster a sense of connection and support. It’s okay to seek ongoing counseling or support groups to navigate the complexities of grief. You’re not alone, and there are various ways to manage grief beyond tears.

I knew I had to seek professional help when the hallucinations started. It was a sign that I was not mentally able to cope with what was happening to me.
The first counsellor I spoke with over 3 sessions was from my workplace. I shared what happened and she noted that I had lost a lot in my life, especially in my 25 years of teaching. We discussed the possibility that I should quit the service and at the end of the year when the hallucinations started, I left full-time teaching. I then went on to a psychologist at the Polyclinic. He was in a way, the most helpful with coping strategies.
I started wearing a cap to limit my field of vision so that I would reduce the chances of my seeing things that I shouldn’t. I started journalling to organise and process my thoughts. Things were better controlled but the hallucinations didn’t go away. He referred me to a psychiatrist at a hospital. I was prescribed 2 types of SSRIs to manage my symptoms. Over the next few months, the hallucinations stopped and the psychiatrist reduced the SSRIs and eventually discharged me.
My original psychologist left the polyclinic and I was assigned to a new one who diagnosed me with trauma, based on the deaths that occurred during my years as a teacher. She suggested that I get help from the private sector, professionals who know about EMDR (a form of psychotherapy).
Currently, I am only seeing a doctor to get SSRIs as the psychologist has discharged me.
In my jounalling, I realised that I hadn’t cope with grief well and there was a lot of deaths in those 25 years. Lost a student who died on the bus on the way to school, another who died in his sleep. Lost a colleague to suicide. Hand the stillborn of a very dear colleague and helped him with funeral arrangements. Lost a colleague to sudden death post surgery, among many others. It was apparent to the psychologist that I was overwhelmed.
However, my family is here for me. I am still seeking ways to get over this heaviness in my heart. I have tried creative ways but it isn’t helping much.
I want to stop the SSRIs. I want to stop feeling like this. I am exhausting alternatives and I am feeling very exhausted.

Thanks for sharing your story @Notearsformula. You’ve gone through so much, I’m not sure if the average person would have seen so many deaths around them. You’re right that the group counseling may not have been the most relevant one. I wonder if there are other support groups out there for ex-frontliners like yourself (eg SPF or SCDF where they deal with multiple deaths too). Although I think your case is quite unique because you would have formed a relationship with each of these people.

The doctor has reduced the dosage but I will still need SSRIs to maintain my mood.
Because of all the deaths around me, I constantly think about my own and I have made preparations for my own passing. AMD, LPA and funeral arrangements etc.
Frankly, there was a time I had to stop myself from thinking about suicide. I am against it and I will not act on it but somehow the thoughts do form in my head.

Thanks for sharing, @Notearsformula. Actually that’s the most important part right? To have the mental clarity to not act on it. I’m glad you’ve made the promise with your wife and you’re still here.
I know your initial question was to see if there are ways to manage this grief without taking SSRIs. I’m not a doctor so I can’t really advise on the alternatives but actually I wonder if you’ve thought of sharing your story with more people - eg to your teaching community since you’ve taught for 25 years.

Death is a part of life, and it is not a topic that most people are comfortable to talk about. But avoiding it doesn’t mean it no longer exists.
I remember when I was barely a teenager, a classmate of mine committed suicide. My schmates and I (we were all in a boys sch) and we all cried at his funeral. I was not close to him, but decades since then I still remember him, still remember his funeral wake. We all moved on but we never forgotten him. 3 months later, a cousin younger than me passed away overnight. Hours before she passed away in the hospital, she was sleeping in my room. I never forgotten either of them.
Since then there have been other deaths I know of, and I don’t forget them either.
We cry because they matter. They matter to us, they left footprints in our hearts. And we mourn and grieve for their loss in our own respective ways.
And you crying/dropping tears doesn’t make you weak. You thinking of your own mortality does not make you weak. On the contrary you are strong because of it, because you are allowing yourself to be emotionally vulnerable and facing the very thing (death) that scares all humanity. That takes strength, that takes emotional courage.
As a fellow human being, maybe you are struggling with how meaningless it seems, or that you are struggling with your own helplessness wondering if you could have done more or done anything at all to save those lives, or perhaps you feel abandoned. I won’t know, but I do know and remember what it is like to feel helpless.
But the challenge… and struggle, is to learn how to live with the sense of helplessness and coming to terms with how some things in life are just simply beyond our control and the only thing sometimes we are left to do, and find ourselves in, is to grieve and remember those who have left this world. Each death will hit us especially those who has left an impact in our lives, and they will forever weigh heavy on our hearts and it’s okay to feel that weight.
But the lives of those who have gone before us have meaning, because they remain in our hearts, long after they are gone.
We are not in this world to save everyone, it is not humanly possible. I hope you will be able to find it in yourself to forgive yourself for the things you thought you could have done, and hold your head up high because you have already done your best.
You miss them in your heart. You wish you could have done more perhaps. Whatever the reasons, talk about them as often as you need to. But know that you are not alone in this world grappling with the senseless ways that death takes people away from us.",,2,,12276,12276.0,,

You are right. They were a part of my life and they did matter. Some more than others. I do miss them even though outwardly I do not show it. I know my limitations and don’t regret anything that I have no control over. I am not illusioned with the idea that I could have, would have done things differently. Life plays out as it does with every one of us.
Cognitively, I keep telling myself that. Hence, my friends tell me that I am possibly the least likely to be depressed. I can mentally process and accept things and function. I can distract myself with the business of life. But when the quiet comes, when I wake up at night, it’s a different thing. One counsellor said that I have high-functional depression. No one would look at me and think that there’s anything wrong with me. I suspect it has become chronic.
Understanding the big scheme of things doesn’t assuage feelings. Acknowledging the feelings on a mental level isn’t managing the feeling itself. Telling myself that I should be sad is a cognitive act. I need to get out of this vicious circle.
My wife told me that I am too rational and logical and need to be in touch with my feelings. I have been so in control that ironically, it’s reflex now to suppress them.
The weight of losing a life accumulates with every passing. Unfortunately, I know it doesn’t really go away, but with so many before and yet more to come… I am at a loss myself.",,1,,,,,

But that might possibly be coming from the rational side of you, whereas how you feel about it could be a completely different story.
When my ex-classmate took his life, I wasn’t close to him at all. Rationally I know there was nothing I could have done, and it shouldn’t hit me hard at all since I’m not close to him at all, but yet I still cried at his funeral. And 20++ years since his death, I still remember every scene at his funeral.
I also remember that once upon a time when I was explaining a heart aching situation to my very first boss. He merely listened before remarking to me that everything I had uttered thus far were my thoughts. How do I really feel he asked. I was stunned for a moment because I thought that I was already articulating and explaining how I feel, but it took me that very same moment to realise that I was thinking about how I feel and narrating it, but not feeling how I feel, not in touch with my own feelings. And naturally once I allow myself to feel it fully, the floodgates open.
To feel would mean to fully feel our pain, our grief, our broken heart, our anguish, our loss.
Naturally it will be best for you to do all that in a safe environment with say a counselor/therapist.
In your very first post in the thread, you already asked, how does one manage grief without tears. Personally I think the answer is it is not really possible. If the people you lost matter that much to you, you will feel pain. And if it hurts that much, it’s normal to cry, normal to tear up. I cannot undo the countless times you have been told by others that men don’t cry.
I can only tell you that my dad cried when my grandmother passed away. My uncles cried. My ex-classmates (boys sch) all cried when our classmate passed away. I cried (more often than I can count) at various points of my life. I don’t see myself or any of them as less of a man.
Their tears, their pain, their anguish, show me that the people they lost matter to them. There is no shame in tears.

I would love to cry at funerals. Problem is I can’t. I don’t know why. I just simply don’t. It is not for the fear of being seen as weak or unmanly. I just simply can’t. I have never cried at funerals. That is my problem. I wish I could. Then things wouldn’t have come to this. I wish I cried at all the funerals I have attended. It would have been much better than to be where I am now. On a few occasions, I even hugged my friends who are crying at funerals I attend. I wish I could cry with them. It just doesn’t happen.
I held my colleagues stillborn in my hands one night at the hospital. I was the only one they called. My colleague and his wife were crying for their loss. I stood there with them, holding their boy, I wanted so badly to cry. In the end I didn’t. They are still my friends because I was there for them. I didn’t even try to console them, something that they are grateful for till this day. I just stood with them quietly as they cried and said a prayer for the boy and for them. Not a single tear despite my wanting to do so.
Am I broken? Is there something wrong with me? If crying makes the pain go away, then I can always cause pain to myself and cry. If that is all it takes. Will hurting me heal me?
I am against self-harm. I have told my students never to hurt themselves. I intend to walk the talk. Hence, my asking for help. If the solution is so simple as to force myself to cry, why am I agonising over it? An iron to the arm? A blade to the wrist? I have seen enough to know what causes hurt and bring out the tears. I have a close friend who put an iron on his arm just to see which hurt more, his broken heart or the pain from the iron. I have 6 girls in one class who have cut themselves, first on their arms then moved to their thighs where it can’t be seen. They were victims of bullying. I sent them for counselling. I have seen enough to know that self-harm and crying because of the pain doesn’t solve problems.

I’m really sorry to hear about all the loses you’ve experienced in your life. It definitely sounds overwhelming.
I can relate to the part where you cannot cry, it definitely can be frustrating cause crying is known to help bring relief. However my psychologist would say that you can’t force something, it has to come naturally and hence if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.
I know you’ve sought a lot of professional help but not sure if you’ve ever saw a therapist that focuses on grief or did grief work, not sure if you’ve heard or explored the stages of grieve.


The process of grieving is never linear, you can go back and forth multiple times through the stages.
I wish I could help but I don’t know how to but all I can say is I wish you all the best in this journey. I would say what has helped me in my grief journey is to talk about my grief, talk about my emotions and this is kinda unique but I’m someone that finds it very hard to express my emotions and feelings so I’d like to visit the fragment room (https://thefragmentroom.com ), I’d imagine that whatever I was hitting was all my bottled up emotions and feelings and it’s a way for me to feel like I’m releasing all these bottled up emotions and feelings.

Thanks for sharing. The psychologist who attended to me did tell me about the stage of grief and mentioned that it is non-linear. I have gone through most of them with every passing and as you correctly mentioned, not all. Rarely the anger and bargaining. Talking to counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists did help me sort out what was troubling me in my head, journalling, medication all helped here and there. Talking about it to them did feel good. And they were able to label some things that I was thinking and feeling.
Like most people, I do have feelings for every student, teacher or friend who passes away. It does well up to a point. I admit I feel sad. I admit that I feel lost. For all that I feel, it just simply doesn’t translate to tears. If tears are critical, I need a solution. I have watchd depressing movies, think depressing thoughts, attempting to cry. All failed. Reflex kicked in and it stops before it comes out.
Thanks for the suggestion of the fragment room. I did read about it a long while back and I think it might help to vent all the growing frustration that I have over this.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and feelings with us on this platform. It takes a lot of courage to be so open in sharing and I appreciate that you are reaching out.
It sounds like you have been through a couple of losses in your life and I wonder if it is your body’s way of coping with these losses. Sometimes, the passing of a loved one can be emotionally overwhelming and it could lead the living ones to be in a state of denial/shock or disbelief. It could be a protective mechanism to protect you from experiencing the full impact of the grief.
Being stuck in that state might result in numbing of senses, thus the lack of emotion to process. Do know that unprocessed emotions can get stuck in our bodies and it comes out in various ways. Perhaps, in your case, it is crying over things you described as unimportant. I am not sure if you needed to be strong for your parents or relatives, thus this happens. But I would like to commend you on trying so hard to be strong for them.
Another reason might be due to cultural aspects, upbringing or observation of other people in your family. Through our understanding of how different people expresses themselves, there could be a possibility that you have learned to suppress your emotions during such circumstances. Naturally, when the body feels the need to release, those smaller or less significant events becomes a channel for you to express your emotions(maybe it feels safer also).
Understanding your body in its unique way of processing emotions would be helpful so you can get appropriate support. Do know that you are normal and you can feel emotions, that’s why you cry when some things happen. Let it out in its own pace, do try not to doubt yourself so much.
If possible, you may consider reaching out to a family member or a friend who you can trust to talk to and provide you with appropriate support. If you find it challenging to talk to your family or others directly or if you need additional support, you may also consider reaching out to a mental health professional like a counsellor or online platforms. They can provide a safe space for you to explore healthy ways to work around your emotions.

Thank you for sharing your feelings. It’s completely normal to want to have a big cry, especially when you feel like you have a lot of emotions bottled up inside. Crying can be a healthy way to release built-up emotions, and it’s understandable that you might feel frustrated when you can’t let it all out.
Crying serves as a natural emotional release valve, allowing us to express and process intense feelings like sadness, frustration, or even relief. It can provide a sense of catharsis, helping to relieve emotional tension and bring a sense of clarity or peace.
Sometimes, when we’ve been holding in our emotions for a long time, it can be hard to access them fully. Here are a few things you might try:
Create a Safe Space: Find a comfortable place where you feel safe and won’t be interrupted. Sometimes just having the right environment can help.
Write it Out: Journaling about your feelings can be a great way to process and release emotions. Don’t worry about how it sounds—just let your thoughts flow.
Here are some journal prompts you can use to explore your emotions:
2. How am I feeling right now? Describe the emotions I am experiencing.
3. What events or situations have contributed to these emotions?
4. Are there any patterns in my emotions or triggers that I have noticed?
5. What does my body feel like when I experience these emotions? Are there any physical sensations?
6. How do I typically cope with these emotions? Are these coping mechanisms helpful or harmful?
7. What are some things that have brought me joy or comfort recently?
8. What are some things I am grateful for, even in difficult times?
9. How do I talk to myself when I am feeling down or overwhelmed? Are these self-talk patterns supportive or critical?
10. Are there any changes I would like to make in my life to better support my emotional well-being?
11. What can I do today to take care of myself and nurture my emotional health?
Feel free to choose any of these prompts that resonate with you, and remember that your journal is a safe space for you to express yourself freely and without judgment.
Body Scan: Practice a body scan meditation, where you systematically bring your attention to each part of your body, noticing any tension or discomfort and allowing yourself to release it.
Grounding Exercises: Engage in grounding techniques such as feeling the sensation of your feet on the ground, or holding onto an object and focusing on its texture and weight. This can help bring your awareness back to the present moment and connect with your emotions.
It’s okay to take your time with this. Emotions can be complex, and it’s important to be gentle with yourself as you navigate through them. If you continue to struggle with releasing your emotions, talking to a counsellor might provide additional support and strategies. Sometimes we may be in a ‘freeze’ state and hence the tears can’t flow and we may need to use other movements to help the body ‘thaw’.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. Let us know what’s been challenging for you. Which scenes in a movie gets you tearing/crying? We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Thank you for sharing with us your pain, I hear you, and I can feel the weight of your emotions, and it’s completely understandable to feel this way after going through such a difficult and painful time. It’s natural to still have lingering feelings and to struggle with letting go, especially when there’s so much pain involved.
You know… The journey toward forgiveness and healing is not easy, and it’s okay to feel bitter and angry right now. Those emotions are valid, and it’s better to acknowledge them rather than push them away. It does take time to process everything that has happened and to come to terms with it.
Forgiveness doesn’t happen overnight, and it’s a process that involves allowing yourself to feel all the emotions that come with it, including anger and hurt. But with time and self-compassion , you can gradually release the hold that these negative feelings have on you.
I have some suggestions that I hope will help you through this process:
2. If possible, try to seek closure through communication. If you feel ready and it’s safe for you emotionally, you can consider having a calm and honest conversation with your ex about your feelings and the unresolved issues between you. Expressing your thoughts and emotions in a constructive way can provide closure and help you move forward. However, please do make sure to set boundaries during this difficult conversation
3. Remember to practice Self-Compassion and Self-Care! Try to engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, whether it’s spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or practicing mindfulness and meditation. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, and remember that healing takes time. By taking care of yourself, you’ll have more capacity to process your emotions and eventually find forgiveness and peace.
Last but not least, please do be patient with yourself and to give yourself the space and grace to heal. Do also surround yourself with supportive people who can offer comfort and understanding during this challenging time, like your friends or family members, or even a counsellor If you need to talk to a professional (therapist or counsellor), please know that there are available places for you to seek support, such as the Family Service Centre or these online options:

4 years is a loooooong time. It’s probably a long enough time for memories to creep back at every corner of your life - every little thing might just trigger memories of him. Do you still hope to salvage this relationship?
If you’d like to move on, it’s not going to be an easy journey but I guess you can start by channeling your energy towards something that you like. It can act as a distraction and possibly help you hone a skill too.
And like @Otterworldly said, maybe reconnect with some friends and see if any of them can help you through this period.

Thanks for sharing your feelings with us on this platform. It must be hard to feel this way about your family and it is understandable that you feel because of your interaction with them. Do know that your feelings are valid and I hope you acknowledge them.
I wonder what you meant when you talked about disobeying your mother and whether you are aware of why do so. Could you be seeking some attention from her, and have you communicated with any of your family members about your feelings? It sounds like you are trying very hard to improve your relationship with your family and I would like to commend you on that. It is definitely not easy and I appreciate that you are still trying!
It is important that people around you knows what you are going through so you can be supported in ways that are helpful. Sometimes, people might not be aware of how their actions are perceived and you might want to consider talking about it. Talking about your feelings are helpful as they can help you gain new insights and perhaps some encouragement about your situation.
I believe you have positive qualities and strengths that make you special to your family as well. Do take some time to think about that as you might not be focusing on yourself as a whole person. Also, when you focus on yourself, you might compare yourself with your siblings lesser. It might be more helpful this way as you navigate through this situation.
If you can, do try to think about the things you can do to bond with your family. Creating positive experiences with them, based on similar interests or fun activities might help to improve your relationship.

12530,feeling ignored,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/feeling-ignored/12530,Coping,---,7296,CoolBreeze,Professional,Professional,19067,2,"Dear @kavya,
It’s incredibly tough to experience feelings of being ignored and numb, especially when it feels like there’s no one to confide in. You’re definitely not alone in this; many young people have grappled with similar emotions. Your feelings are entirely valid, and it’s important to acknowledge that. It can feel overwhelming when it seems like everyone perceives your life as flawless while internally, you’re battling. But please remember, your emotions matter, and seeking support is absolutely okay. Thank you for reaching out. Well done for taking a step in the right direction.
Feeling numb can often be a coping response your mind uses to protect you from overwhelming emotions. When situations become too stressful or painful to handle, your brain might try to shut down your emotional responses to help you get through the tough times. While this can provide temporary relief, it can also make it difficult to connect with others and enjoy life. Understanding that this numbness is a response to feeling overwhelmed, and it’s not about who you are as a person can be the first step in finding healthier ways to cope and eventually, addressing the root causes of your distress.
Here are a few things you might consider:
2. Acknowledge Your Feelings: It’s important to recognise that your feelings are valid. For example, you might say to yourself, “I feel ignored and numb right now, and that’s okay. These feelings are my mind’s way of telling me that something isn’t right. It’s okay to feel this way, and it doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with me. It just means I need to pay attention to what my emotions are trying to tell me.” Recognising and accepting your feelings can be the first step toward understanding and addressing them. It can be helpful to use a feelings wheel to help name the emotions.
3. Talk to Someone You Trust: Even though it might feel like everyone thinks your life is perfect, there’s usually someone who will understand. It could be a close friend, family member, or a trusted adult like a relative or a teacher. Opening up might be scary, but it can also be a huge relief.
4. Journal Your Thoughts: Writing down your feelings can help you understand them better. It’s a way to express what you’re going through without worrying about others’ reactions. Here are a few journal prompts to get you started:
What are the situations or moments when I feel the most numb?
How did I feel right before I started feeling numb?
What do I wish I could say to the people around me about how I’m feeling?
If my numbness could speak, what would it say?
5. What are the situations or moments when I feel the most numb?
6. How did I feel right before I started feeling numb?
7. What do I wish I could say to the people around me about how I’m feeling?
8. If my numbness could speak, what would it say?
9. Seek Professional Help: Sometimes, talking to a counsellor or therapist can make a big difference. They can help you figure out why you’re feeling this way and provide strategies to cope.
10. Self-Care: Engage in activities that make you feel good. Whether it’s a hobby, exercise, or simply taking a break to relax, taking care of yourself is crucial.
11. Reflect on Your Needs: Think about what might be missing or what you need more of in your life. It could be more social interaction, a sense of purpose, or even just some time to rest. For example, you might realise you need more time with friends, so you could plan a regular meetup or join a club. If you feel a lack of purpose, consider volunteering or starting a new project that excites you. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, try setting aside time each day to relax and unwind, whether it’s through reading, meditating, or taking a walk. Here are a few journal prompts to help uncover your needs:
What activities or people make me feel energised and happy?
When was the last time I felt truly content and what was I doing?
What aspects of my life feel unfulfilled or empty?
What small changes can I make to bring more joy and satisfaction into my daily routine?

- What are the situations or moments when I feel the most numb?
- How did I feel right before I started feeling numb?
- What do I wish I could say to the people around me about how I’m feeling?
- If my numbness could speak, what would it say?

- When was the last time I felt truly content and what was I doing?
- What aspects of my life feel unfulfilled or empty?
- What small changes can I make to bring more joy and satisfaction into my daily routine?
To better understand your feelings, it might help to consider a few questions: When did you first notice the numbness? How often do you feel this way? Can you recall your earliest memory of feeling numb? Reflecting on these questions might give you some insights into your experiences and help you find ways to address them.
Reaching out for support shows a lot of courage, and it’s a big step towards feeling better. Your strength in facing these challenges and seeking help is commendable. It’s okay to not have everything figured out. Taking small steps to address your feelings can lead to big changes over time.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing a tough period and it seems like people around you are unable to understand what you are going through. It is really hard when you are unable to receive the support you need, especially through these tough times.
I would like to thank you firstly, for coming to this platform to share your feelings with us. I think it takes a lot of courage to open up about your feelings and experiences, and I really want to affirm you on that. It also seems like you are very aware of what triggers you, that’s why you are seeking an alternate way, that is staying at a student hostel. It shows how much you value yourself and treasure your life. It is unfortunate that this happened to be a short-term arrangement as you have to move back home.
I am sure you have tried different ways in the past to cope with what’s happening at home, and that you have managed to survive all these years with it. I wonder if you are feeling frustrated as you felt that there is a way out, and you are being pulled back into the same situation again. If so, I hope you can take some time to think about what you did in the past to cope and hopefully those could support you through this period again. That is until you are able to find other alternatives.
When you say that everybody is making you promise you won’t hurt yourself again, it sounds like there are people who care for you. It may not be the way you want them to, but the intentions are to support you. I wonder if there is any way you can communicate your concerns to them and explore together on what other ways can they be of support to you. Do you think it will be helpful if you speak to your father about how you feel and that you would really like to get his support by providing you with what you need, it could be professional help or other changes in your life.
I see that you are trying your best to study, that shows how important your goals are. And I do not want you to give up on these goals, because they motivate you to endure through challenging times. I hope that you are able to find alternate coping ways that are helpful and not hurtful to yourself. Here are some alternate suggestions for you to consider trying:
2. Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
3. Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.
You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch,
3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).
4. Fidget toys – It can be something to keep your hands occupied and to provide sensory stimulation without causing hurt to yourself.
5. Physical activity – It can be to walk around, jump a little, anything to release any pent-up energy within yourself.
6. Talking to people. Do reach out to trusted family or friends to talk about how you are feeling. Talking through experiences helps to gain new perspectives and insights. It could be encouraging as well.
7. Self-care. It can be mental and physical actions where you eat/sleep well, engaging in hobbies you enjoy or being good to yourself because you deserve to be treated well.
8. Positive self-talk: It is important how you speak to yourself. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself. You are strong and you have survived through many obstacles in your life. It is definitely discouraging when things don’t go your way. I am sure your resilience can pull you through this challenging time again.
I really hope things get better for you. Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need. Do keep us updated on how you are coping, we would really like to continue to support you here on this platform.",,0,,18733,,18733.0,

Is this your first job out of school? I can share my own experience when I graduated out of uni. I studied social science & business and always found research work to be interesting. So I thought I will try find a job in a market research company because it combined my interest and training. I applied to a few global market research firms, got interviews with some, was rejected by some, and I did finally get accepted to one company. The first week in the company was training. After the first day, I knew this wasn’t a job for me but I stayed for the week. I quit thereafter and knew in my heart then that I needed to do something aligned to my passion. I knew myself better through this experience - I knew that I was someone who has little patience for “working” but am motivated to do good and improve society. So I switched my focus completely and looked for social services and government jobs. And I was hired into one agency and had the most fulfilling first career.
It can take anywhere between 3 months to 8 months to find a job, depending on the sector and your level of experience. Don’t give up hope! The right job will find you. I encourage you to speak with a career coach (look at WSG site) or an older working adult whom you look up to to seek inspiration and direction. They could give you input on your CV, give you tips on interviewing and dressing, and maybe point out jobs which are aligned to your skills and passion.
Understanding ourselves in often an important process. I encourage you to use some of the resources here in mindline.sg to know yourself better and find strength within.

Thank you for reaching out to us on this platform. Trying to land the ideal job is indeed challenging, and receiving multiple rejections can be very disheartening. It’s natural to feel pain and discomfort when it seems like you’re navigating a long, dark tunnel with no end in sight.
You have been coping with these feelings for a long time, and I want to commend you for your courage in sharing and your resilience in pushing on despite these strong, uncomfortable emotions. Reaching out for support is a positive step in the right direction. Well done!
Adulting and finding the right job that matches our lifestyle and needs can often make us feel like imposters. This is a common experience for many young adults transitioning to life after formal education. In school, things are structured and outcomes are more predictable, but in the real working world, these outcomes are not guaranteed, which can lead to fear and anxiety. Nevertheless, the life skills and strengths that got you through difficult moments in school can once again help you navigate life’s different challenges.
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:
Seek Guidance: Reach out to a career counsellor or coach to gain insights into your strengths and discover which roles may be more suitable for your personality. They can provide new perspectives and help you identify potential career paths you might not have considered. Additionally, they can offer tips and suggestions on improving your resume. You may want to check out NTUC career coaching.
Expand Your Search: Look beyond traditional job boards. Networking, attending industry events, and leveraging social media platforms like LinkedIn can open up new opportunities.
In the interim while waiting you may want to try Freelancing or Part-time Work. These can provide valuable experience and income while you continue your search for a full-time position. Volunteering can also help you gain new skills, build your network, and potentially lead to job opportunities.
Sometimes, what makes the job hunting process tedious are the uncomfortable emotions we experience. To manage these feelings and avoid burnout, try the following:
Set Realistic Goals: Set small, achievable goals for your job search each day to avoid feeling overwhelmed. For example, aim to apply to a certain number of jobs per week or dedicate a set amount of time to networking. Afterward, engage in activities that bring you joy in a healthy way, such as watching a comedy reel, or learning a new skill like cooking a meal.
Take Breaks: It’s important to take regular breaks to recharge. Engage in activities you enjoy and spend time with friends and family to maintain a healthy balance.
Practice Self-care & Self-compassion: Engage in regular exercise, maintain a healthy diet, and ensure you get sufficient sleep to improve your mood and energy levels. Additionally, practice being kind to yourself and recognise the importance of self-compassion during this challenging time. Each day, take a few moments to write down three things you appreciate about yourself or three things you did well. This simple exercise can help shift your focus towards self-compassion and reinforce positive self-esteem.
Acknowledge Your Achievements: Keep a record of your accomplishments and positive feedback from previous roles or projects. Remind yourself of your strengths and successes.
Positive Self-talk: Challenge negative thoughts by replacing them with positive affirmations. Remember that everyone faces rejection and setbacks in their career journey.
Focus on Growth: View each interview and application as a learning experience. Each step, whether successful or not, brings you closer to finding the right position.
Sometimes job hunting is like a marathon, not a sprint. It’s normal to feel discouraged at times, but persistence and a proactive approach will eventually lead to success. Be kind to yourself during this process. I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!
Best of luck with your job search!

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your experience with us. It is very hurtful when we are blamed for something we didn’t do, and it hurts even more when a friend contributes to that hurt. I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. It’s understandable to feel hurt and mistrustful after being unfairly blamed, especially by a friend.
In this sense, your body is doing the right thing by withdrawing to protect you from similar hurt. However, withdrawing may not be a helpful strategy in the long run. While it might temporarily numb the pain, it can also prevent you from enjoying good-quality friendships in the future.
Instead of falling into the “all or nothing” thinking trap—where you either trust fully or don’t trust at all—consider finding a middle ground. Allow trust to be built gradually over time. Learn from this experience as valuable feedback and use it to improve how you navigate friendships and trust.
Here are a few thoughts that might help:
2. Acknowledge Your Feelings: It’s important to recognise that your feelings of hurt, mistrust, and stress are valid. You’ve been through a difficult experience, and it’s natural to feel overwhelmed. Practice self-compassion and kindness to yourself.
3. Reflect on the Incident: Sometimes, looking back at what happened can help you understand your feelings better. Consider writing in a journal to explore this further. Here are some prompts to get you started:
Describe the incident where my friend blamed me for cheating. What exactly happened? How did I feel during and after the event?
What emotions did I feel when my friend blamed me for cheating? How have these emotions influenced my ability to trust others? How have they affected my relationships with other friends? You may want to use a feelings wheel to help you name all the emotions.
What lessons have I learned from the experience of being blamed for cheating? How can these lessons help me in future relationships? What can I do differently to protect myself while still being open to trusting others?
4. Describe the incident where my friend blamed me for cheating. What exactly happened? How did I feel during and after the event?
5. What emotions did I feel when my friend blamed me for cheating? How have these emotions influenced my ability to trust others? How have they affected my relationships with other friends? You may want to use a feelings wheel to help you name all the emotions.
6. What lessons have I learned from the experience of being blamed for cheating? How can these lessons help me in future relationships? What can I do differently to protect myself while still being open to trusting others?
7. Take Small Steps Towards Trust: It’s okay to take your time in trusting people again. Start with small acts of trust with those you feel comfortable with. Trust is built over time, and it’s perfectly fine to be cautious. Here are two actionable steps to help:
Start with Low-Stakes Situations: Engage in small, low-risk interactions where you can practice trust without feeling too vulnerable. For example, you could ask a classmate to share notes or a friend to help with a simple task. These situations can help you build confidence in trusting others gradually.
Set Boundaries and Communicate: Clearly communicate your boundaries and expectations in relationships. Let people know what you need to feel comfortable and secure. This could be as simple as telling a friend, “I prefer to keep our plans flexible,” or “I need some time to open up about personal things.” Setting boundaries helps you feel more in control and safe, making it easier to trust others over time.

10. Communicate: If you feel comfortable, talk to your current friends about your feelings. Let them know why you might be a bit guarded. Good friends will understand and support you.
11. Self-Care: Make sure you’re taking care of yourself. Engage in activities that you enjoy and that help you relax. This can help reduce stress and make you feel more balanced.
12. Seek Support: Sometimes, talking to a counsellor or a trusted adult can provide additional support. They can offer strategies to cope with stress and rebuild trust.
13. Focus on Positive Relationships: Spend time with the friends who make you feel good and valued. Positive interactions can slowly help rebuild your trust in others.

It’s okay to have a small circle of friends. Quality is more important than quantity. As they say sometimes some people are like elevators: they lift us up, and some bring us down. We get to choose wisely who we will ride with and sometimes we need to let some people off the elevator to make room for new people to come in.

Thank you for explaining further and correcting my misunderstandings. I appreciate the chance to learn from your feedback. I’m sorry to hear about the disappointment you’ve experienced. Feeling disappointed when others don’t meet our expectations is understandable, especially when we hold ourselves to similar standards of kindness and consideration.
It’s natural to want more meaningful connections and support from our friendships. It sounds like you’re reflecting on what you truly value in relationships and recognising that your previous circle of friends may not have fulfilled those needs. However, it’s also understandable to feel apprehensive about trusting new people, especially when past experiences have left you feeling let down.
While we can’t control other people’s actions, we have power over our own reactions and the choices we make. Here are three small actionable steps you can consider:
2. Set Boundaries: Clearly define what you’re comfortable with in relationships and communicate these boundaries to others. This can help protect your well-being and ensure that your needs are respected.
3. Practice Acceptance: Cultivate acceptance of both yourself and others, recognising that everyone has their own journey and perspective. This can help alleviate disappointment and foster understanding in your interactions.
4. Use Clarifying Questions: When navigating relationships, ask clarifying questions to better understand others’ intentions and motivations. This can help build trust and clarity, guiding you towards healthier connections.
Trust that by making conscious choices aligned with your values, you’ll attract the connections that genuinely uplift and support you. Thanks for being open to these suggestions and giving them a try. Your willingness to explore and grow is commendable, and we’re here to support you if you need a listening ear.

Thank you for your courage in sharing your experiences with us. Embracing vulnerability is a commendable feat, and reaching out for support demonstrates strength and resilience. You’re moving in the right direction, and I applaud your bravery.
It’s understandable to feel frustrated and discouraged when you experience reactions from others that draw attention to your appearance. Losing your hair at a young age can be a challenging experience, especially when it leads to unwanted attention and discomfort in social situations. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and give yourself permission to feel upset at times. Feeling upset is a healthy and natural response. However, if you find yourself consistently upset to the point where it impacts your quality of life, seeking professional assistance to help you cope is strongly encouraged. Taking proactive steps towards your well-being is a sign of strength and self-care.
Remember, your worth and value extend far beyond your appearance. You are a multifaceted individual, and your intrinsic worth cannot be confined to societal standards of beauty. I hope you will resonate with this quote that I came across once (author unknown) that ‘Strength isn’t about having a full head of hair; it’s about finding beauty and confidence in every strand of your soul.’
It’s okay to have days when you feel down or overwhelmed by the reactions of others. Allow yourself to feel those emotions, but also remind yourself of your inner strength and resilience.
Here are some actionable steps you can take:
2. Practice Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself and recognise that it’s okay to feel frustrated or upset about the reactions you receive. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend in a similar situation.
3. Focus on What You Can Control: Redirect your attention towards actions and thoughts that empower you. Engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfilment, surround yourself with supportive people who uplift you, and practice self-care to nurture your overall well-being.
4. Educate Others: Consider educating others about alopecia or the reasons behind your hair loss. By sharing information about your condition or experience, you can help increase awareness and empathy in your community.

I am self blaming myself for an impuse purchase that I made outside from my financial means. I mean is normal to made an impulse purchase, but this package is too expensive with my current financial circumstance. I mean i do feel a need for this product but at the same time i feel that I could have used a cheaper mean instead of purchasing this package… i am also blaming myself for being and feeling weak in front of sales tactic when I obviously know is sales tactic and promotion especially when I was so ready to actually reject and SAY NO to any sorts of packages and promotions when I went for my first trial. So i am like unable to sleep cuz i keep thinking about this big purchase i have made… Is there any ways for me to overcome this regret and this thought (except like asking me to work) and how not to make the same mistake…
And additionally i would need help in understanding how do i relieve my regrets cuz i have too many regrets in life be it regrets from long ago or recent like my package issue and i hang upon it. I know the concept of self-compassion is hard to perform it on myself Is there a way to deal with all these?",,0,,,,,

That sounds really challenging! Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and feelings with us. It takes courage to be open. Well done for seeking support and being open to new perspectives. This is a positive step in the right direction.
Before I share some strategies, may I suggest considering asking for a refund. Most expensive purchases, especially packages usually have a cooling-off period. It might be worthwhile to ask for a refund. If you feel that the sales tactics were too pressurising, you may also want to report the incident to CASE .
Regret plays an important role in our well-being by serving as an adaptive function that helps us learn from our experiences and improve future decision-making. However, it can also become maladaptive if it overwhelms us and prevents us from moving forward.
Regrets are supposed to help us by allowing us to:
Learn from Mistakes: Regret helps us reflect on our actions and understand what went wrong. This reflection can guide us to make better choices in the future. For example, if you regret not preparing for a test and receive a low grade, you might be more motivated to study harder next time.
Motivation for Change: Feeling regret can push us to change our behaviour. If you regret spending too much money on impulse purchases, you might start budgeting more carefully.
Building Empathy: Regret can also make us more empathetic. If we regret hurting someone’s feelings, we become more aware of how our actions affect others and might strive to be kinder and more considerate in the future.
However, when we struggle to regulate our emotions or lack a strong sense of connection with others, regret can become harmful by causing us to:
Ruminate: When regret leads to constant rumination—repeatedly thinking about past mistakes—it can become harmful. This can make us feel stuck and prevent us from enjoying the present or planning for the future.
Lowered Self-Esteem: Excessive regret can damage our self-esteem. Constantly focusing on our mistakes can make us feel like we’re not good enough or incapable of making good decisions.
Anxiety and Depression: Persistent regret can contribute to anxiety and depression. The constant negative thoughts and self-criticism can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
Sounds like perhaps in your situation regret has become maladaptive. To make regret work for us rather than against us, it’s important to balance it. This can be done by:
Practicing Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself when you make mistakes. Remember that everyone makes errors and that it’s part of being human. Here are 3 actionable steps to start with:
2. Mindful Self-Awareness: At the end of the day, take five minutes to sit quietly and reflect on your feelings. If you notice you’re feeling sad or frustrated, acknowledge these emotions without judging yourself for having them. Simply observe your thoughts and feelings, perhaps saying to yourself, “I feel sad right now, and that’s okay.”
3. Self-Kindness: If you make a mistake, instead of telling yourself, “I’m so stupid for messing this up,” try saying, “It’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone does. I’ll learn from this and do better next time.” Write a supportive note to yourself or repeat kind words in your mind.
4. Common Humanity: When you feel isolated in your struggles, remind yourself that others have experienced similar challenges. For instance, if you’re feeling overwhelmed by a project, think about how many people also struggle with big tasks. Tell yourself, “I’m not alone in this. Many people find big projects challenging, and it’s okay to ask for help.”
Developing self-compassion takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself as you work on building this important life skill.
Growth Mindset: Focus on what you can learn from the regretful experience rather than just the negative feelings. Use it as a tool for personal growth.
- Change “I Can’t” to “I Can’t Yet”: Whenever you face a challenge or encounter something new, replace “I can’t” with “I can’t yet.” This simple shift in language reminds you that your abilities can improve over time with effort and practice.
- Celebrate Effort, Not Just Results: Instead of solely focusing on the outcome, celebrate the effort you put into your tasks. Whether you succeed or face setbacks, recognise and appreciate the hard work you’ve invested. This helps reinforce the idea that effort leads to growth, regardless of the immediate outcome.
4. Move Forward: After reflecting on your regret and learning from it, let it go. Focus on making positive changes and setting goals for the future.
Sure! Here are two simple actionable steps for letting things go:
- Practice Mindfulness: When you find yourself holding onto negative thoughts or emotions, take a moment to practice mindfulness. This can be as simple as focusing on your breath for a few minutes or paying attention to the present moment without judgment. Mindfulness helps you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, allowing you to acknowledge them without getting caught up in them.
- Write it Down and Let it Out: If something is bothering you, try writing about it in a journal or on a piece of paper. Expressing your thoughts and feelings on paper can help you gain clarity and perspective. Once you’ve written it down, you can choose to keep it or let it go by tearing up or shredding the paper. This physical act can symbolise releasing the uncomfortable emotions and moving forward.
By developing an understanding of and effectively managing regret, we can harness its potential to enhance our well-being and prevent it from perpetuating distress. These strategies serve as a starting point for you. It’s common to encounter resistance and difficulty when implementing these approaches independently. I encourage you to consider seeking support from a counsellor who can provide personalised guidance and assistance in creating a support plan that aligns with your comfort level.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Thank you for including a trigger warning in your message; it’s very considerate of you. This shows your thoughtfulness and kindness. I’m glad you reached out for support on this platform instead of trying to cope alone. Well done!
If you feel comfortable, could you share what has prevented you from seeing your therapist for such a long time? When was your last therapy session?
Dealing with medication side effects sounds very challenging, and I’m really sorry you’re going through this. It’s important to take your feelings seriously and seek help when needed. Here are a few steps that might help you navigate this difficult period.
Reach Out to a Trusted Adult: Even if you can’t see your therapist, try talking to a parent, guardian, or another trusted adult about how you’re feeling. They can provide support and help you get in touch with the right professionals.
Get mental health support: It might be worth reaching out to another mental health professional to explain your current situation. If you’re not satisfied with their advice, you can ask for a second opinion or a referral to another psychiatrist.
**Explore Other Support Services: If getting in contact with your therapist again isn’t possible, perhaps try another therapist. There are also crisis hotlines, mental health organisations, and online communities that can offer immediate support and guidance.
Here are some community options you can consider:
Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH): 1800-283 7019
TOUCHLINE: 1800-377-2252
Care Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353 5800

Medication Management: It’s important not to stop or adjust your medication without professional guidance, as this can lead to withdrawal symptoms and other complications. Discuss any changes in medication with a healthcare provider.
Self-Care Strategies: Focus on basic self-care. Eating regularly, staying hydrated, getting enough rest, and engaging in gentle activities that you enjoy can make a difference. Mindfulness or relaxation techniques might also help manage some of the stress and confusion. Here are some YouTube videos for your consideration:
Box Breathing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7uQXDkxEtM
Progressive Muscle Relaxation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4gJuAyPxUk
Managing Feelings & Emotions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-MyQgfH3A
Emergency Support: If you’re feeling overwhelmed or having serious suicidal thoughts, please seek immediate help. Go to the nearest hospital or call emergency services. You can also reach out to SOS – 1767 the hotline for SOS is toll-free and you may choose to remain anonymous.
You will be speaking to volunteers who are trained to provide emotional support and a listening ear or receive some resources for professional support. You may also consider reaching out to SOS via their CareText function using WhatsApp (9151 1767).
It’s okay to ask for help and to keep looking until you find the right support for yourself. Your safety is the top priority. You don’t have to manage all of your challenges alone.

Thank you for being so courageous in sharing such intense feelings with us here on this platform. I am glad that you are reaching out and I really hope we can be of support to you.
Firstly, I am sorry you are feeling this way and having the mental breakdowns which you do not seem to have control of. I wonder how long have you been feeling this way and how have you been coping so far.
It sounds like you are viewing yourself rather negatively and I am not sure what caused you to feel this way about yourself. You sound like a nice person who is always trying to help people and bring them happiness. I am sure people around you are grateful to have you in their life, they might not say it but they are around you for a reason. You may have many strengths that you are not aware of as you don’t affirm yourself enough. I hope you can take some time to think about your strengths and achievements so far, to encourage yourself.
Also, it sounds concerning that you are having thoughts to end your life. It sounds like life have been difficult and tiring for you. And I want to commend you for surviving so far even though it is tough! As you talk about living for someone, I wonder if that person can be a safe person for you to share your struggles with. If he can trust and appreciate that you will always be there for him, perhaps he would want to be of similar support to you.
If you find it challenging to talk to your family or others directly or if you need additional support, you may also consider reaching out to a mental health professional like a counsellor or online platforms. They can provide a safe space for you to explore healthy ways to work around your emotions.
Here are some platforms you can consider:
2. SOS – 1767 the hotline for SOS is toll-free and you may choose to remain anonymous.

Do know that it takes a lot of courage and resilience to survive through the challenges and even maintaining a job. Please don’t deny yourself of these achievements, and affirm yourself more. Here are some suggestions for you to consider when you are feeling sad and discouraged:
2. Self-care. It can be eating and sleeping well. Having a balanced diet and being well-rested contributes to regulating mood and improving cognitive function. Take some time to engage in activities you enjoy or find ways to be good to yourself because you deserve to be treated well.
3. Positive self-talk: It is important how you speak to yourself. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself. You are strong and you have survived through many obstacles in your life. Be kind to yourself as you process your feelings.
4. Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
5. Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.
You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).

My gf and her father are on very bad terms. Recently, he contacted me and told me about something my gf did that was overboard and tldr he does not ever want to be associated with her (and by extension, including me) so no contact at all.
I can see why he would think that my gf went overboard, but i can also see from the perspective of my gf that it was more of ignorance and overlooking because of an in-the-moment negative emotional state.
I just am so lost over this situation because it has scaled to something that is extreme to the point of complete cut off. I love my gf and i strongly believe in marriage being the union of both individuals and their families. Hence, it is hard to foresee a future and this is eating at me and causing me anxiety. I cannot stop thinking about this and this is such an uncertain situation. It is uncomfortable and I am yearning some semblance of control over this situation.
I am looking for advice as to what my next step should be. I am not considering running away from this situation but i want to solve it (or at least deescalate and ride out the emotions). What should my next step be? How should I act? How do i resolve this entire situation in an amicable way?",,0,,,,,

Thank you for coming here to share your struggles with us. From your sharing, it sounds like you have good self-awareness and know what you want for yourself. Feels like you have been a person with control in life and this situation is making you feel a little lost as you don’t seem to have much control.
It is helpful to know that every family has their own culture and own ways of doing things.
I see that you have a good sense of how a healthy family relationship looks like, and I really appreciate that you are trying your best to help your girlfriend build a relationship with her father.
Perhaps, you can have a conversation with her about your concerns and hear from her perspective on how she would like to be supported. Even if her decision does not align with your beliefs, it is important to validate her feelings and not impose too much on her decision or control their family dynamics.
If this relationship is important to you, standing by her and supporting her in how she would like to be supported might be helpful. Also, do give her some time to reflect on her current situation. Perhaps, as time goes by, she might be able to find a compromise that works well for you and her.
I think that you are a very good person and that her father respects you as well. Thus, telling you of his decision and reasons for doing so. Do give both of them some time as they could be still processing this on their own. You can also try to find out more from your girlfriend about how the family used to resolve their issues in the past. Maybe taking a break from each other is their way of managing conflicts.
I hope this is helpful and that things get better for you and your girlfriend.",,0,,18987,,18987.0,
12499,How do i improve myself,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/how-do-i-improve-myself/12499,Seeking Help,---,10273,g37,User,,18988,1,"i think i’ve become a terrible person and i don’t deserve to have my life. last year i was extremely down because i had a very hard time talking to people and making friends. i felt so lonely that i started to shut people out of my life but i had one friend who i gathered enough courage to confess how i’d been feeling. to this day he’s the only person who knows how i felt.
he provided me comfort and warmth and almost made me cry in public, but he still manages to make me feel bad about myself. i think it’s my fault i get hurt though, because whenever we hung out he’d make a small little joke about my weight or just my looks in general and it’s made me cry countless times. there was this instance where he even joked about my smile, and at the time i hadn’t even questioned whether i looked ugly while smiling, but now i just can’t help but feel disgusted whenever i catch myself grinning over something.
and usually i wouldn’t let small comments like this get to me, but i’ve grown fond of him this past year. from the moment we talked, i had already started feeling butterflies in my stomach. i think it’s been affecting how harshly i take his words and actions, because he’s not the type to text alot and texts me rather dryly, and even while knowing this, i’ll get really sad and frustrated the whole day. it feels like if i don’t get his attention my whole day is ruined, and i know this. i know how badly my dependence on him has gotten but i don’t know how to stop or what to do. it’s been making me act out and take my frustration out on everyone around me, especially him. i know it’s my fault that i’m distressed, but i still put the blame on him because he won’t act the way i want him to.
he’s had a troubling past as well and wasn’t very well-liked in primary school so he’s always struggled having friends. he told me i was one of his first close friends and that he doesn’t understand why i still hang out with him. i know this and try treating him the best way i can but sometimes i just get so hurt by his remarks, or other things that he does, and i just push him away. i ignore him at school, online, or just whatever, and make him feel lonely. and i always see this as me making him feel how i’ve been feeling but i know it’s wrong and hurtful and i’m a total ■■■, but the cycle keeps repeating. he never apologises for saying stuff like that to me, and i never apologise for leaving him out.
i think it’s gotten worse cause earlier this week we had a small group competition, and i was so happy to be with this group of girls, because i was finally making more friends. but during recess, just before the activity, i felt so angry cause i was trying to enjoy my break silently but he just butt in and sat in front of me. he was speaking incredibly loudly while there was this group of friends nearby SURROUNDING my desk. and keep in mind he’s kind of hated in class. i have a hard time socially and sometimes he makes me feel embarrassed to be his friend. it’s terrible, i know i shouldn’t care, but i’ve always dreamt of that ideal school life with a small group of friends who are funny and well-liked, and he’s not really that.
but anyways i got so ashamed because of him and i ignored him the rest of the day, and the day after that. since yesterday was a holiday i ignored him as well, and i was so scared to deal with the whole situation cause i knew i was being disgusting that i begged my parents to let me skip. i am now ignoring all of my friends but it doesn’t matter anyways cause like only one person asked me if i was okay since i never came to school.
i dont know how to improve myself though, im scared to ask my friends for advice cause their lives are way worse than mine and they don’t need to be troubled with my small angsty problems. i just really wanna know how to stop hurting the people i care for and feel like i deserve my life.",,0,,,,,

Thanks for being so brave to share your struggles here with us. It sounds like you have been going through a tough time in school and also feeling somewhat stuck in this situation.
I do want to tell you that you are not a bad person for having such feelings. It is normal to feel this way because it doesn’t sound like you have a healthy friendship with this friend.
There are times when his words made you feel bad about yourself and it is not helpful to keep hearing these comments. I wonder if you have told him about it before, like how you feel and how his words affected you.
Also, I think you need to believe that you deserve your life and deserve to have things going your way. No one else should be in control of your life or make you feel bad for things that you feel happy about. Believe in yourself more and give yourself the power and control of your life.
Perhaps, now is a good time for you to re-evaluate this friendship. Would you want to continue or distance yourself from him. If you want to continue this friendship, I would suggest for you to have a talk with him and let him know how affected you are by his words. If you would like to have a break, maybe it is also helpful to let him know instead of ghosting him. By ignoring him, you might feel bad about your actions due to the lack of closure for both of you. At the end of the day, it is about finding a solution to ensure that things are fair between you and him.
Also, self-compassion is something you can consider working on. It sounds like you can be rather critical of yourself and it will not help you in improving your confidence. Be kind to yourself as you evaluate this situation and try not to blame yourself too much for it. I think you have been trying your best to manage this situation and do affirm yourself for that.

Thanks for coming here to share your struggles with us. I think it takes a lot of strength and courage to reach out and talk about how you are feeling. Do know that your feelings are valid and important to voice out!
It sounds like you have been struggling for some time already and it seems you are concerned about telling others as you are worried about how people think of you and somehow their opinions of you are important. I wonder if it means that these people are close and important to you, thus you feel worried how they might respond when you share your feelings with them. If they really are important to you, I am sure you are important to them as well. Which means they would likely want to support you if you do reach out to them. That is what relationships and friendships are supposed to be like. You would support each other when there is a need.
From your sharing, it seems like you are tired of things that are happening in your life but you still are motivated to push forward. It could be your goals, loved ones or other things; do know that these are your protective factors (they keep you from hurting yourself) and it is important to be more connected with them when you are in need of support.
If you are comfortable, do share more details with us. Like what is causing you worries and all these frustrations? Sometimes talking about your worries can help you gain new insights and perspectives. If you have been keeping them to yourself, you might experience a downward spiral in your mental state. I hope you know that you are not alone and there is support available.
If you find it challenging to talk to your family or others directly or if you need additional support, you may also consider reaching out to a mental health professional like a school counsellor or online platforms. They can provide a safe space for you to explore healthy ways to work around your emotions. Here are some platforms you can consider:

those headaches sounds really horrible sometimes having headaches can really make it so difficult to go through a day properly >< so its reasonable why you may be struggling hard!
some small things i realise help with headaches are like drinking sufficient water (aka at least 2 litres a day, dehydration is such a problem that most ppl arent aware of, especially with the hot hot weather these days). or giving yourself head massages, or putting your feet in hot water to divert blood to your feet away from your head, thus making the headache less intense. hopefully these makes the physical symptom of headache better!!
as for feeling overwhelmed and tired, im guessing its a lot more complex >< can share more abt your specific concerns then we can see if can help give you some perspectives!
just know that there is no judgment here, and you are precious and valuable

I don’t have much problem with life, have great circle of friend, have a job and a harmony family.
But since years ago I think something is wrong with me when I started my first job, I tend to cry without any reason and I started to have thought of dying almost everyday. I tend to have thought like “how good if I die tomorrow”
I don’t know if it’s normal for people to have “dying thoughts” but I’ve been having it from times to times, when things doesn’t go so well. Sometimes I think maybe my level of handling stress is low so these negative thoughts happens.
But those negative thoughts gone for about 1-2 years, and lately it came back from time to time whenever my feel lost in life.
I couldn’t find a reason or a “target” of living, or why should I work hard. I have a bad habit of doing self harm when I couldn’t cope with my negative thoughts, and doing it helps to calm me when I can only feel the pain of doing it.
I don’t talk about these negative stuffs with people around me, afraid to be a “burden” to them and I think most importantly making them “disappointed” on not being a “happy person” anymore.
Is it normal for people to have “suicidal thoughts” ? Because I think everyone will have suicidal thoughts from time to time.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for reaching out to us on this platform and sharing your concerns. I think it take a lot of strength and courage for you to talk about such strong feelings. I hope you know that your feelings are valid and that you are not alone in this, I am sure there are people who love and care deeply for you and know that it is okay to ask for help.
Feeling overwhelmed when transiting to work from school can be rather stressful as you go through a lot of changes in dynamics with people, environment and routine. Please acknowledge your effort and know that you are doing the best you can to adapt.
Sometimes going through such changes in life, can feel confusing and disorienting. Perhaps you can also take some time to revisit your goals as it sound like you are feeling a little lost in life. It is helpful to reassess goals periodically to ensure that they are aligned with your current situation and circumstances. Given that you are feeling discouraged at this point, think about what else you can do under such circumstances to make your life feel fulfilled and meaningful.
I would like you to also think about your strengths and what have kept you going thus far. I believe you have lots of other qualities and abilities; and that makes you whole as a person. I am sure people around you like you as who you are, not just your positive side.
Everyone faces challenges in life and it is about knowing when to seek support and who
you can go to for support.
I am also concerned about you hurting yourself as a way of coping. While it could provide a sense of calmness in that moment, it is not a long-term solution. I am sure people around you would care about you and not want to see you hurting yourself. Let’s try to explore some ways you can cope with, that are helpful and not hurtful to yourself. Here are some alternate suggestions for you to consider trying:
2. Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
3. Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.
You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).
4. Fidget toys – It can be something to keep your hands occupied and to provide sensory stimulation without causing hurt to yourself.
5. Physical activity – It can be to walk around, jump a little, anything to release any pent-up energy within yourself.
6. Identify your triggers. Think about what triggers and distracts you. What is the primary issue that is causing you to feel upset. Reflect on your past experiences. Were there situations when you felt triggered, what contributed to those feelings and how you coped with it then.
7. Journaling. Track your reactions when you feel strong emotions or engage in certain behaviours. What was going on at that time, note your thoughts and emotions. Writing these down could help allow you to reflect on them more deeply. This can possibly help you gain insight or new perspectives to the situation.
8. Self-care. Eat and sleep well. Having a balanced diet and being well-rested contributes to regulating mood and improving cognitive function. Take some time to engage in activities you enjoy.
9. Positive self-talk. It is important how you speak to yourself. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself.
10. Seek support. Do reach out to trusted family or friends to talk about how you are feeling. Talking through experiences helps to gain new perspectives and insights. It could be encouraging as well.
If you find it challenging to talk to your family or others directly or if you need additional support, you may also consider reaching out to a mental health professional like a counsellor or online platforms. They can provide a safe space for you to explore healthy ways to work around your emotions. Here are some platforms you can consider:
2. SOS – 1767 the hotline for SOS is toll-free and you may choose to remain anonymous. You will be speaking to volunteers who are trained to provide emotional support and a listening ear or receive some resources for professional support. You may also consider reaching out to SOS via their CareText function using WhatsApp (9151 1767).

From your sharing, it sounds like you are looking at yourself in a negative light and that will further discourage you. I see that you are still seeking different ways to cope with your difficulties, and you have not given up even though it has been really challenging. I think this is something you really need to affirm yourself for.
I’d like to end off by thanking you again for your courage in sharing. Please know that you are not alone, and that there is hope for healing as long as you don’t give up on yourself. You’ve come a long way and we are here to support you.

12359,Do I have ADHD ?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/do-i-have-adhd/12359,Signs and Symptoms,---,10227,Onishizhu,User,,18564,1,"Hi I am a 20(F) year old young adult and basically I’m here to check if I have ADHD or am I an ultimate procrastinator. Basically I have been surviving well in school all the way until when I was in polytechnic where by I have to be self discipline and plan my own time table for the different commitments I have. I became really bad at coping my life through polytechnics as i am really bad at taking notes of the tiny details or keeping up with the latest updates of lectures and quizzes as this information might not be informed in class. I also couldn’t find motivation to start doing stuff even though I know it has to be done and would be anxious over (sometimes even in the middle of the night ) it but I needed the dopamine and adrenaline to drive me to do stuff. This adrenaline comes in really random timing and it’s like a small gust of energy to keep me really focus for that hour. It’s really extreme cause it’s either I don’t do anything or I try to do everything. I also became very jumpy in my thoughts and like I could change conversion topics multiple times in a span of maybe 5 minutes. Basically having a really short attention span.( I am really very easily distracted too ) I really don’t know if this is just my shitty ■■■ personality or is my ADHD working up. I went to look up online and some symptoms were really vague so I’m not too sure and getting diagnosed is really expensive. Öuhh and also to mention I have bad sleeping habits, a lot of times I feel like I’m too awake to sleep. I dream all the time and I remember my dreams majority of the times, this dreams can be crazy. Sometimes I will fall into this sleeping paralysis thing where by I’m awake in my dream in the exact same room, outfit and position that I was in but I’m actually not awake. I dream so much sometimes that I could messed up with the reality too. I hope the person reading this can give me some advice cause I really needed an answer if I am just pure lazy or I should do something about it. Thank you !",,1,,,,,

It’s clear you’re dealing with a lot, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. It sounds like you’re trying different strategies to manage stress and stay on task, which is a positive step.
Given your experience with anxiety and challenges with focus, would it be helpful to explore more structured techniques to manage your tasks and anxiety?
For instance, some people find writing down their to-do lists and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps can help. Have you tried using tools like planners or apps for scheduling and reminders?",,0,,,,,

It sounds like you’re facing significant challenges. Firstly, thank you for reaching out to us here. Coping with difficulties related to self-regulation and executive functioning skills can be quite daunting, and I appreciate your courage in sharing your experiences. I also want to recognise your resilience in handling these emotions over time. It takes strength to confront such feelings, and your willingness to seek support and reflect on your thoughts is commendable. Well done, for taking this step towards seeking support!
It’s understandable to feel confused and overwhelmed by these challenges, especially when they impact various aspects of your life, including your academic performance and daily routines.
From what you’ve described, there are several characteristics that could potentially be associated with ADHD, such as difficulty with organisation, short attention span, impulsivity, and inconsistent motivation levels. However, it’s important to note that ADHD symptoms can overlap with other conditions or be influenced by external factors like stress and sleep habits.
While online research can provide some insights, it’s often not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis. If you’re concerned about ADHD, it might be helpful to consult a mental health professional or a healthcare provider who specialises in ADHD assessment and diagnosis. They can conduct a comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed history of your symptoms, behavioral observations, and possibly psychological testing, to determine if ADHD or another condition may be contributing to your experiences. You may want to approach CHAT or get a refferal from a polyclinic doctor to see if you can receive an assessment at a subsidised rate.
ADHD treatment involves more than just medication; a bigger aspect of it involves acquiring executive functioning skills and discovering adaptive methods to leverage your unique strengths for optimal performance. If undergoing an assessment isn’t something you’re keen on right now, that’s absolutely fine. You can take charge of your learning journey by exploring executive functioning skills and nurturing their development.
Here are some suggestions for your consideration:
2. Establish a Routine: Create a structured daily routine that includes specific times for tasks such as studying, work, meals, exercise, and relaxation. Consistency can help in managing time effectively and reducing procrastination.
3. Break Tasks into Smaller Steps: Break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This can make tasks feel less overwhelming and help maintain focus and motivation.
4. Use Organisational Tools: Utilise tools such as planners, calendars, to-do lists, and digital apps to keep track of tasks, deadlines, appointments, and important information. Set reminders and alarms as needed.
5. Minimize Distractions: Identify and minimize distractions in your environment, such as noise, clutter, or digital distractions (e.g., notifications, social media).
6. Practice Time Management: Use techniques like time blocking, Pomodoro Technique (work for a focused period, then take a short break), and prioritisation to manage time effectively and allocate sufficient time for tasks.
7. Breaks and Movement: Take regular breaks during tasks to prevent mental fatigue and maintain focus. Incorporate physical activity into your routine, as exercise can help improve concentration, mood, and overall well-being.
8. Mindfulness and Relaxation: Practice mindfulness techniques, deep breathing exercises, or relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation to reduce stress, improve focus, and enhance self-awareness.
9. Healthy Lifestyle: Maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle by prioritising regular sleep, nutritious meals, hydration, and adequate physical activity. A healthy lifestyle can support overall well-being and cognitive function.
10. Growth Mindset: Adopt a growth mindset, give yourself permission to make mistakes and learn from them. Your value and self-esteem are not tied solely to your achievements. You have inherent worth and can continually evolve and refine yourself.
11. Seek Support: Open up about your challenges to trusted family members, friends, teachers, or your school counsellor. Seeking support can lead to discovering effective coping strategies tailored to your needs, as others may offer valuable insights and guidance.
The life skills mentioned above are strategies that can be helpful for everyone whether they have ADHD or not. At 20years old, please give yourself grace and self compassion. You don’t have to have everything figured out. Remember, learning executive functioning skills is a journey, and it’s okay to seek support and try different approaches until you find what works best for you. Celebrate your progress and accomplishments along the way, and be kind to yourself as you navigate challenges.
Regarding your sleeping habits and vivid dreams, these can also be influenced by various factors such as stress, anxiety, and sleep hygiene practices. It might be beneficial to explore techniques for improving sleep quality, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and minimising screen time before bed.

12408,No idea what to do,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/no-idea-what-to-do/12408,Seeking Help,---,10247,CaptainJurong,User,,18731,1,"I was retrenched in January 2024, and I got my current job as soon as I heard of my retrenchment because - who would want to go out of job and have no income for an unpredictable period right?
My current job was my third, and I took it because it was the only company out of the many offers who gave me a senior position instead of an associate one. And why does it matter? Because I missed out on two confirmed promotions in my previous two firms. First company had a new management who let me go while I was on long-term medical leave on the pretext of restructuring; second company got bought over and my whole team was made redundant. For both cases, the letting go happened on the month of my promotion.
But I realise that I couldn’t cope with my current work, even though it’s of a similar nature to my first job which I have close to 3 years of accumulated experience. I was overwhelmed with the fact that there were so many new things which I had never encountered prior, yet as a senior I have to guide my juniors in their daily work too. The extra pressure comes from the fact that within my team of 10, two new senior hires who also joined in early 2024 failed their probation.
The last two months were tough for me at work, because I realised I couldn’t really concentrate well and am easily distracted (e.g. I could be looking at this document, and then before I realised it, I had blanked out or got brain fogging and have no idea what I was doing prior, or why did I even open up this document in the first place). Outside of work, I started losing interests in my hobbies, not wanting to interact with anyone else, and just felt lethargic constantly, like refusing to get out of bed in the daytime and just wanting to head back to sleep even though I have slept for 10 over hours.
If you may ask why I didn’t talk to my managers or boss about it, the reason is because I am still in probationary period. And talking to them about my current situation MAY result in me not passing my probation, especially with the knowledge that two new senior hires failed theirs.
I thought of submitting my resignation, but the thought of not being able to get a job I wanted (which is a similar nature to my second job), restarting my career as an associate for a 30 year old guy, and having no income for months potentially will create more anxiety for myself. But on another hand, I feel I would be worse off mental-wise if I continue to stay.
As confused as I am feeling now, what should I do? Am I burnt-out, having anxiety or depression?",,1,,,,,
12408,No idea what to do,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/no-idea-what-to-do/12408,Seeking Help,---,7296,CoolBreeze,Professional,Professional,18744,2,"Dear @CaptainJurong,
Your situation sounds incredibly challenging, and it’s completely valid to feel the way you do. It’s tough navigating such big changes and pressures all at once. It must be incredibly frustrating to deal with such setbacks, especially when you’ve worked so hard to advance in your career. Thank you for opening up and seeking support. It’s a crucial step towards finding possible solutions and taking better care of yourself. Well done
From your sharing, I sense that you have many strengths. Your resilience in facing multiple setbacks and still pushing forward to secure a new position is truly admirable. Your determination to find a new job so quickly after retrenchment shows a strong drive to maintain stability and progress in your career. Your ability to recognise how your current job is affecting your mental health and considering seeking help demonstrates a level of self-awareness. It’s also impressive how you’ve managed to guide your juniors despite feeling overwhelmed yourself. The way you continue to strive for improvement and balance in your life speaks volumes about your character and perseverance. I hope you’ll join me in taking a moment to appreciate these strengths and celebrate your wins, even though things don’t feel okay at the moment.
While it feels like you are caught in a tough spot, I hope you’ll consider the following perspectives. Hopefully, this will help you feel like you have more breathing space and recognise that you have options.
Feeling overwhelmed when stepping into a new senior role is quite common. Transitioning to a new company and mastering all the nuances naturally takes time—more than just a few months, especially if the role’s demands are unfamiliar. If other senior hires have faced similar challenges, it may signal areas where the company’s onboarding process or support for new team members could be enhanced. This might reflect broader issues within the company rather than any deficiency in your skills. Staying in a job that negatively impacts your mental health can lead to worsening symptoms. Balancing the need for income with your mental well-being is equally important.
Please be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you’re giving your best effort. There may also be some residual grief from suddenly leaving your past job. Adjusting to a new role often involves a learning curve that can be steeper than we’d like it to be. Give yourself permission to navigate this curve at your own pace and remember that it’s okay to take time to acclimate. Your reluctance to approach your managers is understandable, especially considering the probationary period and the experiences of other senior hires.
Engaging in dialogue with your reporting officer isn’t solely about troubleshooting; it’s also an avenue to seek guidance, feedback, and resources that can elevate your performance and alignment with their expectations. For example, you could explore specific resources or training opportunities that could enhance your effectiveness in your role and positively impact the team. Alternatively, you might discuss the objectives necessary to secure confirmation in your position. Approaching these conversations as opportunities to seek support rather than focusing solely on challenges can ensure you receive the necessary assistance without casting doubt on your competence.
If the above doesn’t seem possible with your current company then perhaps it might be worthwhile to consider looking for other job opportunities for your overall wellbeing in the long run. This could help ease your anxiety about being without income if you decide to leave your current role. Consider roles similar to your second job where you felt more confident and less stressed.
In the meantime, please do focus on incorporating small, manageable self-care activities into your routine to support your mental well-being. This can include engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, ensuring adequate sleep, and rediscovering hobbies or social activities that bring you joy.
Prioritise these activities and start with small steps, even if it’s just dedicating two minutes a day initially, then gradually increase the duration at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Celebrate your achievements by keeping a “book of wins,” where you record moments you’re proud of yourself, whether it’s as simple as showing up to work despite feeling unmotivated. The goal is to improve your self-care just by 1% a day, and by the end of the month, it will be 30%.
Consider integrating daily practices of calming breaths and grounding techniques to help regulate your nervous system and promote a sense of calm.
If you feel ready, do consider sharing your challenges with trusted friends, family members, and career mentors about your challenges. Opening up can provide you with emotional support, connection, and possibly practical advice to navigate your situation with greater ease.
Also, from the symptoms you’ve described—difficulty concentrating, feeling mentally foggy, losing interest in things you used to enjoy, withdrawing from social activities, and feeling constantly tired—it appears that your body is sending signals that your nervous system might be overwhelmed. It could be stuck in the ‘freeze’ state or rapidly shifting between fight, flight, and freeze responses, leaving little time for rest and recovery. These are natural reactions as your body tries to protect and support you in coping with the various challenges you’re facing. These symptoms also align with common signs of burnout, anxiety, or depression.
I encourage you to consider reaching out to a mental health professional to gain a clearer understanding of what you’re going through and to receive personalised guidance. They can offer insights into your experiences and recommend suitable treatments or strategies to help you manage.
Here are some self-care activities for your consideration:
4-7-8 Breathing (Relaxing Breath): This technique is known for its calming effects and can help reduce anxiety. Here’s how to practice it:
- Inhale quietly through your nose for a count of 4 seconds.
- Hold your breath for a count of 7 seconds.
- Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth for a count of 8 seconds.
- Repeat the cycle for a few rounds, maintaining a steady and relaxed pace.
Grounding Techniques: Use grounding techniques to bring your attention back to the present and reduce anxiety.
5 Senses: Focus on your senses by naming five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
Rainbow: Find 2 things of each colour in the rainbow in your surroundings.

Thank you for reaching out to us on this platform and sharing your concerns. I think it take a lot of strength and courage for you to talk about such strong feelings. I am sorry to hear that your quiz score is not what you expected, and it can be quite disheartening considering the effort you put in and how important it is to you.
Your feelings are valid and I hope you know that you are not alone in this, I am sure there are people who love and care deeply for you and it is okay to ask for help. If it feels too difficult to talk about it, sometimes sending a text message or just being with someone can help you feel better.
Life can bring us lots of challenges and I am sure you have been through difficult times as well. Overcoming challenges in life can also be a reminder that we go through different phases and this is not permanent. I know it might not feel like it right now but I want to let you know that tough times are temporary. While it seems like you are stuck and it is too difficult, they do eventually pass. Just like how you used to overcome your past challenges, remind yourself of how strong and resilient you are.
Also, do know that your academic score is not the only thing that defines who you are as a person or what you are capable of accomplishing. It does not reflect your overall abilities and potential as a person. You are definitely stronger than you think.
Let’s take small steps forward for now as it can be rather overwhelming at this moment. Focus on taking one step at a time and hopefully things will get better. I would like to suggest some coping strategies for you to consider:
2. Seek support. Do reach out to trusted family or friends who can support you emotionally, to talk about how you are feeling. Their perspective of you might be different as they see you for who you are, aside from your academic self, whereas you are currently more focused on you as a student. I hope you get a wider perspective and some encouragement from them.
3. Use resources. You may consider finding mentors, peers or lecturers who can possibly help you explore different study techniques or set a study routine. It could also be exploring study groups or scheduling review sessions with your lecturer to help with your progress.
4. Manage expectations. It is helpful to be realistic about your goals and manage your expectations around it. As a student, there are so many things you are doing besides school work and it is not possible to excel at everything. Celebrate small victories along the way to motivate yourself.
5. Self-compassion. I hope you can be kind to yourself especially during these tough periods. I see that this is very disappointing, and I hope that you are still able to remind yourself of your other achievements and strengths. Give yourself more affirmations and encouragement to tide over this.
If you find it challenging to talk to your family or others directly or if you need additional support, you may also consider reaching out to a mental health professional like a school counsellor or online platforms. They can provide a safe space for you to explore healthy ways to work around your emotions.
Here are some platforms you can consider:
2. SOS – 1767 the hotline for SOS is toll-free and you may choose to remain anonymous. You will be speaking to volunteers who are trained to provide emotional support and a listening ear or receive some resources for professional support. You may also consider reaching out to SOS via their CareText function using WhatsApp (9151 1767).

I just want to ORD now but I’m left with 7 months of service.
Idk but sometimes I feel bouts of anxiety overcoming me. At times, I feel alright in camp but sometimes I get overwhelmed with thoughts. Like “am I doing this right?” “am I going to get scolded later” or “will be kena something because of a certain individual” “what if I make a mistake?” etc. Sometimes I feel my heart palpitating quite quickly and such thoughts start to run in my head. At times, I just want to breakdown then and there. I went to go to the MO to talk about this but he just put me down. “This is not anxiety, you are just overthinking. Anxiety is when you cannot go out of your house at all”. That was when I questioned whether am I really anxious or not. Also, when the superiors shout, idk I feel my heart beating faster. idw to reach out to the superiors, scared they would say “man up” “its ns, you are meant to go through it like this” “the previous generation had it harder, you all are the strawberry generation”
I do talk with my family and friends but I feel like I am burdening them with my thoughts when they are busy with work or their studies. I do not talk about this with people in camp as I do not feel comfortable to talk about it with them. I did not get professional help before because I’m scared of what they would say and about the cost of professional help.
Can someone help me?",,0,18756.0,,,,

What you are going through sounds really challenging! Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and feelings with us. It takes courage to open up about experiences with anxiety and overthinking, especially when people around you kept putting you down.
I also want to commend you for surviving through for the past 1 year plus and being so brave in telling people how you feel. It sounds like you have reached out but have been made to question the validity of your own feelings. That is really really tough. It makes you doubt yourself, making you feel confused or even frustrated. I want to affirm you that your feelings are real and it is not easy dealing with these feelings when your environment is not supportive.
It can likely be a case of gaslighting in your interactions with your MO. It is a form of manipulation when a person makes you question your own reality and perception by telling you things like that, so that it helps their situation instead of yours.
Here are some suggestions that may be helpful:
2. Validate your emotions. Do tell yourself that your feelings are real and valid, not to deny your own perception and emotions. Empower yourself more and remind yourself of your strengths.
3. Journaling. Keep a record of things happening that can help affirm your reality. Think about what was going on at that time, note your thoughts and emotions. Writing these down could help allow you to reflect on them more deeply and trust yourself more.
4. Self-care. It can be mental and physical actions that promotes your well-being. Try, engaging in hobbies you enjoy or being good to yourself because you deserve to be treated well.
5. Set boundaries. Think for yourself what behaviours or words are unacceptable, and be firm when voicing your concerns. Being consistent in key to maintaining these boundaries.
6. Talking to people might be helpful as well, if you have a supportive family or friend. It helps in gaining new insights into the situation and might also help you in seeing things in another perspective. Most importantly, reaching out to people can provide emotional support. It might be something that you are really looking for.
If you are thinking about seeking professional support and concerned about the costs, you may consider seeking counselling services provided by the SAF Counselling Centre, or community services. Here are some platforms you can consider:

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your challenges with us. I’m so sorry to hear that the MO gaslighted your experiences. Your feelings and emotions are valid. Well done on recognising that even though someone of authority told you were ‘fine’, you chose to listen to your inner wisdom and reach out for support! Well done!!
Also, you withstood the challenges of NS and have completed almost 70% of it. The last 30% though numerically seems small can still feel like a lot in the body system and it’s okay to acknowledge that you’re feeling overwhelmed and are hoping to have this phase be over. It’s understandable to feel drained and anxious during national service, as it’s a challenging period that demands a lot physically and mentally. Nevertheless, I hope you will join me in taking a few moments to celebrate your wins and your strengths. Going through 17 months of NS is still an achievement. The resilience and grit you have shown thus far should be acknowledged and celebrated.
Recognising that you have bouts of anxiety is a good sign. You are right, anxiety isn’t just about being unable to leave your house; it can manifest in various ways, including the symptoms you described:
- Palpitations: Rapid heartbeats when feeling anxious or scared.
- Overwhelming thoughts: Constant worry about making mistakes or getting scolded.
- Physical symptoms: Feeling the need to break down or escape the situation.
Everyone experiences anxiety to different degrees. It’s our body’s way of signalling that we’re fearful for our safety and well-being. Feeling anxious is a normal and healthy response to a stressful situation; it’s our body’s protective mechanism in action. However, when anxiety starts to hold us hostage, making it difficult to function or trapping us in an unhelpful spiral, it becomes maladaptive. What was meant to protect us can then hinder our daily lives and overall well-being. Depending on how maladaptive the anxiety than the support required will also vary.
Not wanting to be shouted at, fearing if what you did is good enough, and wanting to avoid punishment for someone else’s mistakes are all reasonable concerns. Given the intense nature of national service, it makes sense that your body might feel like it’s in constant threat. It can be helpful to train your brain to distinguish between the challenges you are facing (getting scolded) and an actual life-threatening (tiger in the room) situation.
When you notice unhelpful thoughts, question their validity: Are they based on facts or assumptions? Try to replace them with more balanced thoughts. For example, instead of thinking, “I will get scolded,” consider, “I will do my best, and if I make a mistake, I can learn from it.” Adopting a growth mindset can help you endure the remaining 7 months of national service and possibly even find aspects to enjoy.
Here are some steps that have helped others manage their anxiety. I hope it will help you too.
Deep Breathing: Practice deep breathing exercises. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, then exhale through your mouth for a count of four.
5-4-3-2-1 Technique: Identify 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps ground you in the present moment.
It’s beneficial to practice these techniques outside of triggering moments to enhance their effectiveness. This way, when you first notice sensations like heart palpitations or unhelpful thoughts, it’ll be easier for you to use these skills.
Talk to Someone You Trust:
Even though you might feel like you’re burdening your friends or family, sharing your feelings can provide relief and support. Remember, you are worth their time and energy. If a family member were struggling with a similar situation, would you think they were burdening you? Show yourself the same grace and self-compassion. Connecting with others can make this process feel less lonely. Consider finding a buddy in camp whom you feel comfortable talking to. Sharing experiences can help both of you cope better, and you might be surprised to find that they feel the same way.
Professional Help:
I’ll list some community resources for your consideration at the end. Reaching out to a trained professional counsellor can help you navigate these feelings without judgement. They can also help identify whether these anxiety patterns existed before you joined national service or if they are specific to your NS experience.
Please know that you are not alone, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. National service is a temporary phase, and prioritising your mental health will not only help you get through it but also benefit you in the long run. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Stress wise is manageable to mild from family, friends and work. Have other extra activities on-top of work and also regularly works out. Meets with friends regularly as well. Don’t have a partner but totally okay with it.
Here comes the issue. I think I am depressed? My general outlook of life is that there is no purpose. I have rationalized and gone through how I have come to it. There is no point in working, upkeeping relationships, working out etc everything. At the end of this journey of life, what awaits is, death. But I still go through with it, everything, the many things I do, and I do it well, like a normal, functional, human-being and converse with people normally. I had come to the above consensus for years and a few of my close friends know how about it. But I don’t talk too much about it because it is depressing.
I think another that comes along with being self-diagnosed depressed is that I am emotionally detached. My friends have commented that I don’t look elated or sad when things happen, no matter good or bad. I am just netural. Generally, it has just been good things happening and I am just neutral.

Firstly, I want to say that your thoughts and feelings are incredibly valuable, worth far more than a mere penny.
Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and experiences with us. It sounds to me like you might be pondering some of life’s age-old questions about purpose and meaning. Grappling with existential questions is a common experience, and throughout history, many great minds like Plato and Socrates have delved into these inquiries. It’s entirely natural to contemplate these ideas, and exploring them further can be a pathway to personal growth and a deeper understanding of oneself.
When contemplating a depression diagnosis, it’s crucial to consider various factors. Self-diagnosing depression may not necessarily contribute positively to your well-being. It’s common to experience occasional dips in mood; in fact, our bodies often signal a need for meaningful connection, either with ourselves or with others with whom we feel a sense of belonging.
Exploring existential questions can indeed evoke feelings of sadness for some, particularly if they’re unfamiliar with the topic. If you’re troubled by concerns of experiencing depression, it’s advisable to seek support from mental health professionals for a formal diagnosis. This step ensures you receive the appropriate support and guidance tailored to your individual needs.
Emotional detachment can serve as a protective mechanism, especially if we’ve faced or witness shame or discomfort in expressing our emotions in the past. This coping strategy of appearing ‘neutral’ or ‘numb’ might have developed as a way to shield ourselves from potential harm. While this approach may have been adaptive at one point, it may no longer serve us well.
It seems that feeling emotionally detached and pondering existential questions about life may have triggered a cycle that reinforces feelings of low mood. However, there are steps you can take to break free from this cycle and cultivate a healthier emotional landscape.
One approach is to work on unlearning old coping patterns and replacing them with more adaptive strategies. This could involve practicing mindfulness techniques, engaging in therapy to explore underlying emotions, and seeking support from trusted and skilled individuals.
Additionally, exploring existential questions in a supportive and constructive manner can lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of oneself. By addressing these existential concerns with curiosity and openness, you may find greater clarity and meaning in your life.
Here are some actionable steps to deal with existential questions about life:
Reflection and Journaling: Set aside time for introspection and journaling. Reflect on your beliefs, values, and what matters most to you. Writing down your thoughts can help clarify your feelings and provide insight into your existential concerns.
Engage in Meaningful Activities: Engage in activities that bring meaning and fulfilment to your life. This could include volunteering, pursuing creative interests, spending time with loved ones, or immersing yourself in nature. Doing things that align with your values can provide a sense of purpose and direction.
Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or mindful walking. These practices can help ground you in the present moment and cultivate a sense of acceptance and peace amidst existential uncertainty.
Therapeutic Support: Consider seeking support from a therapist or counsellor who specialises in existential therapy. They can provide guidance, support, and tools to navigate existential concerns and help you find meaning and purpose in your life.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

I am sorry to hear about what you have experienced from your friendships, especially when they are close to you. Feeling used and betrayed by close friends can be a very painful experience, and it’s understandable that you experienced such intense and fluctuating emotions. I think you did a brave act by speaking to them about how you felt, that is the first step you took to protect your boundaries.
Sometimes, people are unable to accept when an individual steps up to draw clear boundaries. It also takes courage for you to be aware of your boundaries and speaking up. Do remember to keep up with the boundaries and know that you are not wrong in doing so.
Perhaps, you can take some time to process your emotions at this moment. Emotions can be complex and may take time to process and heal, it’s important to acknowledge and validate our feelings.
Here are a few steps you might consider:
Self-Compassion: Be kind and compassionate toward yourself. While you might feel that it is hard to forgive yourself for allowing their actions, I hope you try to show some compassion and understanding towards yourself. It is understandable given your close friendships; thus you chose to trust them previously.
It is not your fault at all, please don’t blame yourself for that. You may consider this activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg 1
Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be helpful to process and release emotions. You don’t have to share this with anyone; it’s for your own self-reflection. You can also try to declutter your mind through this simple activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Focus on Self-Care: Engage in activities and self-care practices that promote your overall well-being. This might include exercise, engaging in hobbies, keeping to a routine or spending time with supportive family/friends.
Maybe it would be helpful to minimise contact with them and only do so if it is for work. Have some time for yourself process your own emotions. Remember your emotions are valid, and it’s okay to take the time you need to move forward.

The hurt was so bad, I had difficulty breathing. I went through the entire scenario, looking to close each chapter by accepting it and even try to forgive myself. I am actually making some improvement until the guy’s behaviour starting to get on my nerves again. I started to have breathing difficulty again coz I was so upset.
Recently whenever we have to communicate for work, he tried to be friendly, even using emojis to lighten the conversation. It really annoys me but I maintain my stand. He always sat with the lady at work and dare not even approach to ask me about work face to face, which is kind of a relief for me. Just last week, he texted me and said will come to my desk to ask me about work, which is something that can solved with a text message. Then I realised that lady is in a meeting. What kind behavior is that? The boundaries that I set is very clear, what is he trying to do?
Another set back was from another colleague who is part of the group. She knew about the situation way before but did not mentioned anything to me. When I found out, she was the one who confirmed that they are together and she listened to me. She shared my anger but in the end, she chose to stick with them. Honestly, I am not angry with her decision and I respected it.
But I am not sure if it’s her guilt playing a part, she will come and talk to me whenever they are not around. Trying to ask me out for workout again and again even when it did not happen most of the time. She ended up going with them instead.

It does sounds hard when they are making contact with you when you are not comfortable with it.
I sensed that you get angry because you set a boundary yet they seemed to be violating it by trying to talk to you.
If you can, take some time to pay attention to own emotions and thoughts. Understand that you feel triggered because they do not seem to acknowledge your boundaries. Focus on what you can control, not so much on them (what you cannot control). By doing this, you can empower yourself, I don’t want you to feel helpless in this situation.
Do continue to maintain limiting interactions with them. You can say that you are not ready to interact and just want to be alone for now.
When you feel anxious, here are suggestions for you to consider trying:
2. Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
3. Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.
You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).
4. Physical activity – It can be to go out of office for a walk, exercise after work, anything to release any pent-up energy within yourself.
5. Mindfulness meditation - Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment without judgment. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. You can start by trying simple mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing or guided meditation (easily available on YouTube), to help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Check out Balance Yourself

Great to hear that the breathing exercises work! And I am proud to hear that you have been clear with your boundaries.
While I may not be able to pinpoint the reasons why he keeps doing certain actions, I am glad that you are maintaining your boundaries. The thing with boundaries is that some people will keep pushing. Their intentions can be unclear to us, what matters most is how we can be consistent with our boundaries. Hopefully, one day he will understand that you are firm and stop pushing.

That sounds incredibly uncomfortable and overwhelming. It must be exhausting to have your mind constantly analysing every interaction so closely. I’m sorry to hear that you’re going through this. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of stress and self-doubt around social interactions. Thank you for reaching out to us. It takes a lot of courage to share such personal experiences, and I want to commend you for that. Your strength and resilience in coping with these feelings for so long are truly admirable. Also, thank you for reaching out for support; it is a step in the right direction. Well done!
Feeling nervous in social situations is pretty normal, and lots of people go through it to different extents. Sometimes, even I get a bit anxious in new places, and I end up thinking about what I’m doing too. This is just our body’s way of telling us that we want to fit in and be friends with others. Everyone wants to feel like they belong. It’s a natural thing that helps keep us safe, but sometimes it can make us worry too much, especially if we’ve had bad experiences before. It’s like our brain’s software needs an update. We can do this by taking small steps to feel more comfortable in social situations. That way, our brain won’t think social stuff is scary.
May I please invite you to consider trying the following steps to help manage these feelings:
2. Practice Mindfulness: Try to stay present in the moment instead of letting your mind dwell on past interactions or worry about future ones. Mindfulness techniques like deep breathing or focusing on your senses can help bring you back to the present.
3. Challenge Negative Thoughts: When you catch yourself overthinking or worrying about how you come across in social situations, challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself if there’s any real evidence to support them, and try to reframe them in a more positive or realistic light.
4. Set Realistic Expectations: Remember that nobody is perfect, and it’s okay to make mistakes or have awkward moments in social interactions. Try to set more realistic expectations for yourself and accept that not every interaction will go perfectly.
5. Gradual Exposure: Instead of avoiding social situations altogether, try gradually exposing yourself to them in small doses. Start with low-pressure situations and gradually work your way up to more challenging ones.
6. Seek Support: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. They can provide a safe space for you to explore your thoughts and feelings without judgment.

You’re most welcome.
Fear can feel overwhelming, and that’s completely normal. It’s designed to protect us from danger, like encountering a tiger in the wild. Our bodies have evolved this way. However, it’s important to help reprogram and teach our brain and body that interacting with someone isn’t the same as facing a tiger, even if it feels that way sometimes.
You don’t have to face your fears alone—please reach out for support.

Firstly, thank you for reaching out to us on this platform. Dealing with doubt and mistrust can be incredibly challenging, and I commend you for your courage in opening up about your experiences. I also want to acknowledge your resilience in managing these emotions over time. It takes strength to confront such feelings, and your willingness to seek support and explore your thoughts is commendable.
It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a challenging situation. Trust is a fundamental aspect of any relationship, and it’s understandable that you’re struggling with it after what happened. It’s important to consider your feelings and the impact this incident has had on your mental health and the relationship as a whole.
Breaking up is a significant decision and should not be taken lightly. Before making a decision, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and concerns. Express how this incident has affected you and your ability to trust her. Listen to her perspective as well, as understanding each other’s feelings is crucial for any resolution.
You could also consider seeking support from a counsellor or therapist. They can provide a neutral space for both of you to explore your feelings, improve communication, and work towards rebuilding trust if that’s what you both want.
Ultimately, the decision to break up or stay together is yours to make based on what feels right for you and your well-being. Take the time you need to reflect on your feelings and consider all options before making a decision.
Journaling can be a helpful tool for gaining insights and clarity. Here are five reflective questions you can consider:
2. What are my core values and needs in a relationship? Reflect on your fundamental values, such as trust, respect, honesty, communication, and emotional support. Consider whether these values are being met in your current relationship and how important they are to your overall happiness and well-being.
3. How has the incident affected my trust and mental health over time? Explore the impact of the past incident on your ability to trust your partner and how it has influenced your mental and emotional well-being. Consider any patterns or recurring thoughts and feelings related to trust issues.
4. What efforts have both my partner and I made to rebuild trust and address the underlying issues? Evaluate the steps taken by both you and your partner to address the trust issue and improve the relationship. Reflect on whether these efforts have been effective and sustainable in rebuilding trust and resolving conflicts.
5. What are my hopes and fears about the future of this relationship? Consider your aspirations, fears, and expectations regarding the future of your relationship. Reflect on whether you see potential for growth, improvement, and happiness together or if there are persistent concerns and doubts that are difficult to overcome.
6. How do I envision my ideal relationship, and does my current relationship align with that vision? Envision your ideal partnership in terms of communication, trust, emotional connection, support, and mutual goals. Compare this vision with the reality of your current relationship and assess whether there is alignment or significant discrepancies.
Journaling about these reflective questions can help you gain clarity, identify underlying emotions and patterns, and make informed decisions about whether to continue working on the relationship or consider other options such as a breakup.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

It sounds like you’re going through a challenging time. Thank you for sharing your challenges with us. I appreciate your courage to be vulnerable and open. It’s great that you’re aware of your feelings and seeking help. The difficulties you’re experiencing, such as feeling tired during the day and struggling to sleep at night due to overthinking, could indeed be related to anxiety or depression. It might be helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can provide a proper assessment and guidance on managing these issues.
Regarding your concerns about body image and acne, it’s common to feel self-conscious about physical appearance, especially when dealing with acne or undergoing treatments like Accutane. May I suggest considering this perspective too, that beauty is subjective, and your worth isn’t defined by your appearance. Many other strengths and traits are within you that are worth celebrating and appreciating. However, if these thoughts are significantly impacting your mood and self-esteem, therapy or counseling could offer strategies to improve body image and cope with negative thoughts.
Your mention of past behaviours like vomiting food and worries about unnecessary things like home security also indicate a level of distress that could benefit from professional support. These behaviours and concerns can be addressed through therapy, where you can learn coping skills, challenge negative thought patterns, and work on improving your overall well-being.
Feeling easily irritated or giving people the cold shoulder sounds like your nervous system is signaling that it needs more support. These reactions may stem from underlying stress or emotional struggles. Learning healthy communication and coping strategies through therapy can help manage these emotions and improve your relationships.
Overall, seeking professional support, such as speaking with a therapist or counsellor, can provide you with the tools and guidance to navigate these challenges and improve your mental and emotional well-being. Remember that it’s okay to ask for help, and taking steps towards self-care and self-improvement is a brave and positive decision.

Firstly, thank you for reaching out to us on this platform. We value your trust. I can only imagine how tough it is for you to experience such strong and uncomfortable emotions frequently. Dealing with body image issues, stress, and depression can be incredibly challenging, especially as a student juggling academic pressures and personal struggles. It takes courage to open up about these feelings, and I want to acknowledge your strength in reaching out for advice.
Let’s take a moment and celebrate your resilience, acknowledging your bravery in sharing your struggles. Your incredible strength in navigating these feelings for such a long time is truly commendable.
Learning to cope with multiple things that demand our attention is a life skill. It’s important to give yourself the time and grace to learn these skills. May I suggest as a first step is practicing self compassion and acceptance. Self-compassion means being kind and understanding towards yourself, just like you would be towards a good friend. It involves recognising that everyone makes mistakes and experiences challenges, and that’s okay. Self-compassion also means being patient with yourself and not being too hard on yourself when things don’t go as planned. It’s about treating yourself with the same care and empathy that you would show to others who are going through a tough time. Ultimately, self-compassion helps you build a positive relationship with yourself and promotes mental and emotional well-being.
Feeling numb, comfort eating, mindless scrolling are some of the ways how the body helps us to cope when we feel overwhelmed. This tells me that your body is doing its best to help you feel safe even though the strategy may no longer be helpful. Please know that there is nothing wrong with you, you are amazing just the way you are even if it doesn’t feel like that now. There is enough time to help our brain and body learn new skills and strategies that can be more helpful.
Here are some suggestions that might help:
2. Seek Support: I’d like to encourage you to reach out to your school counsellor, teacher, or a trusted adult and share your challenges with them. You don’t have to face these challenges alone. A counsellor can offer personalised guidance and support specifically tailored to your needs.
3. Healthy Coping Strategies: Explore healthier ways to cope with stress instead of turning to food. This could include activities like exercise, meditation, journaling, or spending time outdoors. Whenever the urge comes for you to do something that is no longer helpful, set a timer for 5mins and do a different activity. For example, listen to a song, do some jumping jacks, take deep breaths, or do one of the following guided activities:

Managing Feelings & Emotions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-MyQgfH3A
4. Mindful Eating: Practice mindful eating by paying attention to your body’s hunger and fullness cues. Try to eat balanced meals and avoid skipping meals, as this can lead to overeating later on. Start off with one meal where you mindfull eat and enjoy the meal without any distractions. Take your time to chew and savour the taste. You can begin with just one minute at each meal and work your way up to practicing mindful eating at each meal.
5. Challenge Negative Thoughts: Challenge negative thoughts about your body by focusing on your strengths and accomplishments. Surround yourself with positive influences and practice self-compassion. Start a “book of wins”, in this book you jot down every win that you had in the day. It can be as simple as you got up and brushed your teeth even though you didn’t feel like it. Over time this will help you see all the gains you have rather than focusing on the gaps in your life.
6. Limit Social Media: Limit your time on social media, as excessive scrolling can contribute to negative self-image and feelings of inadequacy. Instead, engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Activate the digital well-being option on your phone and set time limits on the apps.
7. Set Realistic Goals: Set small, achievable goals for yourself, both academically and personally. Celebrate your progress along the way and be kind to yourself during setbacks. Aim to improve just by 1% a day, at the end of the month you would have improved by 30%.
Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to seek support and take small steps towards feeling better. Take care of yourself and keep prioritise your mental and emotional well-being. You got this!

2. put less emphasis on other’s opinions and care a lot more for what you feel abt yourself. I used to wanna lose weight cos I feel like others find me undesirable in some ways, so my motivation was not right and it made me feel worse. Now I changed my perspective in focusing on myself yknow, I realise I also don’t like myself when I’m heavy cos I feel unfit and unhealthy, so now I focus on keeping myself fit, doing some efforts in exercising for the right reason, and it is so much less demoralising for me. Dk if you can relate~
3. when it comes to productivity, focus on finding ways to enjoy the process when doing things you need/want to do. Like the idea is to focus your energy on doing things in ways that brings you more energy. I may not like studying, but if I make it fun for myself by drawing mind maps instead of only writing notes. Or I give myself small breaks in between work cos I cannot do long hours at one go.
we can get things done but choose exactly how we wanna do it that works best for us:muscle:t3:

Im not doing great for chem and the maths and my teachers have been implying i’m stupid and i feel really hurt. i also really really hate getting called on but for some reason all teachers really like calling on me this year and i panic so bad that i get panic attacks multiple times in one school day.

Thank you for coming here to share your struggles with us and I am sorry to hear that you have such experiences with your teachers and classmates in school. I am sure you really did your best, please don’t deny yourself of that. Your effort matters and I hope you can affirm yourself more.
Remember that everyone has their own strengths and your self-worth is not defined by 1 or 2 subjects. It is so unfair when people cannot see that but I really hope you can focus more on what you are good at. That’s how you make things fair for yourself.
It does sounds like you excel in subjects that are more language based and require critical thinking, exploration in human experiences and interest in understanding of the world. Subjects like Maths and Chemistry can be rather different in terms of analytic thinking and calculation. There may be a clash due to your own experiences and interests, it is not fair to define yourself as being poor in academics just because you lack interest in those subjects. It is helpful to remind yourself that you still try very hard and have not given up; that is a great strength you have!
You may consider changing your approaches and your perspectives towards the challenges. It can be having someone who can support you in different learning styles in Maths, to get you interested and feel more encouraged. Being interested can be a helpful start towards being familiar with the subject and improving your grades.
When you are feeling anxious, take a deep breath and calm yourself down first. Remind yourself to take 1 step at a time and be patient with yourself. Here are suggestions for you to consider trying when you find yourself feeling anxious:
2. Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
3. Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.
You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).
4. Physical activity – It can be to exercise, walk around, jump a little, anything to release any pent-up energy within yourself.
I hope this helps. Hope to hear more from you. Take care!",,2,,17546,,17546.0,

Actually, one of my friend was caught up in a similar scenario back when I was in secondary school. She did so poorly in math that she even went to get herself tested for dyslexia! Just for fun, I’m not asking u to get tested.
Even I was a slow bloomer for maths when I was studying in sec 3. It took me close to a year for me to realise that I was weak in A math. But that didn’t stop me. Apart from asking for consultations, I practised all my textbook questions, especially for A maths, which helped me get familiar with solving and strategising approaches to solve the questions.

My chem teacher used to say that performance in A math and chem are linked. I guess it is in the way you have to use multiple approaches to answer the same question. But as for chem, you have to use keywords instead of layman terms while explaining chem concepts. To do so, you have to have a thorough understanding of the content in your textbook.

Don’t be afraid of being called on. Take it as an opportunity to get validated by your teacher on how you are understanding the concept taught in class. Personally, when my teacher asked for suggestions to make the classes better, I suggested giving everyone an opportunity to work out the problems on the board as it could help us learn from others’ mistakes. So, utilise each opportunity u get to the fullest!

11773,Stressed & Burnt out at work. Again.,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/stressed-burnt-out-at-work-again/11773,Coping,---,9635,fifteendaffodils,User,,17611,1,"So I left my previous job because I felt like I was working way too hard and way too long hours in a place where I didn’t feel like I was learning anything, nor did I have the mentorship that could help me grow in my career. Fast forward to today, I’m now in a role where I genuinely like the nature of my work, can see potential to grow, and like the people I work with.
I’m coming to the end of my 2nd year, and while things were more stable and optimistic when I joined, the past few months has been crazy hectic. I was so burnt out early this year I broke down and had to ask to day a few days off. After I returned, I had genuine convos with my bosses where they expressed concern and regret for the state that I was in, and acknowledged that it was in part an oversight on their end that I was pushed to take on so much at one time. We also agreed upon some measures to increase visibility on resource and project management to avoid a similar situation.
The problem is, 3 months after that break down, I’m in a similar situation yet again where I have pressure to take on more projects than I can handle at a time, simply because we have so much work that everybody is over their capacity. And while the last time I felt like I could give my bosses the benefit of the doubt that they didn’t realise how much I had on my plate because they weren’t aware of the projects each of the individually didn’t have visibility on. But now, I think I (and my other colleagues as well) have been vocal enough of why I cannot take on more work and am struggling. I’m quite sure they are aware that I am overwhelmed, but I don’t feel like they are doing anything concrete to help alleviate this resource crunch.
I do understand that there’s not much they can do either, because the work just needs to be done and we just don’t have that resource. But am I just being selfish or too naive to expect my bosses to care for my wellbeing? Is it not part of management’s responsibility to make sure that our workload isn’t overwhelming?
Also, because of how stressed I was this week, I was a little too sensitive and made some hostile push backs to a colleague I am usually really nice and friendly to. I feel bad for my aggressive tone, and we cleared up that there was no ill intent, but that really affected my mood the entire day. So much so that I forgot I was meeting my friends for a birthday celebration the next day and had to bail on it. This slip up was kinda of a wake up call that my mental state is really not in a good place, and I hate the fact that I’m still thinking about the work that needs to be done at this point. How can I learn to set better boundaries, and not let my work stress seep into my personal life?",,1,,,,,

Firstly, thank you for reaching out and sharing your experiences with us. I appreciate you taking the time to pen it all out. From your sharing, I get the sense that you’ve been through a lot in your recent work experiences. I can only imagine how challenging it was for you to keep pushing yourself to meet the various heavy demands. It sounds to me like you’re also a person with great skills and resilience. It’s great that you were able to recognise your limits and communicate them to your bosses. It shows self-awareness and a desire for a healthy work-life balance. Well done! It was also heart-warming to read that you were able to repair the relationship with your colleague.
Your concerns about feeling overwhelmed and your bosses not taking enough action to address the resource crunch are valid. It’s normal to expect management to consider employee well-being when managing workloads. It might be worth having another conversation with your bosses to revisit the measures you agreed upon earlier and discuss any additional strategies that could help manage the workload more effectively.
As for setting better boundaries and preventing work stress from affecting your personal life, please allow me to share more information about boundary setting. Setting effective boundaries is usually two-pronged: boundaries for others and equally important is boundaries for self.
The following are some tips you might find helpful for setting boundaries.
Setting Boundaries with Others:
- Permission: Giving yourself permission to hold boundaries is crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life balance and managing stress effectively.
- Decide on the type of boundaries needed for self and others.
- Communicate those boundaries clearly to your colleagues and superiors.
o E.g, if you need uninterrupted time to focus on a task, let your team know that you won’t be available for meetings or non-urgent requests during certain hours.
o E.g, I will not respond to work calls or emails after working hours.
- Assertive Communication: Use assertive communication techniques to assert your boundaries while respecting others. Practice using “I” statements to express your feelings and needs without coming across as aggressive or defensive.
- Expectations: Manage expectations by setting realistic deadlines and deliverables. Be transparent about what you can realistically accomplish within a given timeframe to avoid over-committing yourself.
- Consequences: Follow up on the consequences for others. Say no when necessary. It’s okay to say no to additional tasks or commitments when your plate is already full. Prioritise tasks based on importance and urgency, and politely decline requests that exceed your capacity.
o For example, letting the phone ring and not answering the work call.
- Space: Allow room for mistakes, growth, feedback and then trying again or making tweaks.
o For example, allowing for one-off high-need calls. You can predetermine how many such calls you will entertain in a month or year.
Setting Boundaries with Self:
- Self-Awareness: Pay attention to your own limits and signs of burnout. Listen to your body and mind, and acknowledge when you need to take breaks or step back from work temporarily.
- Prioritise Self-Care: Please prioritise activities that help you relax and recharge outside of work, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones. Try scheduling and blocking time out in your calendar.
- Set Clear Work Boundaries: Define specific times for work and non-work activities. Avoid checking work emails or messages outside of work hours whenever possible. Activate the work profile option in your phone or mute the notifications after working hours.
- Practice Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself and avoid self-criticism for needing to set boundaries. Recognise that taking care of your well-being is essential for long-term productivity and happiness.
- Delegate and Collaborate: Don’t hesitate to delegate tasks when appropriate, and collaborate with colleagues to share the workload more evenly.
- Routines: Establish daily routines that support your well-being, such as regular meal times, adequate sleep, and dedicated relaxation periods. Stick to these routines to maintain better balance and reduce stress.
- Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness techniques into your daily routine, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, to help manage stress and stay present in the moment. This can aid you to be calmer to avoid potential unintended conflict with colleagues.
- Seek Support: Don’t hesitate to seek support from colleagues, mentors, or mental health professionals if you’re struggling to maintain boundaries or manage stress effectively. It’s okay to ask for help when you need it.
By granting yourself the authority to establish and maintain boundaries, both in your interactions with others and with yourself, you empower yourself to cultivate a work environment that prioritises well-being and enhances productivity.
It’s natural to feel some discomfort initially when asserting your boundaries and advocating for your needs. However, setting boundaries is a skill that improves with practice and time.
Achieving a healthier balance between work and personal life is an ongoing process, and it’s perfectly acceptable to seek support and make adjustments as needed along the way.
If you have any further questions or would like to discuss more, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
Wishing you all the best in your journey towards a more balanced and fulfilling life.

11773,Stressed & Burnt out at work. Again.,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/stressed-burnt-out-at-work-again/11773,Coping,---,9635,fifteendaffodils,User,,17698,3,"Thanks for taking time to respond @CoolBreeze!! You made me feel very validated and heard. I am definitely in a better place after being able to process some of that frustration and negative emotions.
Looking more rationally at what happened again, I do see how a lot of my stress came from me putting pressure on myself to deliver on unrealistic expectations. I think part of this pressure can be easily resolved because I recognise that when I’m overwhelmed, sometimes I forget to check if those expectations were just my own assumptions or if people I’m working with really hold those expectations. So being more mindful and learning to pause and maybe just take a deep breath before reacting could help mitigate this.
Another part, I feel, is more complicated. I tend to feel disappointed in myself if I have to turn a request down, even if the request is not realistic. As long as the ask is not unreasonable, and I can see the value in it, I will overstretch myself in order to fulfill it. I think I find rejecting a request, or asking for more time / compromising, more uncomfortable than burning myself out. And putting that into words makes me realise how I should value myself more, but I also find it very challenging to put this into practice.
A big struggle I have is that I think I’m also not very good at saying no gently but assertively. So my rejections tend to fall on either end of the spectrum, where it either comes off too weak and I end up saying yes anyway, or too abrasive where I then blame myself for hurting feelings or being too cold. Do you have any practical advice on how to be assertive, but still gentle in setting boundaries with others?
Also a note to anyone who found my post relatable in one way or another: hang in there, you’re not alone! Your feelings are valid and you are worthy of love and support",,1,,,,,

I’m really glad to hear that you’re feeling validated and heard. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot of reflection and growth, which is amazing. Recognizing the sources of your stress and taking steps to address them is such an important part of self-care. Well done @fifteendaffodils, I’m proud of you!
It’s great that you’ve identified two key areas where you can make changes. Being more mindful and pausing before reacting can definitely help in managing unrealistic expectations. It gives you the space to evaluate whether those expectations are truly external or self-imposed.
Regarding your difficulty in saying no assertively yet gently, that’s a common challenge. One practical tip is to practice assertive communication. This means being clear, firm, and respectful in expressing your boundaries. Start by acknowledging the request positively, then clearly state your limits or offer an alternative that works for you.
Here are some examples:
- I appreciate your trust in me, and I want to deliver quality work. However, I’m currently committed to other projects. Can we discuss a revised timeline or alternative solution?
- Thank you for considering me for this project. However, I currently have a full plate with my current assignments. I’m open to discussing priorities or adjusting timelines if necessary.
- I value our friendship and want to support you, but I need to balance my commitments too. In the future, could we plan these requests in advance to make sure it fits into my schedule?
For a start, you may want to begin with improving your skill in using “I statements” and “Assertive Body language”.
“I” statements are a powerful tool in assertive communication because they focus on your own feelings and experiences without placing blame or judgment on others. They help you express yourself assertively while maintaining respect for the other person. For example, instead of saying, “You always expect too much from me,” try, “I feel overwhelmed when I have too many tasks at once.”
Here’s how you can use “I” statements effectively:
- Express Your Feelings: Start your statement with “I feel…” followed by an emotion. For example, “I feel overwhelmed when I have too many tasks at once.”
- State the Behavior: Describe the specific behavior or situation that is causing your feelings. For instance, “When I receive multiple project requests with short deadlines…”
- Impact on You: Explain how the behavior or situation impacts you personally. For example, “…it makes it difficult for me to focus and deliver quality work.”
- Request or Boundary: Clearly state what you need or what boundary you want to set. For instance, “I would appreciate it if we could discuss priorities and deadlines to ensure I can manage my workload effectively.”
Using “I” statements shifts the focus to your experiences and needs, fostering understanding and constructive dialogue.
Assertive body language complements your verbal communication and reinforces your assertiveness. Here are some tips for using assertive body language:
- Eye Contact: Maintain steady eye contact without staring or looking away excessively. It shows confidence and engagement in the conversation.
- Posture: Stand or sit upright with your shoulders back. Avoid slouching or crossing your arms, as this can convey defensiveness or discomfort.
- Gestures: Use open and relaxed gestures to emphasize your points. Avoid gestures that appear aggressive or defensive, such as pointing fingers or crossing your arms tightly.
- Facial Expressions: Keep your facial expressions neutral or friendly, depending on the context. Avoid frowning or scowling, as it can send negative signals.
- Tone of Voice: Use a calm and steady tone of voice. Avoid raising your voice or speaking too softly, as it can undermine your assertiveness.
Practicing assertive body language enhances your overall communication style, making your messages more convincing and impactful. It also helps you project confidence and command respect in interactions. By incorporating these tips into your communication style and practicing them regularly, you can become more assertive and assert your needs confidently in various situations. Make it a game and practice these skills in a non-triggering environment, for example with close friends or strangers ( if it is more comfortable for you) like service crews.
It might feel uncomfortable at first, but with practice, it becomes easier. Remember, setting boundaries is not about being cold or hurting feelings—it’s about valuing your well-being and ensuring a healthy balance. It is normal to experience uncomfortable emotions when asserting yourself or setting boundaries. Our strength in this skill is often influenced by past life experiences, especially in childhood. Our attachment styles play a significant role in how comfortable we feel in expressing our needs and desires to others. I’d like to encourage you to consider seeking support from a counsellor. They can offer emotional guidance and help you explore your attachment style, enabling you to improve your communication and emotional well-being.
I hope the above is helpful. If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out!

I want to commend you on your courage in sharing and also to affirm you for being so strong in coping with these feelings for so long.
It sounds like you have been getting angry with yourself and being rather critical towards yourself when things happen. Sometimes, it can be due to a survival strategy as you do not want to repeat certain mistakes or trying to gain control over a situation. I hope that while you apply such coping techniques, you also learn to balance self-blame with self-compassion. Here are some suggestions for you to consider:
2. Acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes and it is more about reflecting on what you learned from those experiences so you can make positive changes moving forward.
3. Acknowledge and validate your feelings without judgement. Anger is an emotion that often arise due to threat, fears or a violation to one’s beliefs. It is a natural response that comes up as a defence to yourself and it is not wrong to feel angry. It is more about how you manage this anger constructively so it addresses the issue without causing harm.
4. Consider external factors that were involved in the situation, which are out of your control. Instead of blaming yourself entirely, be fair and kind to yourself in considering the other factors. Sometimes, things happen and we try to make the best decision for ourselves at that point of time.
5. Reframe negative thoughts into what is realistic and constructive, this could be helpful in creating a balance when you find yourself overthinking. People tend to overthink for various reasons, which could be caused by fear (failure, consequences) or desires (for control, positive outcome). It might be helpful to identify what is causing the need to overthink, to help yourself gain a balance.
6. Talking to people might be helpful as well, if you have a supportive family or friend. It helps in gaining new insights into the situation and might also help you in seeing things in another perspective. Most importantly, reaching out to people can provide emotional support. It might be something that you are really looking for.
I am also concerned about you scratching yourself as a punitive approach. I don’t want you to hurt yourself, I am sure people around you would care about you in the same way as well. I see that meditation is not something that you find helpful, and don’t worry about that because everyone has their own ways of coping with emotions. I just hope that you are able to cope with ways that are helpful and not hurtful to yourself. Here are some alternate suggestions for you to consider trying:
2. Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
3. Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious. You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).
4. Fidget toys – It can be something to keep your hands occupied and to provide sensory stimulation without causing hurt to yourself.
5. Physical activity – It can be to walk around, jump a little, anything to release any pent-up energy within yourself.
6. Identify your triggers. Think about what triggers and distracts you. What is the primary issue that is causing you to feel upset. Reflect on your past experiences. Were there situations when you felt triggered, what contributed to those feelings and how you coped with it then.
7. Journaling. Track your reactions when you feel strong emotions or engage in certain behaviours. What was going on at that time, note your thoughts and emotions. Writing these down could help allow you to reflect on them more deeply. This can possibly help you gain insight or new perspectives to the situation.
8. Self-care. Eat and sleep well. Having a balanced diet and being well-rested contributes to regulating mood and improving cognitive function. Take some time to engage in activities you enjoy.
9. Positive self-talk: It is important how you speak to yourself. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself.
Do take time to think about your strengths and what have kept you going thus far. I believe you have lots of positive qualities and abilities; and you need to focus more on that. From your sharing, it sounds like you are looking at yourself in a negative light and that will further discourage you. You are still seeking different ways to cope with your difficulties, and you have not given up even though it has been really challenging. I think this is something you really need to affirm yourself for.
I’d like to end off by thanking you again for your courage in sharing. Please know that you are not alone, and that there is hope for healing as long as you don’t give up on yourself. You’ve come a long way and we are here to support you.
Wishing you all the best!",,2,,,,,

Thank you for coming here to share your struggles with us on this platform. It sounds really difficult for you as you navigate through your school life without having people you can feel comfortable talking to.
I wonder if you have friends outside of school or a trusted family member whom you can approach when you feel that you are having a hard time. I see you mentioned your concerns about making others worry thus not sharing about how you feel. I believe there are people around you who are concerned about you and could be worried even if you are not talking about it.
It is important to know that reaching out and seeking support is a natural and healthy way of coping with life issues. Everyone goes through difficult periods in their lives and sometimes sharing your feelings may pull the relationship closer. Perhaps connection is something you need at this point so please do not deny yourself of that due to your worries.
Also, I am a little concerned about your ways of coping. Do you hurt yourself or require any medication after scratching yourself? Sometimes, people get in a repetitive way of doing things to help themselves cope when thoughts get overwhelming. I hope you are able to cope with ways that are helpful and not hurtful to yourself. Here are some alternate suggestions for you to consider trying:
- Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
- Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.

- Fidget toys – It can be something to keep your hands occupied and to provide sensory stimulation without causing hurt.
- Physical activity – It can be to walk around, jump a little, anything to release any pent-up energy within yourself.
- Mindfulness meditation - Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment without judgment. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. You can start by trying simple mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing or guided meditation (easily available on YouTube), to help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Check out Balance Yourself
Remember that you are not alone in this journey, and I believe that there are people around you who genuinely care for you and want to be support you in this, so please do not worry about being a burden to others.
You may also consider making an appointment with your school counsellor or consult with an external professional to talk it out.

Having a hobby will definitely be helpful! It is always good to engage in activities that brings release of tension (exercising) or brings positive feelings such as hobbies, or activities that you enjoy. It might also help in cultivating positive connections with people.

thats not the point. coz right now, even with all positive things that are happening, ie: decent grades, decent friends. I feel like a fraud. like im living 2 lives, i dont deserve this and even if i did, what is the point?
friends will eventually drift away and it will all fall back to square one what is square one?
square on is where i know im unwanted, un-needed and a waste of oxygen. the only thing keeping me going is that i signed on for this and even if it is the lkast thing i do, i will finish what i started. which namely is my diploma.

Thank you for coming here to share your concerns. It sounds like you are going through a confusing life situation right now. I hear that things are difficult, and you seem to be feeling somewhat lost and in need of some connection at this point.
It must have been hard for you to work things out on your own and having to deal with things at home with your mom. I wonder how long it has been going out and how it has affected your life and views about your relationships with people.
From what you shared, I see a lot of resilience in you as you talk about completing your diploma even when things are not going well for you. I am sure there were other instances where things were challenging but you pushed through and navigated through the obstacles.
I hope you can see that in yourself as well and use these as reminders or motivation for yourself. There is a reason why you do this, perhaps it could be life goals like completing education, getting a job, financial independency etc. Identify your goals and you can find your own purpose in life.
Practicing positive self-talk can be something you can consider. It would be good to be mindful of how you think about yourself and not to be too critical towards yourself. Be kind to yourself as you validate your life experiences and your emotions.
Also, I want to remind you that you are important, and you deserve to have good things happening to you. Perhaps some people in your life may not have been able to provide you with helpful support or affirmations. But don’t deny yourself of this too. You deserve good things in life even if you do not feel this way yet. It is important to feel good about yourself, I am sure you have many strengths and perhaps that’s why people hang out with you.
Meanwhile, I wonder if you have someone you can reach out to for support. It can be anyone; family, friends, or a professional to share what you are going through. If you are open to seeing a professional, here are some options you can consider:

Good to hear from you again. It sounds like you are someone who thinks things through before making decisions, and I think you know what is best for yourself.
Everyone has their own answers within themselves. These are built by past experiences in life and interactions with people. It might be helpful to trust your instincts and go with what you think is good for you.
What matters the most is you, in believing that you are important and deserving of good things. While you may have reflected and accepted the fact that people can be replaceable in work, it does not mean that your experience there and relationships built were for nothing.

I hear you, and it is completely understandable to feel isolated when you don’t have the social support you need. It is okay to acknowledge these feelings and to use this as an opportunity to reflect on what you really want at this moment.
If you are seeking connections, you can explore new ways to connect with people, join new communities to know people. It takes time and can feel daunting at first. Take a step at a time and be patient with yourself while you navigate around this. Remember, you are deserving of positive support and companionship, I hope you get to find it in time.

Ever since I started work, I feel stressed most of the time at work. I feel like giddy, dizzy and sometimes I felt that my heart is pounding. After work, I felt okay. All those happened during working. I have to work for six years since I was being sponsored by my company during diploma school back in 2015. Some of the days, at work, even I am doing fine, seeing my colleague are busy, made me stressed. I have tried to calm myself down. At work, I felt like I am not breathing enough when it gets busy. My six years bond was almost finishing this 2024 end of May. And my boss offered me for advanced diploma to study further and will be bonded for another two years till 2027. Well, after I study for advanced diploma, I will be more stressed than now because my skills are upgraded and I have seen how my seniors work in a stressful environment. Therefore, at first I want to quit and change new job. I told my boss that I don’t want to study. However, I met a Fri who just finished advanced diploma, I find it that she learnt a lot and I want to develop my knowledge and skills as well. So here is the thing, my heart wants me to quit the job and find less stressful job but my head says I should go study. So I have decided to follow my head instead of heart. I further study and now I am doing it. Often, I wondered what if I cannot cope with the stress that I will be experiencing later on . I have been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 1 year ago and now I am taking meds. What if the stress worsen my health? I have been thought through all these. And I said it myself that it’s ok I will go through this period.
Now I am confused and felt regretted for studying. but since I have already agreed to take sponsorship, I can’t break the bond right now. If I break the bond, I will have to compensate the amount which is about 50K plus which I cannot afford. I know the only thing is to move forward and finish the 2 years bond.
I have been practising all kinds of anxiety relieving strategy. But I felt like my anxiety level is not reduced. Do you think I should go and see a doctor for some kind of meds. Please kindly help.",,0,,,,,

I am so sorry to hear about what you have been going through. It must have been difficult for you over the past years to be feeling stressed and anxious at work. I am wondering what is causing all these to you that is causing you to be physically affected as well. Is it too much work, expectations at work, comparing yourself with others or other reasons? For stress-related concerns, it is usually helpful to find out the root cause of the issue so you can be supported in the most appropriate way.
I hear that you have taken on the offer, and you are somewhat feeling doubtful whether it is the right decision. It is very courageous and resilient of you though, as you identified that you still want to move forward and finish your studies. That is a goal you have set and I believe you made that decision with your best interests at heart. This seemed to be something you really want, it could be a lack of confidence in what lies ahead as you manage your studies with work and the possibility of having heavier workload after graduation. Regarding the future, it may be good to have a discussion with your boss after you graduate about the expectations of the work responsibilities and for you to be really honest so you both can set realistic expectations and work goals.
As for now, you may consider the following options in helping to cope with your anxiety:
2. Self-compassion: Be kind and compassionate toward yourself. While you might feel in trying to keep up with the pace and pushing yourself, I hope you try to show some compassion and understanding towards yourself. You have a lot of strengths and I believe there is a reason why you were offered the advanced education opportunity. There may be qualities people see in you that you cannot see for yourself. Do affirm yourself more and focus more on your strengths.
3. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be helpful to process and release emotions. Track your reactions when you feel stressed or anxious, so you can identify what was going on at that time (your thoughts and emotions). Writing these down could help allow you to reflect on them more deeply. This can possibly help you gain insight or new perspectives to the situation. You don’t have to share this with anyone; it’s for your own self-reflection.
4. Challenge negative thoughts: Identify what are some thoughts that pull you down and make you feel bad about yourself. Think about whether these thoughts are real or are you being too critical of yourself. Challenge yourself to find alternate perspectives around this situation if possible.
5. Practice self-care: Take time to reflect on what is happening around you and what you can do to take care of yourself better. It can be mental and physical actions where you eat/sleep well, engaging in hobbies you enjoy or being good to yourself because you deserve to be treated well.
6. Seek support: Do reach out to trusted family or friends to talk about how you are feeling. Talking through experiences helps to gain new perspectives and insights. It could be encouraging as well.
If you are thinking about seeking professional support, you may consider community services or polyclinics referrals. Here are some community platforms you can consider:

Thanks for sharing more details with us. It sounds like your job is mentally stressful since critical incidents can happen anytime. I hope in this stressful environment, you have a supportive team who can be there if you need help. I hear how concerned you are if there are times when you are unsure of how to respond; I am wondering during such times, are you able to rely on your teammates for support?
It is helpful to want to be trained and experienced so you can help people. It also helps to know that we cannot be good all the time or in every aspect, thus it requires a team to make things work. Trying to do things all on your own could possibly be adding more stress to you, and perhaps might hinder your work as well. You may consider a plan B by identifying your limits (when to ask for help) and knowing who you can go to for support.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feelings here on this platform. I think it takes a lot of courage to be so vulnerable here, and I want to affirm your feelings - they are all valid and important to share.
It sounds like you are not coping well with Poly since you joined. I wonder if you experience such emotions in previous education settings as well. It also seems like you started with great expectations of yourself, and have been coping by managing these expectations. Sometimes, it takes time for people to adjust to different environment so do be patient with yourself in this journey.
Having poor focus in school can be due to feeling overwhelmed, lack of direction or other distractions. It can feel frustrating and upsetting, maybe that’s why you felt triggered by others’ actions. Here are some ways you may consider trying:
2. Identify your triggers. Think about what triggers and distracts you. What is the primary issue that is causing you to feel upset. Are there anything you can do about these triggers like sitting further from people whom you know can make distracting noises. Reflect on your past experiences. Were there situations when you felt triggered, what contributed to those feelings and how you coped with it then.
3. Journaling. Track your reactions when you feel strong emotions or engage in certain behaviours. What was going on at that time, note your thoughts and emotions. Writing these down could help allow you to reflect on them more deeply. This can possibly help you gain insight or new perspectives to the situation.
4. Self-care. Eat and sleep well. Having a balanced diet and being well-rested contributes to regulating mood and improving cognitive function. Take some time to engage in activities you enjoy , talking to people, exercising or meditation.
5. Positive self-talk: It is important how you speak to yourself. We cannot control what others tell us but we are in control of what we say to ourselves. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself.
Perhaps you can also take some time to revisit your goals as it sound like you are feeling a little lost. It is helpful to reassess goals periodically to ensure that they are aligned with your current situation and circumstances. Given that you are feeling discouraged at this point, think about what else you can do under such circumstances.
Do also think about your strengths and what have kept you going thus far. I believe you have lots of positive qualities and abilities; and you need to focus more on that. From your sharing, it sounds like you are looking at yourself in a negative light and that will further discourage you. You are still seeking different ways to cope with your difficulties, and you have not given up even though it has been really challenging. I think this is something you really need to affirm yourself for.
Meanwhile, I wonder if you have someone you can reach out to for support. It can be anyone; family, friends, or a professional to share what you are going through. Perhaps they can provide some new insight, perspective to your situation or guidance to help you navigate these obstacles. You may consider speaking with a school counsellor from your Poly as well.
Here are some additional resources for you to consider, it may help you to manage these overwhelming feelings:
2. Have self-compassion - https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=love_yourself

I agree that being an introvert can be causing you some difficulties in coping with life after secondary school. This is especially because you are expected to take charge of your learning. As such, how you participate in class plays a vital role in shaping your learning. Though class participation is taken into account, you don’t really need to be worried too much, as I have been often told that it affects your grades very minimally. You should be worried should you not be able to score well in your assignments, and tests totally. Otherwise, keep calm and try to participate in class as simple as paying attention to the tutor as he/she goes through the content in class. You won’t believe me, but I have often been the only one listening to the teacher while others were busy using their phones!

Typical case of exam stress, I guess. For this I suggest you practise past year papers (if possible) as they can help you simulate exam conditions. You can even do them when you are at school. You can possibly use a vacant tutorial room to help you simulate the exam conditions. this can help you feel more comfortable in the test environment and can possibly help you cope with the test anxiety.

11739,Insomnia Anxiety,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/insomnia-anxiety/11739,Mental Health Conditions,anxiety,7296,CoolBreeze,Professional,Professional,17536,2,"Dear @Sha90
Firstly, thank you so much for reaching out and sharing your challenges with us. I appreciate your trust. Not being able to sleep, especially during pregnancy can make things feel a whole lot more unpleasant. It’s understandable that you would feel some anxiety over it considering that it’s a sudden onset in the last week.
If you’re comfortable, could you please share if anything unusual happened before last week? You mentioned feeling scared, would it be okay for you to share more about what feels scary? Also, how many hours of sleep in total, are you able to get?
It is normal to experience some amount of insomnia during pregnancy. Pregnancy-related insomnia can occur due to various reasons like fluctuations in hormones, physical discomforts, anxiety, and stress. Please inform your gynae of your insomnia at your next medical check-up. Your doctor can assess if there are any specific factors related to your pregnancy contributing to your sleep difficulties, and offer appropriate guidance or referrals.
In the meantime, here are some suggestions for you to consider:
⁠Bedtime routine: This can be helpful to signal to our body it’s time to sleep. A mom once shared that getting into a routine of applying lotion/oil to stretch mark-prone areas was soothing before bed. Another found listening to pregnancy/labor affirmations was helpful. Some read a few pages of a storybook aloud and bonded with their baby. These are some pregnancy-related ideas. Please create a routine that brings a smile and gives you comfort.
- Limit screen time/device usage at least an hour before bed as the blue light emitted may disrupt the cues to the body that it’s time to sleep.
⁠Create a relaxing environment: Make your bedroom conducive to sleep by keeping it cool, dark, and noise-free. Consider using a sound machine or calming music to drown out any external noises or silences that might be triggering your anxiety.
⁠Practice relaxation techniques: When you notice the onset of sensations of feeling scared or your heartbeat beginning to go faster. Take a deep breath in and then exhale longer. For example, take a deep breath in, see how many counts you can breathe in till your lungs feel full (e.g. 4 counts,) then exhale longer (e.g. Try taking 2-3 counts (6) longer to exhale). Please go at a pace that is comfortable for you and listen to the wisdom of your body. Before beginning any new practices please check with your doctor.
- If doing calming breaths doesn’t resonate with you. That’s okay, you can try humming. Gently hum to a song that you like or just hum and make your own creation. The gentle vibrations of our throat can also help calm our nervous system.
- Bilateral tapping, also known as the Butterfly Hug.
2. Find a Comfortable Position: Sit or stand comfortably in a quiet and calm environment. You can also do this technique while lying down if that’s more comfortable for you.
3. Cross Your Arms: Cross your arms so that your right hand is resting on your left shoulder and your left hand is resting on your right shoulder. Your hands should be touching your upper arms, creating a butterfly-like position.
4. Start Tapping: Begin tapping lightly on your shoulders with your fingertips in an alternating pattern. For example, tap your right shoulder with your left hand, then tap your left shoulder with your right hand. Continue this alternating tapping motion.
5. Focus on Your Breath: As you tap, focus on taking slow, deep breaths. Inhale through your nose, hold for a moment, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this breathing pattern throughout the tapping exercise.
6. Engage Your Senses: While tapping and breathing, you can also engage your senses by noticing your surroundings. Pay attention to the sounds, sights, smells, and sensations around you without judgment.
7. Continue for Several Minutes: Continue tapping and breathing for several minutes or until you feel a sense of calm and relaxation. You can adjust the speed and intensity of the tapping based on what feels comfortable for you.
I hope the above are helpful for you and if you notice that things aren’t getting better, please reach out for professional help. A counsellor that works with pregnant moms may be better skilled to tailor a support plan suited to your unique needs. You’re always welcome to reach out to us if you’d like more support. Please take good care of yourself and the little one within you. I hope you find relief soon.
Wishing you a safe and comfortable pregnancy journey ahead!

Firstly, I want to thank you for sharing with us your struggles, and it sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden right now. It takes a lot of courage to express these feelings, and I want you to know that your experiences are valid.
Do know that everyone makes mistakes, you are not judged by that one mistake. There are other aspects of you that people would appreciate about you. It is okay to feel bad as these emotions come after we did something that we feel are hurtful. It is helpful to know that you acknowledged your mistakes and you are learning from it; and also trying to make things better. I see you have good intentions, wanting to care for others, that’s why you did certain things.
Remind yourself that dwelling on guilt and shame will not help you move on, instead you will keep feeling stuck and get more frustrated. Perhaps you can think about what can be done to rectify and make things better.
I am also sorry to hear that you have not got to experience genuine connections with anyone. Since you have reflected on that, I would like you to think about connecting with yourself first. Think about how comfortable are you with yourself and whether you are kind to yourself. You may consider the following options:
2. Self-compassion: Be kind and compassionate toward yourself. While you might feel that it is hard to forgive yourself for certain actions, I hope you try to show some compassion and understanding towards yourself. You have good intentions, just that it did not turn out the way you hope. It is not your fault at all, please don’t blame yourself for that. It is important how you speak to yourself. Focus more on your strengths and give affirmations to yourself.
3. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be helpful to process and release emotions. You don’t have to share this with anyone; it’s for your own self-reflection.
4. Challenge negative thoughts: Identify what are some thoughts that pull you down and make you feel bad about yourself. Think about whether these thoughts are real or are you being too critical of yourself. Challenge yourself to find alternate perspectives around this situation if possible.
5. Practice self-care: Take time to reflect on what is happening around you and what you can do to take care of yourself better. When you are feeling down, it is most helpful to take care of yourself. Like when you are physically unwell, you would rest more. It is the same with being emotionally unwell.
6. Seek support: Do reach out to trusted family or friends to talk about how you are feeling. Talking through experiences helps to gain new perspectives and insights. It could be encouraging as well.
Remember you are not alone in this journey. There are people who can support you. Please keep us updated on how you’re coping. Hear from you soon.",,1,,17508,,17508.0,

Some context: we are both avid gamers that met through a dating app and got into our relationship really fast (around 1 month after meeting). The games she plays are usually shooter games which have an overwhelming male population and regularly plays with guys in her online friend groups.
Recently she has found a new group of guys to play games with and spends some nights playing the game until 4am. I play the game with her sometimes but I am not very good at it and I have work on weekdays so I usually go to sleep at 12am.
I feel jealous as I am not capable of “carrying” her in the game, while this new group of guys are much better and can give her a better gaming experience than I can. I am also jealous that she is spending so much time with guys she doesn’t know anything about.
A few weeks ago I confronted her about the 4am thing as i know she was playing with them, but she lied about it and said it wasn’t her, only to admit it was her after a while which made me really sad about it.
I know my jealousy is a problem, and i admit i have done some spying on her texts with them and found out that it can be more or less in the territory of being “overly friendly” with these guys. I am worried because in my view, a guy who approach girls and prolong the conversation are not looking for a friendship but rather something more.
I do have some worry from the past as we had a long distance relationship for 5 months last year as I went to study in America. During that time, I felt like I wasn’t a boyfriend as she spent more time with one of her male friends playing games, while i was made to wait for my turn to call her. This was often around 3am singapore time, and rather than having a conversation it was usually just listening to her sleep because she is too exhausted to talk. However we have talked about this topic and it is now behind us.
Point is, i need help with controlling my emotions, jealousy, and tendency to spy on her texts (which i admit is a big big problem that i shouldn’t be doing). I recognize it is going to harm my relationship with her but what should I do about it?",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us and I think it is very brave of you to admit that you have such feelings and reaching out for support. It sounds like you feel strongly against your actions but it seems difficult to not spy on her texts as you really want to hold on to this relationship. I want to tell you that you are not a bad person for doing this; I see that this relationship is very important to you, thus leading to these actions. Of course, I agree with you that you probably should not be doing it as it could lead to bigger problems. Let’s explore different ways to work around this.
Firstly, it was helpful that you talked to her about your feelings in the past when you were overseas. It sounds like you talked to her this time as well, about her spending too much time gaming. I wonder how did the conversation go and how was your approach with her.
You may consider an open communication approach when talking about the issue:
2. Express yourself honestly. Share your feelings and opinions with her so she knows how you are feeling. Try not to assume people know what you are feeling as everyone can experience the same situation but feels differently due to their different values and beliefs. Let her know of your concern and how important this relationship is to you, how you feel about not being able to support her in the gaming experience.
3. Use “I’ statements. Start with saying “I feel (feelings) when (something) happens”. Instead of saying ""You make me feel (feelings) …”. This gives more ownership of your feelings without blaming the other party.
4. Manage your expectations. Know that she might disagree with some things your shared and avoid imposing your thoughts on her. See if you both can explore a middle ground regarding this issue.
5. Focus on solution. Think about your intentions of doing this. You want to improve your relationship, not to drift further apart. Use this as a common goal to work together with her.
You are her partner, so remember that you both are doing this together. Raising arguments about this will make you see each other as opposing parties, that would not be helpful during the conversations.
It can be difficult when there are opposing views in a relationship. It takes effort, time and commitment to make a relationship last. I think you are really trying to make things work by thinking about it and reaching out for support. That is a good start already! Do affirm yourself for the effort!

Thanks for your advice.
I have spoken to her about spending too much time with other guys in the past and she told me she holds no romantic feelings for them and only views them as friends.
I guess i am just jealous that (from what i have seen while spying) she is putting in an effort to seem cute to this new bunch of guys when texting. I know that spying is not right but if possible i just want to bury it all behind in the past, stop myself from spying, and never speak of it as if it has never happened in the first place. Does this make me a bad person?
I am also worried that i may come across as controlling if i talk to her about it now as this thing has been a constant issue for a long time. I know its unhealthy to want her to stop talking to other guys but i cant help but feel this way. Do you have any tips on how i can help myself to stop feeling this way?

Firstly, you have to stop thinking about yourself as a bad person. People make mistakes and what is important is not repeating those mistakes. I think you understand yourself good enough to know what you need to do to make yourself feel better.
Also, it seemed like you are worried about coming across as controlling as you really want her to hear thoughts but do not want the conversation to end badly. You may want to calm yourself first before having that conversation, so you do not get emotional. Use the open communication ways to express your feelings. Offer replacement activities if you want her to decrease her gaming time. You can think of activities you both enjoy so it brings the relationship closer.
It is also important for you to trust yourself, trust her and trust the relationship. When you are able to trust her and yourself more, you might find yourself thinking less about her interactions with others.

Thank you for reaching out for support. We appreciate you bravely sharing with us your fears of public transport. Panic attacks are very uncomfortable sensations to experience. It’s understandable that they can feel overwhelming and paralysing, leading to feelings of frustration, anger, and fear. Kudos to you for your resilience in resolving this.
Before I share more on some possible common strategies. I’d like to highlight that there are different levels of intervention for addressing panic attacks and fears. Getting help from a trained professional will enable you to experience therapeutic support as you deal with the discomforts of facing your fears. Also, the trained professional will be able to uncover with you possible root causes for the panic attack and thereby tailoring a treatment plan best suited to your needs. Whilst logically we may know there is nothing to be afraid however that same message isn’t being felt in our body hence, we experience uncomfortable sensations in our body whenever triggered. Fear is one of our body’s ways of signaling to us “Hey I’m not feeling okay, I need connection, and help to feel safe again”.
Generally, the first few steps of addressing panic attacks are to build safety in the body again. Here are some coping strategies that may help you manage panic attacks, particularly related to your fear of public transport and crowded spaces:
2. Deep Breathing and Relaxation Techniques: Practice deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and body outside of a triggering moment. This can help build a sense of familiarity and safety in your body. Thereafter during moments of panic. Focus on slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.
4-7-8 Breathing (Relaxing Breath): This technique is known for its calming effects and can help reduce anxiety. Here’s how to practice it:
- Inhale quietly through your nose for a count of 4 seconds.
- Hold your breath for a count of 7 seconds.
- Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth for a count of 8 seconds.
- Repeat the cycle for a few rounds, maintaining a steady and relaxed pace.
Box Breathing (Square Breathing): This technique helps to regulate breathing and promote a sense of calmness. Follow these steps:
- Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of 4 seconds, imagining tracing one side of a square.
- Hold your breath for 4 seconds, imagining moving along the top of the square.
- Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth for 4 seconds, tracing the opposite side of the square.
- Hold your breath for 4 seconds, completing the square.
- Repeat the pattern for several cycles, focusing on smooth and controlled breathing.
You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then release different muscle groups to reduce physical tension.
3. ** Grounding Techniques:** Grounding techniques, such as noticing and describing your surroundings or using sensory objects like a stress ball or textured item, can help anchor you in the present and reduce anxiety. Here are some grounding techniques for you to try out and see which one resonates with you the most. Similarly practice these outside of a triggering moment regularly and then use them again when you notice the onset of a panic attack.
5 Senses: Focus on your senses by naming five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
Rainbow: Find 2 things of each colour in the rainbow in your surroundings.
Alphabet: Find 1 thing of any 10 letters in the alphabet in your surroundings. Or find things that begin with the letters in your name. (If you really can’t find things for some letters, it’s okay to imagine the thing: For example Z, - imagine a Zebra)
4. Gradual Exposure Therapy: Consider working with a therapist trained in exposure therapy to gradually desensitise yourself to your fear triggers. Start by exposing yourself to smaller anxiety-provoking situations related to public transport or crowds, and gradually increase exposure as you build confidence.
5. Seek Support: Please reach out to friends, family, or a support group for understanding and encouragement. Talking about your experiences can reduce feelings of isolation and provide valuable insights and support.
Overcoming panic attacks takes time and effort, and it’s okay to seek professional help to get quality and trained support. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you work towards managing and eventually overcoming your fears.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are valid and you matter!

Thank you for taking the time to courageously share with us some of the challenges you’ve been facing. We value your trust. I’m sorry to hear about the loss of your father-in-law and the unexpected passing of your brother whilst still in the mourning phase. Having to bear the loss of two family members at the same time is incredibly difficult. Given these circumstances, it’s understandable that you’re experiencing a lot of distress and physical symptoms. I’m glad to hear that you sought medical attention and that your tests have shown you’re physically healthy.
Experiencing significant losses in a short period can trigger a range of emotional and physical reactions, such as stress, heart palpitations, shaky hands, chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and difficulty sleeping. These are all normal responses to such challenging circumstances. Anxiety and bodily discomforts are one of the ways our body signals to us that “Hey I’m not feeling okay, I need attention and connection.”
Here are three actionable steps you can consider to help cope with your grief and the challenges you’re facing:
2. Seek Professional Support: Consider scheduling regular sessions with a grief counsellor or therapist. They can provide a safe space for you to express your feelings, offer guidance on coping strategies, and help you navigate the grieving process. Don’t hesitate to reach out for professional support—it can make a significant difference in your healing journey.
3. Establish a Self-Care Routine: Dedicate time each day to engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being. This could include mindfulness exercises, gentle physical activity like walking or yoga, journaling your thoughts and feelings, or enjoying hobbies that bring you joy. Taking care of yourself emotionally and physically is crucial during times of grief.
4. Connect with Supportive Networks: Lean on your support system of family, friends, or community groups. Sharing your experiences and emotions with trusted individuals can provide comfort and a sense of connection. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or talk about your concerns regarding the future and your children. Building a strong support network can help alleviate feelings of isolation and provide practical assistance when needed.
Regarding your concerns about the future and your children, it’s natural to worry about what lies ahead, especially after experiencing loss. Focusing on the present moment and creating a supportive environment for yourself and your children can be helpful. Engaging in activities together, talking openly about feelings, and seeking support from friends and family can contribute to a sense of stability and security.
Healing takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. Please be kind to yourself and allow yourself to grieve in your own way and at your own pace.
I hope the above has been helpful and if you’d like more resources or if there is anything else you’d like to share with us, please do. We’re here to listen to you, your feelings are vailed and you matter!

10137,I really don’t know,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-really-dont-know/10137,Is This Normal?,---,7750,Shazi,User,,15302,1,"I’ve got a lot of questions.
I just started polytechnic. When I’m at poly, I’m this cheerful ambivert who takes charge of a situation with such confidence, I’d be jealous of myself. I start conversations, smile at people and laugh a lot. When I am near home, there’s like a switch to my whole being. I grow numb and just feel…dead. When people say home sweet home, I don’t agree. Sure, I laugh with my family members, but I don’t feel it. My tongue feels slimy when I say I love you to my parents. I would go as far to say that it’s torture to exist. My sister says it gets better, however, after 3 years, I’m still waiting. I don’t know how much more I can take at this point. What am I feeling? Why am I not feeling?
There are moments where I feel like I’m genuinely going insane. I want to talk to someone but there’s no one. My parents don’t believe in feelings like these and my siblings are fighting their own demons. I don’t know how to help myself.
I’m sorry, was this a lot?",,1,,,,,

Thank you for being so open in sharing your concerns. It sounds there is a lot going on at home for you and your siblings. Although, I am glad to hear that you are able to find connections and be happy when you are in poly.
It can be challenging when your parents are unable to understand and validate your emotions. I would like to offer some notes for you to think about and apply what you feel is helpful.
Manage expectations: Your parents might not be aware of how to recognise or acknowledge their own feelings, thus unable to provide this to you and your siblings. It is important to manage your expectations when you are around them. If possible, seek validation elsewhere. It can be through friends or other connections.
Self-validation: Remind yourself that your feelings are valid whether people acknowledge them or not. Give yourself time to process each emotion that you feel and let yourself know that it is okay to feel this way. It is okay to feel more like yourself outside, as compared to when you are home. Even though people can say home is a safe space, it is not necessary a safe space for everyone. You don’t have to force yourself to feel happy when you are home. That would be denying your own emotions and not fair to yourself.
Focus on self: Know that you are important and prioritise your needs. If you feel that it is better to take a break outside when things are difficult at home, take a walk in your neighbourhood. Tell yourself there is nothing wrong with thinking this way.
Seeking professional support: You can consider community options or talking to your school counsellor about what you are going through. Perhaps they can provide some guidance or tools to help you navigate these feelings.
If you are uncomfortable with seeing a school counsellor, here are some other options for you to consider:

Due to my childhood, i am currently very introverted i rarely talk to anyone, im unable to make friends, but i do make friends sometimes but they tend to forget me because i rarely hang out with them. i get anxious when im outside surrounded by a lot of people, i tend to shiver, my hands shake uncontrollably and sometimes my breath quickens. i also find many things boring especially the things i loved doing. i can’t focus on my classwork . Last year during o lvls we shifted houses it was quite close to the dates of the exams and during that time period two my grandpa died around feburary. and there was another family death very close to my exams or it was during that period. that year i also decided to be crazy and get a bf, he was very sweet and all but my parents dont approve of me dating anyone till i completed my studies, they found out about it like a few days before my exams and scolded me a lot, they also gave me the cold shoulder and avoided talkong to me. all these events put me in a place i didnt want to be in, i was very sad because of the deaths, then my parents avoided me. it put me into immense pressure and i didn’t do quite well in my English and chem. i still passed but they said its not good enough and that led me to think i was a disgrace then i slowly swept away into the sea of darkness i couldn’t think straight, i felt emotionless for quite a bit and still am. I stopped caring much about my body i tend to eat less and sometimes even skip meals. I have trouble sleeping from all the events last year…and…i have multiple thoughts about…um…self harming and i might have attempted it once…but my parents didnt know about any of this…and they call me having anxiety a joke and they think my Un comforts and my stress is invalid.

Thank you for trusting us with your story. It takes courage to open up about such painful experiences. You’ve faced numerous challenges, from feeling controlled by your parents to grappling with anxiety and other emotional difficulties. It must have been incredibly tough dealing with the loss of family members and the stress of a national exam all at once. Please know that your feelings are valid, and you deserve support and understanding. You matter!
Considering what you’ve shared, seeking help from a professional could greatly benefit you. A counsellor can offer a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your emotions, learn coping strategies, and work through past trauma. They can also help you strengthen your resilience and develop healthy ways to manage stress and anxiety. I recommend reaching out to your school counsellor for immediate support. They can guide you on the next steps towards feeling better sooner.
Remember, you’re not alone, and it’s perfectly okay to ask for help. Your well-being matters, and seeking support is a positive and empowering decision. Listed below are a few resources you might find helpful.
Take care and best wishes!

When it comes to relationship, the number one thing is always gonna be loving yourself. It works the same with all relationships, parents/family/friends/life partners/etcetc. I truly believe only when we love ourselves, do we have the capacity to love others and for others to love us for who we are. Otherwise the other ppl in our lives won’t be able to appreciate the real us, so the relationships will always seem to fail
Exploring your own strengths, identifying what you enjoy, loving your own qualities both good and bad, reflecting on your actions and learning to be better version of yourself each day. these are ways I learn to love myself more and more.
Would you considering working on these? I know it’s hard, but at least it warrants some results that will be yours to keep and won’t be easily taken away from you~",,1,,,,,
11700,Feeling lost,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/feeling-lost/11700,Mental Health Conditions,---,7296,CoolBreeze,Professional,Professional,17477,3,"Dear @Hersha1414
Thank you for coming onto this platform and sharing with us about your hurt. It sounds like you’ve been through some painful experiences and it’s natural to seek solace in various ways during such moments of difficulty. Coping with rejection is never easy. Sometimes, casual relationships like friends-with-benefits (FWB) or no-strings-attached (NSA) arrangements may seem like a solution, yet they often fail to offer the emotional support or healing we truly seek.
Such relationships can sometimes lead to feelings of emptiness or exacerbate emotional pain, particularly when they don’t fulfill our deeper needs for genuine connection and stability. Our need for connection and stability is biological; it requires time and energy to cultivate the skills needed to have deeper and more meaningful connections with others.
I invite you to consider the following for your next steps as you navigate through these challenges:
Reflect and Identify Needs: Take some time to reflect on what you truly need in terms of emotional support and connection. Identify your deeper needs and desires beyond temporary comfort.
Establish Healthy Boundaries: Evaluate your current relationships, including FWB or NSA arrangements, and set clear boundaries that align with your emotional well-being and values.
Engage in Self-Care: Invest time and effort in self-care activities that nurture your mental, emotional, and physical health. This could include exercise, hobbies, mindfulness practices, or spending time with supportive friends and family.
Practice Self-Compassion: Be kind and compassionate towards yourself. Acknowledge that it’s okay to make mistakes and experience challenges. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer to a friend in a similar situation.
Seek Professional Support: Consider reaching out to a counsellor or mental health professional who can provide you with guidance, tools, and coping strategies to navigate your emotions and relationships more effectively.
Taking proactive steps towards self-awareness, seeking support, and nurturing healthy relationships can contribute to your overall well-being and emotional fulfillment. You deserve to build a life that brings you joy, satisfaction, and genuine connections.
Please take care of yourself and I hope you will prioritise your emotional health too.
Wishing you the very best.

Cool Breeze =)

I’m sorry to hear that you received unpleasant news about your health while also facing challenges on the work front. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed and demotivated when facing health issues and work-related stress. Thank you for trusting this platform to share your feelings with us. Your emotions are valid, and you matter.
If you feel comfortable, please feel free to share more about what you’re going through. It’s common to experience a period of low mood after receiving difficult news. With support and guidance, we can help steer ourselves back into feeling better. May I please invite you to consider the following to help you navigate through this difficult period:
Acknowledge Your Feelings: It’s important to acknowledge and accept your feelings of depression, stress, and worry. Recognising and validating your emotions is the first step towards addressing them.
Reach Out for Support: Consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about what you’re going through. Sharing your feelings with someone supportive can provide comfort and perspective.
Explore Healthy Outlets: Find healthy outlets for expressing and processing your emotions, such as journaling, creative activities, or talking to a support group.
Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine. Mindfulness techniques can help you stay present, reduce anxiety, and improve your overall well-being.
Break Tasks into Manageable Steps: If work feels overwhelming, break tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Set realistic goals for yourself and celebrate small achievements along the way.
Seek Professional Help: Consider reaching out to a healthcare professional or therapist for support. They can offer guidance, coping strategies, and tools to effectively manage your depression, anxiety, and stress. If you find that your low mood and lack of interest in daily activities persist for more than two weeks, it’s important to seek professional support promptly. Early intervention can lead to more effective and timely assistance.
Please know that it’s okay to ask for help. You don’t have to navigate these challenges alone. Taking proactive steps towards self-care and seeking support can make a significant difference in managing your mood, stress, and overall well-being.
Please take care of yourself and wishing you the very best!

11689,loneliness and anxiety,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/loneliness-and-anxiety/11689,Mental Health Conditions,---,8929,Raindrop,Professional,Professional,17458,2,"Hi @isabelle09
Thanks for coming on this platform and to share about what you are currently going through. I am so sorry to hear about your grandmother’s and uncle’s passing. In addition to that, it must have been difficult for you to go through the loss of your friendships and having to deal with betrayal from a best friend can be really painful as well. It sounds really hard for you to handle all these losses that came together. I wonder how you have been coping with it since and is there someone you can talk to about it as well.
For now, let’s try to take a step at a time to address your feelings. Perhaps, we can look at how we can work around the grief process of losing your family first.
2. Take care of yourself. I understand it is hard because of the overwhelming and intense feelings but know that grieving can take a toll on your mental and physical state. So, it is most important that you pay attention to your needs at this point. Eat and rest well, try to find activities to engage yourself with.
3. Talk to people. It can be a trusted family member or a friend outside of school. You may also consider talking to a professional such as a school counsellor or reaching out to community support services. Talking helps to process your feelings and you might find a sense of relief within as well.
4. Acknowledge and validate your feelings. Whether it is sadness, anger, or confusion. Allow yourself to feel and process these emotions. It is normal to feel such emotions when you are going through tough times like this.
5. Find meaning and purpose in your life. Take time to reflect on what gives your life purpose, what values and beliefs that you identify with. Set goals that align with your values to give yourself a direction. Cultivate relationships with positive connections, people who make you feel good about yourself.
I can see that all these experiences might have impacted you and possibly made you developed a sense of fear towards building relationships, friendships as you do not want to be hurt again. It is not easy, and I hope you be patient with yourself during this process.
I am also concerned about what you said about possibly hurting yourself and I want to make sure that you are okay. It takes a lot of courage to deal with what you have been through and I hope your prioritise your body and wellbeing as you journey through this. Always remember to be kind and compassionate toward yourself.
I hope you are able to cope with ways that are helpful and not hurtful to yourself. Here are some suggestions for you to consider trying:
- Deep breathing exercises – Find a comfortable space and position yourself comfortably. Take a deep breath in while counting to 5 and breathe out counting to 5 as well. While you are breathing out, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Stay focused on your breathing and cast aside other thoughts. Repeat until you feel better.
- Grounding exercises – A five-step exercise (5-4-3-2-1) can help to ground you in the present when you are feeling anxious.
You would need to engage your 5 senses (like 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can smell, 2 things you can hear, 1 thing you can taste).
- Physical activity – It can be to walk around, jump a little, anything to release any pent-up energy within yourself.
- Mindfulness meditation - Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment without judgment. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. You can start by trying simple mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing or guided meditation (easily available on YouTube), to help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Check out Balance Yourself
- Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be helpful to process and release emotions. You don’t have to share this with anyone; it’s for your own self-reflection. You can also try to declutter your mind through this simple activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Remember that you don’t have to face this alone, and I really hope you get the support you need through this challenging time. You may also consider making an appointment with your school counsellor or consult with an external professional to talk it out.

Been a whirlwind since the start of 2024. My wife says she lost feelings for me. And later admitted that she has been talking to another guy. They are not involved physically and it’s purely one-sided on her end. I have been trying to “win” her back but has not made any progress. She is fixated on separation / divorce. She is not willing to work things through with me. We have a kid who is turning 2 soon.
Just last night I have decided to let go after doing everything that I could. I am now mentally preparing myself for the separation / divorce even though I am unwilling.
It’s been awhile since I experienced happiness. I am no longer motivated in anything I do, be it my job or my hobbies.
I don’t think I’m suicidal, but I don’t feel like there is much meaning in life.
How do I know if I am depressed? What are the signs? And how can I seek help to improve my mood?",,0,,,,,

I am so sorry to hear about what you have been going through. It must be heartbreaking to hear your partner saying that she has lost feelings for you after all that you both have been through. And it must have taken a lot of strength and courage for you to make the decision to let go.
At this moment, it must be overwhelming for you as you go through a range of emotions. Going through a loss in relationship is not easy and it takes time to process. I hope you allow yourself to process your emotions and be compassionate with yourself during this period. It is okay to take a step at a time or even take a break from work to attend to your needs.
If you are concerned about going into depression, here are some signs and symptoms you need to take note of:
Persistent Sadness : Feeling overwhelmingly sad for an extended period.
Loss of Interest : Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed.
Fatigue : Experiencing a lack of energy and feeling tired most of the time.
Sleep Disturbances : Changes in sleep patterns, including insomnia or excessive sleep.
Appetite Changes : Significant weight loss or gain due to changes in appetite.
Difficulty Concentrating : Struggling to focus or make decisions.
Feelings of Guilt or Worthlessness : An overwhelming sense of self-blame or inadequacy.
Physical Ailments : Unexplained physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches.
Social Withdrawal : Isolating from friends, family, and social activities.
Thoughts of Self-Harm : Any mention or thoughts of self-harm or suicide must be taken seriously.
It would be helpful to surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can offer a listening ear and emotional support. If you are open to seeing a professional, here are some options you can consider:

- Exercising might be helpful in improving your mood and help you rest better

I am sorry to hear that you are going through this as well. Dealing with betrayal and loss is never easy, it is very painful and takes time to process. Do be patient and kind to yourself as you work this through.
Perhaps you can identify your feelings as you are processing your grief. Grief process comes in different stages, here is a quick summary and you may read up more on your own too.
2. Denial – usually the initial stage of grief. Where one experiences shock and disbelief. Sometimes denial is the way people cope as it can be difficult to accept what happened due to overwhelming emotions. Take time to reflect on this and ask questions for clarity.
3. Anger – this is when the reality sets in and one might feel anger and resentment towards the other party for hurting them. They could be consumed by the anger which creates intrusive thoughts to direct the anger to themselves, others or to the ones who hurt them. This is a natural process as they are hurt, thus such intense emotions come up. Sometimes, people feel bad for being angry. But do remember that it is okay to feel angry and to acknowledge this as part of the grief process and slowly work through it.
4. Bargaining – sometimes when the reality hits too hard, people start thinking about what they can do to improve the situation. Like whether they can salvage or try to negotiate with the loss. It can be helpful to weigh what is realistic or not, and explore what else can be done within their control.
5. Depression – this is when feelings of sadness or hopelessness set in and people might withdraw themselves from their usual routine or distance themselves from others. Do seek support from close friends or family members during this period. While it is difficult, try to establish a routine and get out of the house more. Engage in activities that is brings release of tension (exercising) or brings positive feelings (hobbies, activities that one enjoys).
6. Acceptance – when people slowly accept the fact that things cannot be changed and that they have to move on. This would be a time when they find ways to seek closure.
Know that this process is not linear and people may bounce back and forth; different people take different amounts of time to process this. It is important to seek connection and emotion support during such challenging times to navigate the process easier.
Take care of yourself. I understand it is hard because of the overwhelming and intense feelings but know that grieving can take a toll on your mental and physical state. So, it is most important that you pay attention to your needs at this point. Eat and rest well, try to find activities to engage yourself with or make plans with people.
I hope you get to work around this and do remember to seek support when you need!
Please take care.",,0,,17401,,17401.0,

I’m an introvert but I’ve been kinda forced to take on the “extroverted” role because the people around me won’t start conversations (which may not be that bad but it’s annoying for classwork and projects). This leads me to feeling burned out and tired after class - and now I have this image of being super talkative and excited which puts even more pressure on me to talk even when I don’t want to.
Recently I think I’ve hit my breaking point. I had been out sick for a couple of days + running CCA fiesta has led me to missing a couple of classes. TLDR; I asked for updates on assignments to do, complete silence and gotten blue-ticked. I’m team leader for a couple of modules and due dates are approaching. In the past I’ve given feedback to some of my lecturers but they essentially said it was a communication problem and it’s up to us to make do.
Often I would just end up digging through class schedules and dming lecturers to find out what to do - though I fear it might look like I don’t ask my classmates for updates and instead run to my superiors . With this radio silence I just tell myself that “maybe they were sick too” or “maybe my lecturer didn’t explain clearly” or even “maybe the work is obvious and I’m just too stupid to understand the assignment”. This kind of rationalising (or truth) had been with me since secondary school where I didn’t want to look dependent on my group or unreasonable when there were external factors that affected the group work that I didn’t know of.
But now I’ve been making the same excuses for so long that I don’t even believe them anymore - I just get even more burnt out and depressed. My family says it’s good to give the benefit of doubt and I should be patient with others, yet I’m doing it at the expense of my own mental state due to the added stress of not knowing what to submit, not knowing what’s happening in class, not knowing who I can actually depend on for group work.
I don’t know if giving them excuses means I’m rationalising their actions and choosing to look on the bright side or if I’m just gaslighting myself into believing that they aren’t bad classmates. My mind just goes on and on and it eventually ends on me being the bad person. Or maybe it’s correct and I’m just overthinking things. I’m so confused and tired and frustrated.",,1,,,,,

In my opinion, I feel that you should not really worry about being judged cos I feel that u have tried your best by reaching out to your peers and tutors. I had a similar experience whereby all my group mates were using discord to communicate and discuss abt the project, whereas I was waiting for the matter to be discussed via the official WhatsApp group. To my utter dismay, they had progressed on with the project without me and made me feel guilty at the end of the project. The best thing I could do was to try to add in my personal contribution and feedback to my tutor at the end of the project. Similarly, I feel that you have tried your best by trying your best to communicate.

As for these types of scenarios, I feel family members may not be able to know the seriousness of the matter. Especially since life after school is mainly projects and group works. Hence, if you feel your mental energy is being drained do not hesitate or feel guilty to reach out to your tutors. At least they can award you marks based on your individual contributions.

TBH, I had no friends other than a guy, whom I knew from secondary school , when I was in poly. This was not because I cannot communicate( ps. I scored As and distinctions in communication modules) but rather not anyone suited my personality. My personal advice is that you should not be pressurised of being labelled and stereotyped. I feel that you have come of your shell mainly because you chose to initiate conversations in the first place.
Another advice is that you have to embrace your personality.If you have friends beyond school, you can spend more time with them or just do something you like. This can help prevent yourself from overthinking and draining your mental energy. I learnt from a module in school, that the road to emotional wellness is like wearing oxygen masks during an aviation emergency. You have to maintain your emotional sanity before supporting others.

It sounds like you are in a tough situation making you feel rather lost and helpless at the moment. From what you shared, it seemed like you made yourself step up to take a role that you were not comfortable with and tried your best to work things out. I would like to applaud you for having such courage to do so and being committed to it though it is challenging.
It feels to me that you still want to make things right but with all the obstacles, you are questioning why you are still holding on and how to navigate around this situation. You have done what you could to reach out for support and you feel that you have reached a stage of burn-out. Perhaps you can take some time off this concern and focus on yourself.
I would like you to think about why you took on the role and what is pushing the need to uphold this image that you are “super talkative and excited”. What happens if you let go of such expectations on yourself? It sounds like people are making things difficult for you, and it seems like you are making things difficult for yourself as well. Which is probably why you are feeling tired and frustrated. People do not seem to acknowledge or recognize your concerns, and you might be pushing aside your own emotions too.
Here are some options for you to consider:
Set boundaries: Assign roles and responsibilities fairly and set deadlines for everyone. Be firm and consistent with your boundaries. If someone is not responding, try having a talk with them to understand what is going on and clarify expectations.
Identify priorities: Know what your priorities are. If you feel bad for missing classes due to other commitments, are you able to participate lesser in those commitment? Often times, people lost sight of what is important to them when other commitments seemed more urgent. When the balance is lost between your priorities and other responsibilities, there could be a tendency to blame yourself or the situation. Let’s try different ways to remove the possibility of guilt tripping yourself.
Self-care: You can be free in expressing yourself and showing others who you really are. The truth is we can never satisfy everyone and what is more important is to be satisfied with who you are. Putting up an image for the sake of others can be tiring and make you feel disconnected with yourself. When you pay attention to your needs, you might find your own answers. If this term has been too much for you, don’t be afraid to take on lesser roles during the next term so you have time to attend to things that you enjoy.
Lastly, I want to tell you that you are not a bad person. You have done so much and it would be helpful to acknowledge your own efforts too.
I hope this has been helpful. Do keep us updated on how you are coping, we would really like to continue to support you here on this platform. All the best and take care!",,0,,17276,,17276.0,

Before you even think about getting them to accept you, think about being a good conversationalist. Google how to ask good questions, ask them and just listen. Once you get the hang of having good conversations, you can start sharing more about your story - the more you share it, the easier it gets to share.
You’ll face a lot of rejections, especially at the start where people think you’re boring and stuff. But remember, it’s not just about you in the conversation, it’s about them too.

Thanks for being so genuine and courageous in reaching out and sharing your struggles with us. At the core of it, human beings are social creatures - everyone has a fundamental need for human connection, and it’s okay to seek support in fulfilling that need. So it’s completely understandable that you’re experiencing a strong need for connection and intimacy, especially given your circumstances.
One thing to keep in mind is that building relationships, especially romantic ones, can take time and patience. It’s normal to feel nervous or shy when meeting new people, especially if you’re not familiar with dating or socialising with women. Other users in this thread have already mentioned some great suggestions, and I’d like to add on some steps you can take to ease this process and increase your comfort level:
2. Explore Shared Interests: While you may have predominantly male-dominated hobbies, consider exploring activities or groups where you can meet women who share similar interests. This could be through joining clubs, classes, or social events related to your hobbies or other interests. If it’s too nervewrecking to go for these alone, you could start by asking a trusted friend to come along. The idea here is that building connections based on shared interests can help create a more natural and comfortable environment for interaction.
3. Practise Social Skills: It’s normal to feel nervous or unsure when interacting with women, especially if you’re not used to it. Consider practising social skills and conversation techniques to help build your confidence. This could involve role-playing scenarios with a friend or family member, or seeking out resources and tips online for improving social interactions.
4. Take Small Steps: Building relationships doesn’t have to happen overnight. Start by taking small steps towards meeting new people and expanding your social circle. This could involve initiating conversations with women in social settings, attending social gatherings or events, or trying online dating platforms where you can connect with others in a more relaxed environment.
5. Seek Support: Don’t hesitate to seek support from friends, family members, or a therapist who can provide guidance and encouragement as you navigate this process. A therapist can also help you explore any underlying concerns or barriers that may be impacting your ability to connect with others and provide strategies for overcoming them.
6. Focus on Self-Acceptance: Remember that it’s important to prioritise self-acceptance and self-love throughout this journey. Embracing your unique qualities and strengths plays a big part in helping you to approach social interactions with authenticity and confidence. Building healthy relationships starts with being comfortable and confident in yourself.
It’s important to be patient and gentle with yourself as you navigate this process. Building connections and relationships takes time, and it’s okay to take things at your own pace. Keep an open mind, be willing to step out of your comfort zone, and trust that meaningful connections will come in time. You deserve to experience the joy and fulfillment that comes from connecting with others, and with perseverance and self-compassion, you can achieve that.

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us on this platform. All those years of dealing with anxiety must have been tough and it takes commitment to work through it. I would like to say that I am impressed by your effort to overcoming it.
As you step into a different life stage, it is natural to feel that things are getting more challenging as you adjust to different settings and people. I wonder if you have tried your previous ways of coping with the stress and anxiety and whether it has been helpful. You are a strong person to have come so far, and I believe that you can overcome it this time too. Perhaps you feel that you require more support during this period as things are more stressful, which is okay too. I would like to suggest some resources for you to consider as well:

[https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=feel_more_control] (https://Feel More Control )
Perhaps you can share more about how you are affected by your current situation, such as daily routine, appetite and sleep habits. Also, what are some expectations that you are meeting and whether there is a way to manage these expectations, so they are more balanced and realistic.
As to whether you need medications, I am afraid I am unable to provide any advice regarding to that. However, you may consider taking an online assessment to understand your mental state and possibly help you make a better decision. (https://mindline.sg/assessment ).
You may also make an appointment with IMH and consult with a professional to get a better understanding of what is happening and what can be helpful for you.

Thank you for coming onto this space to share about your struggles. I hear you that your anxiety is getting overwhelming.
I am not a professional but based on my personal experience, I would say that there is no harm seeking help from a professional, they will be able to guide you on your next course of action.
Additionally, I would add that before you decide to take medication, it’s good to read up on those meds cause like any meds, there’s bound to be side effects and a tendency to become reliant on meds. I would say that it’s good to explore other avenues of help too like therapy before starting on meds.

Then i give myself time to recover and while i was recovering my relative found a job for me and suggests me to work and she told me people there are friendly. I give it a shot, i was having multiple difficulties but slowly i get really comfortable with my job and able to interact with my colleagues.
While working i decided to try get into the course in poly that i’m “interest"" in which is IT as a DAE Applicant in 2023 but i fail to get in.
2024 I tried again, from mid April i was convinced i wont able to get in to the course under DAE knowing it will be hard to get in and i already feel comfortable with my job and maybe i go for part-time diploma. But, i receive email from SP that got selected into the course of my “interest"" so i accepted it. Even tho i got what i want at the same time i feel sad i wont be working the job that i am feeling comfortable but i have colleagues encourage me to study and i give it a go.
So this is where the problem i have now, is that for the first 2 weeks till now in school is overwhelming, learning 2 different programing modules is exhausting and mathematics is not my favourite module and i have bad experience with it. I tried asking classmates they tried help me but i was having difficulties on understanding their guidance. I tried to self-study on things i dun understand but even i get it for some reason i feel nothing or disinterest for those weeks. I haven’t made any new friends because im introvert and the conversation they made is not something im into. At that point i ask myself why do i have go to school and feel so disinterest all the time losing focus. Even i tried do something i like doing i cant seem to be enjoying. Am i feeling depress again?",,0,,,,,

Firstly thank you for bravely sharing your feelings and experiences with us. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and I appreciate you sharing your experiences with me. I want to applaud you for being proactive in seeking recovery, trying new things like work, and not giving up even though you were not accepted the first time. Leaving your comfort zone takes great strength! Well done on starting school even though it felt scary. Please know there is nothing wrong with you and it’s normal to feel low when the situation around you isn’t what you hoped for.
I’m curious about the inverted commas you put when you mentioned ‘interest’. Does that mean that it isn’t your genuine interest or does it mean something else?
If IT is your genuine interest, then please know that the start of any new academic journey is usually filled with some discomfort. It can take up to a few months to find your footing and momentum slowly. Your uncomfortable feelings are valid. Starting school again after some time away can indeed be overwhelming, especially when faced with challenging subjects like programming and mathematics. These are subjects that are tricky for quite a lot of people (including myself) This does not mean that something is wrong with you if you don’t understand the topic now. This just means that it might take you more time to bridge the gap in your knowledge and skills in these topics. Having a growth mindset will be helpful as you learn at your pace.
May I suggest speaking to your lecturers to see how you can get the support needed to get better in these modules. Perhaps there is a student support group that you can join. I’m glad to hear that you have helpful classmates. Classmates sometimes may have the best intentions to help and they may not be good teachers because they may not have the teaching skillset needed to help you learn better. We all have different learning needs and styles and that too is okay. It is understandable to lose interest in the topics when it feels too difficult. With the right support, the interest can be slowly developed.
Sometimes the first two modules may be unpleasant and the other modules may feel easier after a while. It is also normal to be grieving the loss of your old life at work which was filled with familiarity and comforting colleagues. It makes sense that you would be experiencing low feelings as you need to develop those comforting friendships from scratch again in this new environment.
From your sharing, you sound like someone who has the resilience to continue even though you face hardship. You mentioned that your work environment was filled with multiple difficulties initially and yet you managed to overcome them slowly. Likewise, I believe you will also be able to overcome these challenges slowly. You don’t have to do it alone, you can reach out for support from lecturers, the school counselling department, or other trusted adults in your family or friends circle.
Stay in touch with your current friends that may not be in your poly to feel connected and give yourself time to develop new friendships. Poly is a great place to meet all sorts of different people, allow yourself the time and space to explore your interests via CCA or activities to find friends with similar interests.
Also, given your history of depression and schizophrenia, it’s important to pay attention to how you’re feeling. If you’re experiencing a lack of enjoyment in activities you used to like and struggling to focus, it might be helpful to reach out to your psychiatrist and mental health professional for support and guidance.
Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time and to prioritize your well-being. You’ve shown resilience in facing challenges before, and with the right support, you can navigate through this difficult period as well. You may want to practice self-compassion to help you navigate this new chapter in your life with a little more ease. I’ll share some resources below for your consideration.
I hope the above helps and wishing you the very best!

My mother has always been controlling, growing up. She would scream at me for not wearing the clothes she picked out, even if I felt they were ugly. Then the next moment, she would shower love, saying she loved me and that I was lucky to have such a “wonderful mother”.
She grew up as the youngest of many children with no father (her mother was the second wife), and I know she has an anxious attachment style, as well as abandonment issues. She also never felt loved by my father, but was always critical of him, and at times emotionally abusive.
Growing up, I tried to tell her how her actions made me feel, but she would always explode at the slightest hint that she was in the wrong. She would never apologize or acknowledge the fact that she had a bad temper, instead levelling accusations such as “how many times do I even scream at you in a week?” and “don’t I have the right to get angry?”
It was disconcerting because I could never truly distance myself from her. She would scream at me for something as small as spilling a piece of food on the table, then say “i love you!” as if nothing happened a few moments later. When I raised this up with her, she would say I needed to stop taking things so seriously
She also suffered from mental health issues and I was often her listening ear when she was down, or when she had a bad relationship with my father.
As a result, I always feel like I am walking on eggshells at home. I know she cares for me in her own way, but I always feel a need to have my guard up at home. I can never truly tell her how I am feeling as I always feel like she might explode at any given moment.
I have been able to hold this peace and pretend everything is fine with her, but lately I can’t even bring myself to talk to her without feeling deeply uncomfortable. I feel that I need to filter everything through the question: “Will this make her explode?”.
I wish I could move out, but that is not financially possible at this moment. My father usually goes along and agrees with everything she says because he knows that she must always win every argument, and it is always better to just “go along” with everything she says.
I have tried to set boundaries, but sometimes the thoughts honestly just stew, and even the sound of her voice or her footsteps can raise alarm bells in my head.
How can I deal with this situation?",,0,,,,,
11552,Complications in relationship with mum,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/complications-in-relationship-with-mum/11552,Seeking Help,---,7296,CoolBreeze,Professional,Professional,17285,2,"Hi @anonymous203
I’m so sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing at home. It must be incredibly challenging to navigate such a complex dynamic with your mother. It’s clear that her behaviour has had a significant impact on your well-being, and I want to acknowledge your strength in reaching out for support and for doing the best you can in spite of the challenging and painful circumstances.
Living in a situation where you feel like you’re walking on eggshells can be incredibly stressful and emotionally draining. It’s understandable that you would feel uncomfortable and hesitant to express your true feelings, given the unpredictable nature of your interactions with your mother. It’s even harder when the person who is hurting you (even though unintentionally) is a love one. Your feelings of fear, confusion, and helplessness are valid. I hear you!
It sounds to me that perhaps growing up in a volatile family environment you may have picked up a fawn response as a way of coping and surviving in your home. The “fawn” response is a term used in psychology and trauma literature to describe a specific type of coping mechanism or survival strategy in response to stress, conflict, or threat. The term originates from the “4Fs” model of responses to threat, which includes Fight, Flight, Freeze, and Fawn.
The fawn response can be a survival strategy that develops in response to past experiences of feeling unsafe, threatened, or invalidated. While it may help individuals navigate difficult situations or relationships in the short term, it can also lead to difficulties in setting healthy boundaries, asserting one’s own needs, and maintaining authentic connections with others.
Understanding the fawn response can be helpful, as it allows individuals to recognise patterns of behaviour that may be rooted in past trauma or learned coping mechanisms. I would like to strongly encourage you to get professional counselling support so that you can have:
2. someone safe to explore your feelings and receive validation
3. someone to brainstorm with you alternative strategies, i.e setting boundaries, assertiveness skills, self-validation techniques
4. someone to help you regulate your feelings as you enforce the consequences of the boundary not being respected.
5. Someone to remind you of your strengths and abilities
6. Someone to journey with you as you experience discomfort
I’d also like to invite you to consider the possibility of giving yourself the permission to be responsible only for your emotions and actions and not taking responsibility for your mother’s emotions and actions. It’s a series of allowing your mom to experience her discomforts without taking responsibility for it, even if she says otherwise. I acknowledge that it is really tough to do in an Asian context and my hope is that with a counsellor’s support you’ll have help at each step of the way.
Here are some possible strategies for you to try:
- Practice Detachment: Learn to detach yourself emotionally from your mother’s reactions and behaviours. This doesn’t mean ignoring or disregarding her feelings, but rather recognising that you are not responsible for managing or fixing her emotional state.
- Reflect and Evaluate: Regularly reflect on your progress and evaluate how well you’re maintaining boundaries and taking responsibility for your own emotions. Celebrate small wins and identify areas for further growth and improvement.
- Practice Self-Compassion: Remind yourself that it’s okay to prioritise your own well-being and emotional health. Practice self-compassion by acknowledging your feelings, validating your experiences, and being kind to yourself during challenging moments.
- Mindfulness and Distancing Techniques: Practice mindfulness techniques to stay present in the moment and avoid getting caught up in your mother’s emotional reactions. You can also use distancing techniques, such as imagining placing her emotions in a bubble or visualizing yourself observing the situation from a neutral perspective.
- Cultivate Emotional Independence: Focus on developing emotional independence and resilience by building a strong support network outside of your relationship with your mother. This can include friendships, hobbies, activities, and self-care practices that nurture your well-being and sense of self.
- Use Assertive Communication: Use assertive communication techniques to express your needs and boundaries clearly and respectfully. This involves using “I” statements to communicate your thoughts and feelings without blaming or accusing. For instance, “I feel overwhelmed when I’m expected to manage your emotions, and I need to focus on taking care of myself.”
- Set Boundaries: Clearly define and communicate your boundaries with your mother. This includes expressing what you are and are not responsible for in terms of emotions and actions. For example, you can say, “I understand that you may feel upset, but I can only take responsibility for how I express myself, not for how you feel.” There are many different types and levels of boundary setting. Please do this with professional support so that it can be a more comfortable process.
This process may take time and practice, especially in contexts where expectations around familial responsibilities and emotions can be strong. Please be patient with yourself, keep seeking support and allow yourself the time and space to heal at a pace comfortable to you.

sometimes parents really are also still kids themselves learning and growing, so their issues spill over to their kids…
how i feel like i will approach the situation, is to find moments where you enjoy your relationship with your family and amplify those moments, so to maintain a happy relationship. and for the other moments, hold firm on your boundaries when necessary, knowing you deserve comfort and rest in your home even if it might not be the best for those around you from time to time. it would be best if this can be done kindly, but if not, sometimes it might just have to be difficult ><
the more we hold on to our beliefs of how we can be better and stronger emotionally and mentally, the more possibly the people arnd us can learn and become better to. so maybe by influence, your mother will learn to take better care of herself as well with you living your good life as example.
i know all these are way easier said than done, and there must be so many nuances in your life that makes my comments probably inapplicable. but hopefully it sparks some ideas for how you can deal with the situation?

I tend to be hypersensitive in my interactions and think of the worst possible situations each interaction may bring, which usually ends with the thought that people may gossip / dislike / neglect me in social situations. Whenever these thoughts happen, it’s hard for me to focus on what I have to do and I tend to feel anxious and dissociate from the present. It usually only goes away until the other party proves that he/she does not “hate” me. Then, this vicious cycle repeats again as my mind tends to find things to hyperfixate and worry on.

That sounds really challenging! Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and feelings with us. It takes courage to open up about experiences with anxiety and overthinking, especially in social situations and relationships. I can only imagine how uncomfortable it must be for you to constantly experience this. Thank you for trusting us; I truly appreciate it.
First and foremost, well done on taking a step towards breaking the cycle. Having awareness and then reaching out for support is a step in the right direction.
Please know that you’re not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with similar challenges, and there are strategies that can help you cope and manage these feelings more effectively. Overthinking and anxiety can be complex. It’s usually our body’s way of trying to protect us from harm. Usually, an outdated programming that used to help us cope in the past, and now that same strategy has become unhelpful. I encourage you to reach out to a counsellor for support so that he/she can help create a customized support plan for you.
I’ll share some strategies and perspectives that have helped others, and I invite you to explore them at your pace and comfort level. We can help our brain learn new ways to keep us safe by presenting it with facts and pairing these with calming body relaxation techniques.
One approach that may be helpful is practising mindfulness. Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment without judgment. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. You can start by trying simple mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing or guided meditation (easily available on YouTube), to help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Check out Balance Yourself
If you notice your mind beginning to spiral, may I suggest trying a grounding technique? For example, use your 5 senses: find 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. Another grounding technique is using the rainbow – find at least 2 things of each colour of the rainbow in your environment. There is also box breathing. There are many different techniques to help calm your nervous system. I encourage you to try different ones and find the one that resonates with you the most, then practice it regularly so that your body learns to feel safer and calmer.
Another helpful strategy is challenging unhelpful thoughts and beliefs. You can give these thoughts a name, for example: “Judgy Mind”. When you notice yourself thinking of the worst possible outcomes or worrying about what others think of you, try to question those thoughts. Ask yourself if there’s any evidence to support these beliefs. Are there any other possible perspectives? Try to think of 3 different perspectives.
Keeping a journal can be helpful – record these thoughts, list any evidence contradicting them, and record factual outcomes after events. Over time, this strategy can give you feedback that your worst thoughts usually don’t materialise.
Another strategy is, when the thought “Oh, xyz doesn’t like me” comes up, Acknowledge it, you can say something like “oh Hi Judgy Mind, you’re here again. Let’s take a pause, I’m going to ground myself (do any of the grounding exercises or calming breath). When you notice your body is feeling calm, you can then go ahead to explore what is the evidence that xyz doesn’t like me? Are there any other possible explanations for that behaviour or action? You can also affirm yourself “My thoughts are not facts, I am safe”.
Also, another important thing is to have self-care and self-compassion. Be gentle with yourself and offer yourself kindness. You’re doing the best you can, and that is enough in that moment. Give yourself permission to grow, make mistakes, and learn new skills.
Remember, coping with anxiety and overthinking is a journey, and it takes time for our brain and body to learn new ways of coping. It’s okay to seek help and take small steps towards feeling better. You deserve to feel at ease in social situations and relationships, and with time and support, you can learn to manage these challenges more effectively.
I hope the above strategies are helpful; please do try them out and let us know how things are.

I am sorry to hear about what you went through previously that led to your journey on weight loss. It must have been a difficult period for you to make such a decision and to commit through the journey of losing weight.
While I am happy to hear of your positive outcome in losing weight, I am worried about your overall wellbeing as your body needs sufficient nutrients to grow and develop well as you are 15 years old now. I am also concerned about your diet and methods you have been engaging in this weight loss journey.
Perhaps, you can consider healthier food options and find a balance in your nutritional needs. It could be adding more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins to achieve your desirable weight while maintaining a healthy body. If necessary, you may consider consulting with a nutritionist to create a balanced diet that works for you.
Perhaps, at the start of adjusting your diet to be more balanced, there could be a slight change in weight, and it might be discouraging. Know that you have made progress, I hope you can also prioritise your overall wellbeing as much as your weight goals.
Let’s take it a step at a time. It is challenging but you are not alone. I am here to listen and to support you. Please take care and I hope things get better for you.",,0,,15301,,15301.0,

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles dealing with flashbacks; I can’t imagine how upsetting it is for you despite all the years It’s even more distressing because it came from someone you looked up too and did not expect. I wonder what situation nowadays brings up these sort of thoughts that impact your mood negatively? Are you able to notice a pattern - does it occur with certain people/place/events? I wonder what do you to help you cope after you get those thoughts?
It sounds to me what happened 7 years ago left you ‘stuck’ in that moment and perhaps you might feel unsafe nowadays when it comes to certain relationships? If you were to look behind some of the thoughts that come up - is it trying to tell you something more? Is there a need that it is not met or taken away from you? It sounds like you value the opinions that people share with you so it’s even harder with the negative things people say… and trying to break out of the flashbacks.
You mentioned self harm - when do you find yourself thinking about it or acting it out? People hurt themselves as a way once they’re unable to cope with overwhelming feelings and distressing thoughts. I hope we can find alternatives to help you cope - one of the ways to manage difficult feelings is to take a deep breath - this gives you a moment to pause to check if your thoughts (about yourself and others) are accurate and/or helpful, before considering other possibilities. Also, do allow yourself to express your emotions (instead of bottling it in), and perhaps shift to a more helpful way of taking perspective.
I also wonder if you’ve shared this with anyone? It’s great that you’re reaching out here and the community is more than willing to listen to you. Are there people that you feel comfortable with and know that can assist you - for you to reach out for support as well? And if you’re open to consider professional support, do reach out to:

I used to be a happier version of myself where i enjoy going to school, i enjoy going to the gym, i enjoy going out alone and just chill and shop by myself and i also love to socialize around. But recently ive noticed a big change in myself where i kept getting negative thoughts almost everyday and I have not been going to the gym. Everytime i am free i spent my day doing nothing and i cry most of the time for no complete reason.
I get disturbing thoughts and I cant seem to forgive myself for it. I have been feeling like the lowest state for a month.
This has been a challenge for me. I am not excited of things anymore even though there are great things happening for me in the next few months. I also tend to want to be alone instead of socializing.
Before i get all these negative and disturbing thoughts, I was trying to go on dates. And it all did not worked out so i was wondering if this has to do with my past dating. But i have no feelings towards it.
Is there a way to stop thinking negatively and stop overthinking too much. I am going insane",,2,,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to share with us on this platform about your feelings and thoughts, and I’m truly sorry to hear that you’ve been going through such a challenging time. It takes courage to open up about these feelings, and I’m here to support you.
I want to affirm your efforts of wanting to work on yourself, and that you’ve recognized these changes in yourself. It’s actually quite common to have thoughts about ourselves, wondering if we are ‘okay’ or not. I’m also wondering, if there was a specific event or situation that you think might have triggered these negative thoughts and emotions, or has it felt like a gradual change over time? (i.e. from the state of enjoying things to the sudden “big change” where you get negative thoughts and cry)
Have you considered reaching out to friends, family, or a professional to talk about what you’re going through? Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can be a helpful first step. I can imagine it might feel challenging to reach out to a professional, but there are some amazing online options that might feel less intimidating, I would encourage you to give them a try
Online chat options:

In the meantime, you could also try incorporating self-care activities into your daily routine, such as relaxation exercises, mindfulness, or engaging in hobbies that used to bring you joy. Sometimes, taking small steps towards self-compassion and self-care can make a significant difference. When you try out these activities, initially there might be a lot of ‘pushback’ - you’ll feel bored, tired or lack motivation but eventually when you keep on going, you’ll find your groove again and perhaps find your community too.
I would also like to suggest a few helpful resources which you may benefit from, especially when those negative challenging thoughts come to your mind:
- When you need to find a new perspective and challenge the negative thoughts : Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Try to meditate and focus on your internal self : Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Try decluttering your mind : Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- When things get overwhelming, try to remember to be kind to yourself: https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=be_kind
Last but not least, I highly encourage you to speak to a mental health professional - they can provide you with a safe space to process your thoughts further, and you don’t have to go through this alone, and there is hope for improvement.
Please do keep us updated on how you’re coping and what you’ve decided to do - we’d like to continue to support you here on this platform.

My friends say I have mild autism or OCD or maybe both…
Whenever I have intrusive thoughts, I start doing embarrassing things like asking my friends the weirdest questions like “hey, why are chimpanzees called chimpanzees?” And my friends would look at me like they are wondering whether something is wrong.
I also feel addicted to something… pulling my lashes out. It has been already going on for more than 3 years. I don’t know, is it because of stress? Well, at first it was but now i have no idea.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about what you’re going through with cutting and interacting with people that matter to you. It must be rather frustrating and isolating with your experience, given that it still continues. I want to let you know that what you’re thinking and feeling are valid given your circumstances.
You mentioned “not having a reason” for cutting and getting “super nervous” when expressing yourself - I wonder what goes through your mind at that time and just before it happens? What are some of the things you find yourself telling yourself, consciously or not? Perhaps, there could be a need that is not being met or got taken away? All of us have an inherent need for support, comfort, growth, etc. regardless of background or upbringing.
I also wanna commend you on your self-awareness as that’s the first step in knowing you need help. And seeking support is a step in the right direction - impossible tasks can be achieved by breaking it down to smaller components and tackling the ones that are more achievable first!
Have you spoken to anyone else you trust and can help you about this? Did something happen recently or has this been going on for awhile? Some people self-harm as a way to cope with overwhelming feelings and/or distressing thoughts. How did you use to cope when things got too much for you? And it sound like you wish to be able to cope differently as the relief you get is only temporary. I wonder if you’re able to express your feelings in other ways - or you can try to express them in a (more) helpful manner.
About your social interactions, it does sound perplexing that words don’t come out when you speak to certain people. Do you notice it happening with any particular people, like is there a pattern here? Similarly, what are some thoughts you have about yourself, or the other party or the situation just before you start to feel nervous or embarrased? This could give us an insight about working on some unhelpful thoughts or feelings to better manage the next time you find yourself in a similar situation.
While that happens, perhaps to help with the distress, you can modulate your stress levels by engaging in deep breathing and practice being kind to yourself when you’re not distressed as self-care is equally important for mental health Let us know what you think about this and if things get too overwhelming for you, do consider support from professionals that can work with you in a safe and non-judgmental setting:

I’m truly sorry to hear about these incidents that happened to you in the past and how it still haunts you to this day… Especially given how it occured with a family member who is supposed to be someone who should be on the look out for you.

I want to commend you on your self-awareness in seeking out support - have you been able to speak to other people you trust and are able to help?

Thanks for being open to share about what you’re currently struggling with. Anger can really be a hard emotion to control and I do relate with what you shared. I think it’s great that you’re aware of the intensity of your emotions when anger arises. It takes strength to reflect after an episode and try to do better, so kudos to you for taking the first step!
From my personal experience, what I find helpful is to be mindful of the physical changes that occur when I start to get agitated e.g. body temperature rising, frowning, clenching of teeth etc. and try to catch myself before things get escalated. At this point, I would try to ask myself some questions to trigger the “thinking” part of my brain : “Would this issue matter to me this time next week?”, “Is there a solution to this issue that I have yet to explore?”, “Could the issue be resolved by asking someone for help?” etc. && of course to take this time to breathe as I’m thinking. Do you know what are some of the physical triggers that you have when you start to feel angry?
Lastly, I just want to end off by saying that it is normal and natural to feel angry. Anger is an emotion that helps us to understand when our boundaries are crossed and allows us to defend ourselves. However, it is also our responsibility to learn how to regulate our responses to anger such that it does not lead to aggression. I hope you give yourself time to learn and be patient with yourself. Should you need support on your journey, we’ll be happy to listen!",,2,,14206,,14206.0,

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us. I want to start by acknowledging the strength it takes to recognise and acknowledge that you’re struggling with anger. It’s not easy to confront our emotions, especially when they feel overwhelming and difficult to manage.
Anger is a natural emotion that we all experience from time to time, and it often serves as an indicator that something is triggering us or causing distress. At the core of it, anger is actually ingrained into our brain to protect us - it causes our heart rate to increase, and a rush of hormones is released to create a surge of energy so that we can take action. However, when anger becomes intense or leads to aggression and violent thoughts, it can be concerning and impact various aspects of our lives, including our mental and physical well-being.
First and foremost, it’s essential to prioritise your safety and well-being. If you ever feel like you’re in immediate danger of harming yourself or others, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. You can also contact emergency services or a crisis hotline (SOS: 1-767) for immediate assistance.
In addition to seeking professional help, there are steps you can take to manage your anger and its associated symptoms. Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing exercises (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg ) and meditation, can help you become more aware of your emotions and regulate your responses. Engaging in regular physical activity of your choice, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, can also be beneficial in releasing pent-up tension and stress.
Importantly, I want to encourage you to identify and address any underlying triggers or stressors that may be contributing to your anger. Try thinking of anger like an iceberg - most of an iceberg is hidden below the surface of the water, and at times, anger functions in a similar manner. When we’re angry, there can be other emotions that are hidden beneath the surface. It may be easier to identify anger in yourself and/or others, but more challenging to see the underlying feelings that the anger may be protecting. Keeping a journal to track your emotions and experiences can help you gain insight into patterns and triggers. Additionally, practising healthy communication skills and setting boundaries in your relationships can help prevent conflicts and reduce feelings of anger and frustration.

Thank you coming on here and being open to share about your struggles with self-harm and depressed mood. I can’t imagine what it’s like for you - it sounds very bleak and tiring - but at the same time, I can see that you’re trying to work on yourself or to try to figure out what you can do. And I hope that coming on here can help to build on your resilience and draw support from the community
I hear how tough things are is getting you to contemplate a situation where you no longer need to confront the distress or anguish… I get that. To feel to that extent means that you’ve been too overwhelmed to cope. I’d like to share that it can be helpful to get assistance from a trusted person anytime it gets too overwhelming for you. Let them know about the thoughts you’re having, how you’re feeling, and that you would want to be safe (e.g., keeping your surroundings safe, put away dangerous items like knifes/medications in locked cabinets, look for you immediately if you’re in distress, etc.). This plan helps them know what they can do exactly during those moments to support you. If you feel like you need to speak to someone immediately, or things are just highly distressing, you can reach out anytime 24/7 to Samaritans of Singapore (1-767), IMH’s 24 hour helpline (6389 2222) and SOS’s 24hour CareText: 9151 1767 (via WhatsApp).
Some of the things you describe about how you feel regarding your body seem to indicate a sort of depersonalisation . This unsettling experience is associated with extreme emotional states, exhaustion, trauma, etc. I’m curious to know whether something occured at the start of term 2? Have you spoken to someone you’re comfortable with about this before? I can’t imagine how isolating this feels for you, so social support can help you through this by having someone to turn to and not feel like you’re alone in this (and that you’re cared for).
I also wonder whether this had happened to you in the past - what would you do to help with the distress? I can see how it will be difficult to engage in those now but what would be things that you enjoy that can help boost your mood? Let’s tap on your strengths to halt or ‘break out’ of what feels like a downward spiral by expressing your emotions in a helpful manner, being kind to yourself, and shifting (to a more helpful) perspective.

The fact that you even bothered coming on here to share shows that you want to help yourself, and I think you should be proud of yourself for that.
I think it would be good for you to identify your triggers: What’s triggering your suicidal thoughts? Is it the pressure from school, or are there other factors weighing in to make you feel upset?
Once you’ve identified the triggers then it’d be easier to work on them. For example, if you’re feeling overwhelmed by your studies, you can try planning a study schedule that is easy to follow where you have sufficient breaks and realistic study session goals.

Thank you for sharing with us your thoughts, I hear you, and it sounds like you’re going through a really tough time. I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to open up about what you’re experiencing. Feeling lonely, even when surrounded by friends, can be very isolating (I know how that feels!). It’s tough when those around us are preoccupied with their own lives and struggles, leaving us feeling like there’s no one to turn to.
I think it’s common to develop bad habits and lose energy and sleep in response to feeling overwhelmed and disconnected. I can also understand that it’s difficult to muster up the motivation to take care of yourself or tackle tasks when you’re feeling this way.
You mentioned feeling confused and uncertain about everything, and it’s completely valid to feel that way when you’re struggling with your mental health. I want you to know that you’re not alone in this, and we are here with you.
One suggestion is to focus on your self-care, even if it feels hard to do so at first. This could mean setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day, such as getting enough sleep, eating nourishing meals, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, even if it’s just for a few minutes at a time
Additionally, please do consider reaching out to a mental health professional to help you process these difficult emotions and develop healthier ways of coping with stress and loneliness. Here are some options you can try:
- Nearby Family Service Centre: MSF | Directories
- Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
- ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
Lastly, please remember that it’s okay to ask for help and support! Your friends may not be aware of what you’re going through, and reaching out to them could open up the opportunity for deeper connections and understanding.
Let us know if you’ve reached out to any mental health professional who can journey with you, and remember we’re here to support you too.

IBS(irritable bowel syndrome) during this burnt out as well and it has been bugging me on and off affecting my sleep and daily life.
In addition, I started facing other health issues and work related issues.
I had a check up and found out that my liver enzymes is kinda elevated so the doc send me for scans and reviews. I was really worried that my conditions are really serious and kept thinking about it which made me kinda anxious I guess.( eventually found out I just had a mild case of fatty liver which is reversible but I do have some small growth in my gallbladder which they would like me to go back for yearly reviews). After the review, I had other symptoms which are very similar to heart disease which made me constantly self aware of any symptoms no matter how small they maybe( went to doc for check up and they said I have anxiety issue). This really made me feel lousy about myself.
As for work related issue, I have been rather successful when it comes to obtaining jobs however recent I have been jobless due to contract ending and unable to get a job of my preference. All these made me feel lousy and maybe depressed as well.

Here is the thing, Most people think progress is like a straight line that goes up in a graph. It doesnt work that way. There will be seasons. You know how trees loose their leaves in autumn and grow back in summer ? Same like us.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with anxiety and worries about being in relationships. I hear how your past experience is shaping how you currently respond to perceived assurances from your partner. I want you to know that what you’re thinking and feeling about the situation is valid given your circumstances.
First off, anxiety serves a purpose - as a response to looming threat so that your body is prepared for fight or flight. That can be useful as it makes you vigilant to cues that something’s not right. However, it stops being useful when you misperceive thoughts or symptoms (panic, worry, anxiety attacks) as relentless threats that need to be stopped. Instead of a healthy amount of anxiety guiding us (for example, studying harder for a difficult paper, working on being a better partner, etc.) it now becomes a distraction and rush to do things to make the discomfort go away (by avoiding things, seeking reassurances from others, worrying even more).
So this is where you can try to differentiate vigilance from overstating possibilities from worrying As much as it feels like the worse is going to happen, try to check-in with yourself: what are realistic chances of it happening/being true as well as the alternative. This helps you to pause and check if you’re thoughts are accurate and/or helpful. This will be difficult to change so you can start by being kind to yourself, know that feelings are not facts, and anchor to your values or things that are important to you -
- What do you look for: List the things you want in your main relationships. Then, ask yourself how you contribute to the things you want. For example, if you want honesty in your relationships, honesty is likely one of your values.
- What are your deal-breakers: List the things you can’t/won’t tolerate in your relationships. Then, ask yourself how you can behave to avoid those deal-breakers. For example, if you don’t want dishonesty that’s another way to recognize that honesty is one of your values.
- How must you change to attract these kinds of people: Although we can’t choose all of our relationships, like parents and relatives, we can play a role in attracting our friends and romantic partners. Imagine the kind of people you want to be around, then identify the values you’d like to exemplify in that company. For example, if you want supportive friends, then being a supportive friend may be one of your values.
And if you do have the attacks (try to ground yourself: identify and describe 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste to help shift your focus away from distress and bring you back to the present) know that its not a setback but an opportunity to explore for deeper thoughts and a chance to work on yourself by building resilience and feeling comfortable with discomfort that is inevitable in relationships. And if you require further support, do seek out professionals from Family Service Centres . Let us know what you think.

Thanks for sharing your personal relationship experience with us here. It must have been a very difficult decision to make, to go through a divorce. I think it takes a lot of strength to leave and to put yourself out there again for love. I hope you know how strong of a person you are and how far you’ve come.
While I’m sure that you’ve taken the time to heal, it is normal to have some of these negative feelings and anxiety surface again when you’re in a new relationship. These are the learnings that you have from your previous relationship and you are now better equipped to protect yourself from the hurt that you experienced before. So I hope that you’re not being too hard on yourself. I think it’s great that you’re aware of your feelings and you are trying to better regulate it.
What I think might be helpful is to be open to your new partner of the struggles that you’ve been having. You don’t have to solve all these issues on your own. Sometimes what can help quieten the negative thoughts are the support and affirmations from your partner, to help you recreate that safe space again.
Personally, I also rely on journaling to pen down my anxious thoughts. That way I also allow space for myself to re-organise and rationalise my thoughts. Alternatively, should you need anyone to talk to when you’re feeling anxious, feel free to reach out. We would love to lend a listening ear!",,1,,14172,,14172.0,

Thanks for being so courageous in sharing your struggles with us. I want to start by acknowledging the pain you’re experiencing after the end of your relationship. Please know that your feelings are completely valid - it’s understandable to feel a range of emotions, including sadness, frustration, and worthlessness, especially given the circumstances you’ve described.
Experiencing depressive thoughts and lashing out at others can be indicators that you’re struggling with your mental health, and it’s important to address these concerns with care and compassion. It’s commendable that you’ve reached out for support, and I want to reassure you that you’re not alone in this.
If you feel comfortable, I would like to ask some follow-up questions to better understand your situation and how I can best support you. Specifically:
- How long have you been experiencing these depressive thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, and how persistent are they?
- Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to exacerbate these feelings?
- Are there any activities or coping strategies that you’ve found helpful in making you feel better?
In the meantime, I have a couple of suggestions that may help you manage:
2. Practice self-compassion: Be gentle with yourself; know that it’s natural to feel the way you do after experiencing a breakup - it’s a reflection of how much the relationship meant to you. Avoid self-criticism and negative self-talk, and instead, try to offer yourself kindness and understanding during this challenging time.
3. Engage in self-care: Prioritise activities that promote your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. This could include exercise, spending time outdoors, engaging in hobbies you enjoy, practicing relaxation techniques, and ensuring you’re getting enough rest and nutrition.
4. Seek social support: Reach out to trusted friends, family members, or mentors who can provide emotional support and companionship. You mentioned that going out with friends brings about superficial happiness - is there perhaps any other friends or family members you feel like you can completely be yourself around? Opening up to someone you trust about what you’re going through can help alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness.
5. Set boundaries: If you find that spending time with certain friends or engaging in certain activities exacerbates your feelings of worthlessness or superficial happiness, consider setting boundaries to protect your mental health. It’s okay to prioritise your well-being and say no to things that don’t serve you positively.
6. Consider trying out mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Incorporate mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, into your daily routine to help reduce stress and promote emotional balance. Here’s a quick mindfulness-based self-compassion exercise you could try: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg.

I (21m) have been feeling a little down as of late. I have gone through the motions of public schooling and NS, and I am now waiting for uni to start. I don’t really have many close friends, even though I actively make an effort to socialise. I get that friends will often come and go, and that’s perfectly normal, and I have been learning to live with myself, but the overwhelming feeling of loneliness often eats me up inside. The fact that I’m gay (and closeted) only exacerbates my situation. I don’t really have anyone to open up to or confide in, as my parents are the type to sweep our problems under the rug, or simply to maintain a indifferent stance whenever I approach them for advice, so as to placate me.
I have also been feeling lost and purposeless in life, but I know it can be chalked up to the struggles of navigating adulthood. I just wish I has some kind of guidance or some reassurance from someone. Apart from my part-time office job, I spend my days at home, doom scrolling, or not really doing anything productive. I am not a part of any community, nor do I feel a sense of belonging to any community. I am very aware of my destructive habits, but I don’t know how to stop it, and I often times feel guilty and miserable. I want fulfilment in my life, but I feel like I am a spectator of my life, paassively watching from a distance. I feel like my future is bleak, and I haven’t even thought about the fallout of coming out to my family. I have been harbouring a lot of self-resentment, but I genuinely want to get into a better state of mind. I have been trying to practise gratitude and breaking down limiting beliefs, but these coping mechanisms only help me to a certain point.
Any advice or help is greatly appreciated, and thank you if you have read this far.",,2,,,,,

Welcome to our let’s talk community! First and foremost, I want to commend you for reaching out and sharing what you’re going through. It takes courage to open up about our struggles, especially when we’re feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about the future. Please know that you’re not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this challenging time.
It sounds like you’re facing a lot of challenges, including feelings of loneliness, purposelessness, guilt, and self-resentment. It’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed by these emotions, especially given the uncertainty about your future and the added stress of navigating your identity in a society that may not always be accepting.
Feeling stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts and behaviours is a common experience, and it can be incredibly difficult to break free from it on your own. This is where behavioural activation can be particularly helpful. Behavioural activation is a therapeutic approach that focuses on identifying and changing negative patterns of behavior that contribute to feelings of depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges.
One of the key principles of behavioural activation is to gradually increase engagement in activities that bring you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of accomplishment, even when you don’t feel like doing them. By actively participating in positive activities, you can disrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and behaviors and start to experience more positive emotions and a greater sense of purpose in your life.
Here’s how to start:
2. Identify Values and Goals: Start by identifying your values and goals. What is important to you? What do you want to achieve in your life? This could include personal, academic, career, or social goals. Clarifying your values and goals can provide you with a sense of direction and motivation. Here (https://www.actmindfully.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Values_Checklist_-_Russ_Harris.pdf ) is a list of values you could refer to while doing so.
3. List Positive Activities: Make a list of activities that you enjoy or used to enjoy in the past, even if you don’t feel motivated to do them right now. These could be simple activities like going for a walk, listening to music, cooking a favorite meal, or watching an episode of your favourite comfort series on Netflix. Try to include a variety of activities that engage your mind, body, and spirit.
4. Start Small: Begin by choosing one or two activities from your list that you feel capable of doing, even if it’s just for a short amount of time. Start small and gradually increase the duration or intensity of the activities as you feel more comfortable and confident.
5. Schedule Activities: Schedule specific times in your day or week to engage in these activities. Treat them like appointments or commitments that you can’t cancel or postpone. Having a structured routine can help provide a sense of purpose and stability, especially during times when you’re feeling overwhelmed or unmotivated. If you’d like, you can share with us what you plan to do and when too, hopefully that gives you more motivation and helps keep you accountable!
6. Notice Patterns: Pay attention to how you feel before, during, and after engaging in these activities. Notice any changes in your mood, energy level, or outlook on life. Keep track of any patterns or trends that emerge over time.
7. Challenge Negative Thoughts: Practice challenging and reframing negative thoughts that may arise during or after engaging in activities. For example, if you catch yourself thinking, “I’m not good enough,” challenge this thought by asking yourself, “What evidence do I have to support this belief? Is there a more balanced or realistic way to view the situation?”. Here’s an interactive exercise to help you with this: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
To address what you mentioned about not feeling a sense of belonging to any community, I wonder if you’ve considered reaching out to LGBTQ+ support organisations or community groups where you can connect with others who may share similar experiences and provide a supportive and understanding environment? These groups can offer a sense of belonging and connection, as well as resources and information to help you navigate your journey.
Lastly, practising gratitude and challenging limiting beliefs are important coping strategies, and I’m really heartened to hear that you’ve been making an effort to incorporate them into your life. However, it’s also important to recognise that these strategies may have their limitations, and it’s okay to seek additional support when needed. If you find that these coping mechanisms only help you to a certain point or if you’re feeling overwhelmed by your emotions, it may be helpful to consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support.
Perhaps you could first give behavioural activation a try and let us know how that goes for you? Do grant yourself patience and compassion in the process, and remember to celebrate your progress along the way! You deserve to live a fulfilling and meaningful life, and we’re all rooting for you.",https://www.actmindfully.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Values_Checklist_-_Russ_Harris.pdf 1 https://www.actmindfully.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Values_Checklist_-_Russ_Harris.pdf; Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg 1 https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=find_perspective,2,,14084,,14084.0,

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us. I hear you - there’s a lot of pressure to make decisions regarding our future relatively early on in our society, and that can be really stressful and daunting. I want to commend you for reaching out and expressing your concerns about the anxiety you’re experiencing regarding making important life choices after graduating from secondary school. It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings, and I want you to know that you’re most definitely not alone in this struggle.
Feeling anxious and overwhelmed when faced with significant decisions about your future is a common experience, and it’s completely understandable to feel unsure or hesitant about which path to take. Making decisions that will impact your life can be an intimidating process, especially when you’re not entirely sure about your passions or interests.
@Marshmallow.youghurt has mentioned one possible option you could explore - perhaps you may wish to consider seeking guidance from a career counselor or educational advisor who can provide personalised assistance in exploring your interests, strengths, and potential career paths. Many schools and educational institutions offer career guidance services, and there are also government-funded initiatives such as SkillsFuture that provide career and education planning support.
Additionally, if you find that your anxiety is significantly impacting your daily functioning or well-being, it may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional such as a counselor or therapist. They can work with you to develop coping strategies, explore the underlying factors contributing to your anxiety, and provide support as you navigate through this transitional period in your life.
In the meantime, here are some practical steps you can take to help manage your anxiety and approach decision-making with greater confidence:
- Break tasks into smaller, more manageable steps: Rather than focusing on the overwhelming nature of the decision-making process as a whole, break it down into smaller, actionable steps. This can help make the process feel more manageable and less daunting.
- Explore your interests and values: You could take this as an opportunity to get to know yourself better. Try to set aside some time to reflect on your interests, values, and goals. What activities or subjects do you enjoy? What are your strengths and skills? Understanding yourself better can help guide you towards decisions that align with your passions and aspirations. If this is too challenging to do on your own, you could also explore having this conversation with your ECG Counselor.
- Challenge negative thoughts: Notice any self-doubt or negative thoughts that arise during the decision-making process, and challenge them with more balanced and realistic perspectives. Remind yourself that it’s normal to feel uncertain at times, and that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. Here’s an interactive exercise that may help you with this: https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=find_perspective
I just want to end off by reassuring you that it’s okay to take your time and explore different options before making a decision. You don’t have to have all the answers right away - we’re all, in some way or another, still trying to figure things out as we go! Please be patient and compassionate with yourself as you navigate through this process. You have the strength and resilience to overcome your anxiety and make choices that are right for you. Take one step at a time, and know that support is available here whenever you need it! We’re all cheering for you!

Not sure about others but it feels rather taboo for me… Hence I want to really understand a little bit more incase I really do want to seek professional help in the future for me or family/friends.
I come from a lower income family so costs and accessibility are my main concerns. To preface: I really appreciate you for being in the line of work but I apologize if any of the questions are too straight forward or naive.
2. Are the rates subjected to govt subsidies especially if you are from a lower income household? What routes/pathways are there for affordable sessions with a therapist
3. To what extend is best recommended for someone to see a therapist. A analogy can be drawn to physical health checkups: You can do annual health checkups even with/out symptoms. Where should one draw the line and say “it’s time to see a professional for my mental health”

I will leave the 1st question to the professionals/ peer supporters/ others to answer as I am not very sure of all the various pathways though I know referral at Polyclinics are subsidized and there might be some organizations that provides subsidized therapy.
Regarding your 2nd question, personally my belief is that you shouldn’t wait for something to happen before you seek help. Like how there’s physical check ups, there should also be mental health check ups.
And then regarding your 3rd question, I don’t really have an answer per se, from my general sensing and personal experience I would say that you are able to talk about anything that you’d liked and your therapist should be trained enough to help guide the conversation and if it’s beyond their expertise then they would most likely refer you to the appropriate channels (help).",,2,,14002,,14002.0,

Thank you for your questions! I want to start by acknowledging the courage it took for you to reach out and ask these questions about seeking professional help for mental health concerns. It’s completely understandable that you may feel some hesitation or uncertainty, especially given the perceived taboo surrounding therapy in our society. However, it’s important to recognise that seeking support for your mental health is a courageous and proactive step towards self-care and well-being.
To address your first question, there are options available to make therapy more accessible and affordable, particularly for individuals from lower-income households. Many therapists and counseling centers offer sliding-scale fees, which means they adjust their rates based on your income level to ensure that therapy remains affordable for you. Here are a couple of options:
2. Some Family Service Centers (FSCs) provide counseling support at nominal fees. You can check out your nearest FSC here: SupportGoWhere .
3. As @Marshmallow.youghurt rightfully pointed out as well, you could consider going through the Polyclinic route to get a referral for subsidised care in hospitals. There are also in-house mental health services in certain Polyclinics for various mental health conditions. You will first have to see a family physician at the polyclinic and then be referred into the psychological services as assessed.
4. This article (Affordable Therapy in Singapore: Cheap & Free Counselling Sessions - readlatable ) has a list of other community services and organisations that provide affordable mental health support. It’s worth exploring these options to see if you qualify for financial assistance or subsidies.
As for determining when it’s the right time to see a therapist, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Just like with physical health checkups, it’s important to prioritise your mental health and seek support when you’re experiencing distress or struggling to cope with life’s challenges. You don’t need to wait until you reach a crisis point to seek help; therapy can be beneficial for a wide range of concerns, from managing stress and anxiety to navigating relationships and coping with life transitions.
In terms of the range of discussions that can be had with a therapist, it’s truly vast and covers everything from everyday stressors and relationship issues to more complex mental health conditions. A therapist provides a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and they can offer guidance, support, and strategies to help you navigate through difficult emotions and situations. You have the freedom to discuss whatever is on your mind, and your therapist will work with you to address your individual needs and goals.
If you’re still feeling uncertain or have more questions about therapy, I encourage you to reach out to mental health professionals or counseling centers in your area for more information. They can provide you with guidance, support, and resources to help you make informed decisions about your mental health care. Alternatively, please feel free to share your questions with us!

Thank you for sharing your frustrations with us, I hear you and it sounds like you’re feeling very frustrated and disillusioned with the people around you, and that’s completely understandable. Feeling unheard or dismissed can be very isolating and hurtful, especially when you’re reaching out for support or understanding.
It’s natural to crave genuine connection and validation from others, especially during difficult times. When those expectations aren’t met, it can amplify our feelings of anger and resentment and hence I feel that it’s important to recognize that everyone responds to distress differently, and sometimes people may not know how to respond appropriately, even if they care about you deeply.
I hope that you will try to find healthy ways to express and cope with your emotions because this can be empowering. Whether it’s through journaling, creative outlets, or physical activity or any hobbies, finding ways to channel your frustrations constructively can help you regain a sense of control and clarity.
I also want to encourage you to speak to a professional counsellor about your frustration, as they can help you to process the underlying thoughts and feelings that you have and learn coping strategies to help you manage them.
Remember, your feelings are valid, and you are important. Please let us know how you’re coping and if you’ve managed to reach out to anyone for emotional support? Hear from you soon.",,1,,13925,,13925.0,

Speaking from personal experience, I think it’s completely ok to not know who you want to be or what your authentic self looks like because our perception of ourselves, the people around us, our environment, our likes and dislikes are always changing and evolving.
Probably some prompts to help you figure things out is
2. What are your current values in life
3. What would you say are your personal strengths and weaknesses
4. What motivates and matters to you
5. What are your likes and dislikes
Additionally, it can be helpful to see a professional to help provide guidance in discovering yourself.

This is me too, I find it hard to stick to a schedule/ timetable but personally I feel what helps is to list down all the things or keep in mind what I need to get done in the day/ week, rather than sticking to a time that I have to do this, I’d just keep in mind that I need to do this by then.
I don’t know if I make sense but an example is if I know that I’ve a test in a weeks time, rather than saying that I need to study everyday at this time for a x number of time, I’ll tell and remind myself that I’ve a test and I’ll allocate certain time (not fixed everyday) to study.
I think the main gist is to go slow/ gentle, it’s hard for someone to pivot from going with the flow to someone who follows a schedule down to the tee.", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/advice-for-better-managing-my-time/9153/1,3,,13843,,,13843

Thanks for sharing with us your struggles, I can imagine how challenging it must feel to go through this transition from a more relaxed approach to a more structured one. It sounds like you’re really grappling with finding the balance between flexibility and organization, especially when faced with a multitude of tasks! It’s completely normal to feel stressed and overwhelmed when trying to implement new habits, especially ones that require such a shift in mindset - honestly I would feel the same too if I were you!
Firstly, it might be helpful to start small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire schedule at once, maybe you could try incorporating just one or two structured elements into your day at a time? This could be something as simple as setting specific times for meals or designating blocks of time for focused work.
Secondly, you can consider using visual aids or tools to help you stay organized! You could try using a physical planner or calendar, or explore digital apps and software designed for time management. Experiment with different methods until you find one that resonates with you and feels manageable. I find it helpful to use a habit tracker or a time management tool from the app store (anyone will do!)
Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day, and forming new habits takes time and patience Be gentle with yourself as you work through this process, and celebrate the small victories along the way!

It’s really really fking hard to be in that school. Because that the school has the Satelite school program, which is a program to integrate with mainstream schools that are neuraltypical, the people there can be mean and have been mean to me. Like today, I was talking with some of my friends from that school (some of them are nice and i have no friends in my class OR in pathlight due to the fact i dont associate or vibe with them as much) and a group came over and suddenly said that the people diagonal to me want to talk to me. They wanted me to go over to them. Thing is that i never talked to them before. And felt they were pushing me away. It really wasnt something i wanted to experience. And i hate the experience as a whole.
Being in pathlight is very hard because i have no friends in class or in the school. Although i have friends who are mildly autistic and dont have much problems, i wont consider them like a friend compared to my other friends outside school. My friends outside school are from international schools and i rlly love them a lot. I had to leave the international school to pathlight due to uncertain future and circumstances.
All in all, I really dont want to be in pathlight anymore. I endured this school for 3 years 2 months and 26 ■■■■■■■ days. I just dont belong here. And the story about what happened today was that it was really mean of them for what they did. And when i stayed at the table, they said they had ‘class’ and walked away. Which i knew they were avoiding me as i could tell from their faces.

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us. I’m truly sorry to hear about the difficult experience you’ve been facing in school. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and you’re struggling to find genuine connections and friendships within the school environment. Feeling like you don’t belong or that you’re being treated unfairly can be incredibly challenging, especially when you’re already navigating the complexities of school life. I hear that you’re feeling isolated and misunderstood, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling frustrated and hurt by the actions of others.
You’re absolutely right - being in a special education school doesn’t define who you are as a person. You are unique and deserving of respect and understanding, regardless of the school you attend or any labels that may be placed upon you. It’s unfair for anyone to make assumptions or treat you differently simply because of the educational setting you’re in.
It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s okay to seek support from trusted individuals who can understand and empathise with your experiences. Whether it’s reaching out to a teacher, counselor, or trusted adult within the school, or seeking support from friends and family outside of school, having someone to talk to and lean on during difficult times can make a significant difference.
Additionally, it might be helpful to explore ways to cultivate connections and interests outside of school that bring you joy and fulfillment. Whether it’s spending time with your friends from your previous school, pursuing hobbies or activities that you love, or seeking out communities where you feel understood and accepted, finding sources of support and belonging beyond the school environment can be empowering.
Please know that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to advocate for yourself and your well-being. You deserve to feel valued and respected, and I encourage you to continue speaking up about your experiences and seeking support from those who can provide understanding and empathy. Our community is also here to support you and will wait to hear more from you. Take care and I wish you well",,1,,,,,

Thanks for sharing your concerns with us. It’s understandable to have concerns about these kinds of thoughts, and I appreciate you reaching out for clarification and support. It’s not uncommon for people to experience intrusive or distressing thoughts from time to time, especially when engaging in activities that involve potential risks, such as cooking or using appliances like pressure cookers.
What you’re describing sounds like a phenomenon known as intrusive thoughts, which are unwanted or distressing thoughts that pop into your mind unexpectedly. While these thoughts can be unsettling, it’s important to know that experiencing them doesn’t mean you’re going to act on them. In fact, many people experience intrusive thoughts without ever acting on them. You can read more on identifying and managing intrusive thoughts here: Managing intrusive thoughts - Harvard Health . Some questions I encourage you to ask yourself are:
- How long have you been experiencing these thoughts? Have they become more frequent or intense over time?
- How do these thoughts typically make you feel? Do they cause you significant distress or anxiety?
- Are there specific situations or triggers that seem to make these thoughts more likely to occur?
There are various reasons why someone might experience intrusive thoughts. They can be linked to anxiety, stress, or even just a natural response to being aware of potential dangers in your environment. Our minds often try to protect us by alerting us to possible risks, but sometimes these thoughts can become more frequent or intense, especially if we’re already feeling anxious or stressed.
While occasional intrusive thoughts are normal, if they’re causing you significant distress or interfering with your daily life, I would encourage you to explore strategies to manage them by reaching out to a mental health professional (https://www.mindset.com.sg/sites/mindset/files/mindset/understanding-mental-health/NCSS-Directory-on-Mental-Health-Services.pdf). They can help you better understand the underlying factors contributing to your intrusive thoughts and work with you to develop coping mechanisms to manage them more effectively. There are various techniques such as mindfulness, grounding exercises, and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), which can be effective in helping to reduce the frequency and intensity of intrusive thoughts and alleviate associated anxiety.
Lastly, I want you to know that you’re not alone, and there are resources and support available to help you navigate through this. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Your well-being is important, and we’re here to support you in any way we can.","Managing intrusive thoughts - Harvard Health 1 https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/managing-intrusive-thoughts#:~:text=If%20a%20thought%20is%20disturbing,%2C%22%20says%20Dr.%20Williams; https://www.mindset.com.sg/sites/mindset/files/mindset/understanding-mental-health/NCSS-Directory-on-Mental-Health-Services.pdf https://www.mindset.com.sg/sites/mindset/files/mindset/understanding-mental-health/NCSS-Directory-on-Mental-Health-Services.pdf",2,,,,,

To introduce myself, I’m 20 and I have been careful about money ever since I was young due to my family circumstances. It wasn’t until recently where my BMT mates introduced to me about investing. Of course, I didn’t get right into it but it took about a month where I was curious about investing, especially cryptocurrency.
To start with my journey in crypto, I invested about $100 at the start and did see some gains rather quickly. Feeling the FOMO, I invested a whooping $15.6k (90% of my savings) right off the bat. Somehow, I gained so much money within 2 weeks, it was a close to a $3k gain and I was surprised with the rate I’m earning. I was super clouded with the money I’m gaining and I got myself into a pump & dump project, Ponzi Scheme, bunch of questionable things. In the end, I have lost a total of $3k off my initial investment.
I had sleepless nights for days, unable to focus during training, walking mindlessly to the point I almost fell down to a drain. I can’t stop shaking my hands even now. All because of me cannot stop thinking about the $3k I had lost. I know I have to blame myself for the mistake, but I couldn’t because my mind kept blaming the crypto system. It took me a whole week to consolidate myself and really understand the dangers of crypto and investments as a whole.
Last time I always laughed at people who got scammed, thinking it wouldn’t happen to me. Karma exists, and its my turn to receive it. Thanks for reading this story of mine, and I hope this doesn’t deter anyone from investing, but rather be more cautious doing so. I paid $3k to learn it the hard way, and it still hurts me mentally although feeling better slowly.",,4,,,,,

I can understand that you feel shaken by this experience, especially since it came from a place of curiosity and a desire to explore something new. It’s commendable that you’re reflecting on this experience and recognizing the need to be more cautious in the future Learning from our mistakes is an important part of personal growth, even though it can be a painful process We all experience this in our lives.
As you continue to heal and regain your sense of balance, try to be gentle and compassionate with yourself. It’s okay to feel upset and disappointed, but it’s also important to forgive yourself and focus on the lessons learned. Perhaps this experience can serve as a reminder to trust your instincts, do thorough research before making financial decisions, and seek guidance from trusted sources

I have my own scam story to share too. When I was in primary school, I was heavily invested in this game called Runescape. I was googling for ways to earn more coins and I came across this website that promised unlimited gold but they’ll need my username and password to deposit the gold into my account. Stupid 11-year old me believed that and put in my username and password. Within minutes, my account was wiped out.
Considering the amount of time I invested in that game, I think it was an expensive lesson haha but now that I think back of it, it does help me become more aware of scams. I hope this lesson helps you learn too! We’ll all do better after each lesson.",,1,,,,,

I can imagine how concerning this situation must be for you. Experiencing irregularities in your menstrual cycle and not knowing its underlying cause can be distressing, especially at your age. It’s commendable that you’ve taken the proactive first step to consult a doctor at the clinic and are awaiting further evaluation at the hospital.
Firstly, I want to reassure you that you’re not alone in experiencing irregular periods, and it’s important to seek medical advice when you notice significant changes or concerns - so I’m really glad that you’ve taken that step and reached out for support. Your healthcare provider will be able to conduct a thorough evaluation, which may include medical history, physical examination, and possibly some tests to determine the cause of your irregular periods. I highly encourage you to openly discuss any questions or concerns you may have with your healthcare provider at your appointment as well.
I hear you - waiting for your hospital appointment can be anxiety-provoking and challenging. It’s normal to feel worried about your health and what the outcome of the evaluation may be. During this time, try to manage any worries or anxieties you may be experiencing by practicing self-care techniques such as deep breathing exercises (https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=breathe_deeply), engaging in activities you enjoy, and seeking support from trusted friends or family members. If you’ve noticed anxiety-provoking thoughts come up frequently, I encourage you to try this thought reframing exercise to shift your perspective (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg ).
Remember that every person’s body is different, and there can be various factors that contribute to irregular periods, including hormonal changes, stress, diet, and lifestyle factors. Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop a plan that addresses your specific needs and concerns.
Please know that it’s normal to feel anxious or worried about your health, but you’re taking the right steps by seeking medical advice and advocating for your well-being. If you have any additional questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider or our community for support.

Thanks for sharing with us your struggles and frustrations, I hear you, and I want you to know that what you’re experiencing is valid and you’re not alone. It sounds like you’re going through a very challenging time right now, both professionally and personally.
Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and exhausted is a heavy burden to carry, especially when it feels like everything is piling up around you. It’s completely understandable that you’re struggling to manage your workload, emotions, and external pressures. It’s a lot for anyone to handle, and it’s okay to feel the way you do.
First and foremost, I want to emphasize the importance of seeking support. You don’t have to go through this alone. I highly recommend you talking to a therapist or counsellor as they can provide you with a safe space to unpack your emotions, explore coping strategies, and develop a plan to address your challenges. They can also help you process your feelings of self-doubt and anxiety about how others perceive you.

Thank you for sharing your struggles, I hear you, and it sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pain and confusion in your relationship right now. I can completely understand that you feel hurt and neglected when you’re not feeling included or valued by your partner’s friends. It must be difficult to feel like you’re not a priority in your partner’s life, especially after being together for over three years.
It’s concerning that your partner seems hesitant to introduce you to her best friends and is afraid to share information about your relationship with them. It’s natural to want to feel integrated into each other’s social circles, and it’s important for your partner to communicate openly and honestly with you about her concerns.
Here are a couple of suggestions that might help you process this situation:
2. Have An Open Communication with her. You can encourage your partner to have an open and honest conversation with you about her relationship with her best friends and why she feels hesitant to introduce you to them. Let her know that you’re there to support her and that you want to understand her perspective better.
3. Try Couples Counseling: I encourage you to consider seeking the support of a couples therapist who can help facilitate communication and address any underlying issues in your relationship. A therapist can provide a safe space for both of you to express your feelings and work through these challenges together. I’ve listed this resource so that you can seek support from a mental health professional: Couples Counselling Resource from Singapore Association for Counselling
I hope these suggestions are helpful for you. In the meantime, please keep us updated on how your conversation with your partner went and if you’ve managed to reach out to any mental health professional for your couple-counselling.

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles, I’m so sorry to hear about the challenges you’ve faced throughout your school years and the impact it’s had on your mental well-being. I hear you, it’s really tough to understand and work through social situations, especially when past experiences have left you feeling isolated and anxious.
Firstly, I want to commend you for reaching out for help and support. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your struggles and seek help. You are a brave one!
It’s understandable that you might feel hesitant about talking to the school counselor, but please know that their role is to provide a safe and supportive space for students to express their concerns and receive guidance. They are trained professionals who are there to help without judgment, and everything you share with them is kept confidential. I highly encourage you to speak to your school counsellor soon.

In addition to seeking support from a counselor, please do consider exploring other resources or avenues for help. This could include support groups for individuals with social anxiety or communication difficulties, online forums where you can connect with others who share similar experiences, or self-help books and resources that offer strategies for improving social skills and building self-confidence.
Remember that progress takes time, and it’s okay to take small steps toward your goals. You don’t have to tackle everything at once, and it’s okay to ask for help along the way.

I’ve also become physically anxious to any loud noises made by the people at home even though they’ve never been violent. I hate this feeling of heart racing, overthinking whether I made anyone mad.
I feel really lonely & I have this habit of constantly doom scrolling social media to distract myself, even though I know I’ll end up feeling worse after that.
My biggest problem is that I cannot stop thinking negatively about everything. I’m always on guard over something, I’m always worried about what people think and it really sucks.

Thanks for sharing with us how you feel, I hear you and I’m truly sorry to hear about the difficult experiences you’ve had growing up in an emotionally abusive and absent family setting. It’s completely understandable that you would feel like a lost child without a safe source of communication and support at home. The impact of such upbringing can be so deep and far-reaching, often affecting how we form relationships and cope with stress later in life.
Living in an environment where loud noises trigger physical anxiety is a clear indication of the lasting effects of your past experiences, even if they were not explicitly violent. Your feelings of loneliness and the habit of doom scrolling on social media to distract yourself are common coping mechanisms for dealing with emotional pain, but as you mentioned, they often end up exacerbating the negative feelings.
I just want to say that it’s really so brave of you to acknowledge your struggles with negative thinking and constant worry about others’ perceptions. These patterns of thought are understandable responses to the environment you grew up in, but they can also be addressed and changed with time and support
I would like to encourage you to take a step to reach out for emotional support through therapy. Seeking therapy with a qualified mental health professional can provide a safe space for you to explore and process your emotions, understand the root causes of your negative thinking patterns, and learn healthy coping strategies to manage anxiety and improve self-esteem.
Here are some options that for mental health support that you can try:
- Nearby Family Service Centre: MSF | Directories

Thanks for coming on here and sharing about your relationship and thoughts of ending the relationship. It’s probably stressing you out as you head towards it. I hear that the attraction has kinda transformed more into a burden as you look to prioritise your wellbeing. Have you felt this way during the relationship? Or did something recently happen? I wonder if any of your shared interests with one another changed (to kinda answer your question on why is this suddenly happening?).
Next, I’m curious on the relationship you expect/hope to have with the other party after the current one ends? Do you still want to stay in touch closely, hi/bye kinda friend, or returning to the friendship that you 2 used to have? The closeness and proximity of the subsequent relationship will probably guide you on what to say. Choose a suitable time and place where there’s minimal distractions to have an open and honest conversation, which means being in an open posture and listening attentively for both parties to feel heard, instead of thinking what to say next. Let each other have the opportunity to speak but ensure that it’s respectful (so that the other party can mirror a similar behaviour/stance as you). And as you express your thoughts and feelings in a helpful manner, remember to take deep breaths when you have the need to calm yourself.
Most importantly is to carry out actions that are guided by your values (things that are important to you or matter a lot for you) and to ensure you get what you really want hence being prepared (I guess planning for the worst but hoping for the best) when you both meet to talk. I hope things go well and do let us know what you think! Until then, take care!",values https://www.melbournewellbeinggroup.com.au/the-wellbeing-blog/values-as-a-compass,2,,,,,

Thanks for sharing your worries, I hear you, and it sounds like you’re experiencing a whirlwind of emotions right now. Long-distance connections can be both exciting and challenging at the same time. I can understand that you feel upset when you miss someone you care about deeply, especially when you’re separated by distance. The longing and the desire to reach out are signs of how much this person means to you. It’s okay to want to connect and express your feelings, but it’s also understandable to worry about bothering them.
Perhaps you could share with them how you’re feeling and your concerns about potentially bothering them? This could help them have a deeper understanding about your concerns.
Another thing you can try is to establish a routine for communication, which might help ease some of the uncertainty. For example, setting specific times to connect, whether it’s through texts, calls, or video chats, can give you both something to look forward to and alleviate some of the anxiety about reaching out at the wrong time
Last but not least, it’s important to take care of yourself too! Try to engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, even when you’re missing the person. And know that it’s okay to reach out for support from friends or loved ones anytime!

Thank you for asking this question about whether it’s normal for you to throw away your social life. It sounds like you’ve been feeling distressed and overwhelmed with your present social situation, and all of these feelings have culminated in the desire to become avoidant altogether. I can imagine that it would be frustrating for you to be feeling this way about the things that you enjoy and love - things that should be bringing you joy but have now seem to become a source of irritation for you instead.
I’d like to invite you to first ask yourself these questions:
2. What kind of situations have you been facing, which is making you want to avoid people who enter your life? You mentioned that these thoughts started at the start of this year – was there a particular social encounter or experience that had brought about these thoughts and emotions?
3. What do you see yourself enjoying, besides socialising with people? Are there perhaps things you could do that recharges you while not requiring much social interaction with others?
Asking yourself these questions could help you to reflect on the reasons underlying these emotions that you are experiencing surrounding social interactions with others. I can imagine that it can be challenging and perhaps even exhausting to maintain social interactions when you don’t have sufficient opportunities or time to recharge. This may particularly be the case if you are someone that requires quite a bit of me-time or alone time to re-energise yourself. Sometimes, when we’re not taking care of ourselves, we can become cranky and very easily triggered by every little thing. There’s simply no way for us to pour out of an empty cup. If this is something you’re able to resonate with in your present situation, then I would like to encourage you to practice self-care by trying to schedule more pockets of time for yourself in between other commitments that you may have. This self-care assessment worksheet (1) might allow you to get a rough sensing of whether a lack of self-care could have been contributing to the emotions that you’ve been feeling and give you some inspiration on some self-care activities that you could incorporate into your daily life.
(1) Self Care Assessment Worksheet
The second thing you could do is to try to identify your triggers. For example - are there specific types of interactions that have been making you breakdown in tears, or specific relationships in your life that are particularly difficult? Are there any common patterns that you’ve noticed in the interactions that you’ve found draining or difficult? If you are able to identify what had triggered you in these situations and get a better sense of the circumstances surrounding these triggers, you could then work on managing yourself better when similar situations arise in the future. As much as social interactions can be draining, realistically speaking we know that we won’t be able to avoid such interactions completely in the future. Something we could try to do instead is to work on managing ourselves in such situations. For example, we could start by taking note of the thoughts in your mind in these situations. You could then evaluate these thoughts by asking questions such as, “Is there substantial evidence for my thought?” and “Is there evidence contrary to my thought?”. You may refer to this worksheet (2) for a detailed template to do this.
The third thing that I’d like to share with you is the idea of negative self-talk, and the concept of self-compassion. I’m hearing that everything you love now feels like a burden and a source of irritation to you, and I’m wondering if there are perhaps any negative self-talk or self-beliefs that are contributing to such feelings? Negative self-talk refers to the negative thoughts and beliefs that we have about ourselves that can be self-critical, judgmental, and unhelpful. They are also often automatic and may happen without us even realising it. Negative self-talk can contribute significantly to feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. It can make us feel like we are not good enough, that we are flawed or defective in some way, and can even lead us to avoid certain situations or people. If you feel like this is something you can relate to, then I’d like to also share the notion of self-compassion with you.
Self-compassion is the idea of accepting yourself for who you are and coming to terms with the fact that you are a work in progress, with strengths and weaknesses. You could start by taking a step back and think about the way that you speak to yourself. You may refer to this post (3) for more resources and exercises to help you be more gentle with yourself. We also have a mindfulness-based directed self-compassion exercise here that you could try (4).
To end off, I’d like to affirm your courage in coming forward to share your struggles and your efforts in trying to cope with these feelings that you’re faced with. I hope that some of these questions and suggestions will be able to guide you along as you navigate these emotions. If you find yourself struggling to process these feelings and thoughts on your own, or the frequency of breakdowns increases, I would advise you to approach your school counsellor or a mental health Professional to speak about this at greater length. Remember that you can also respond to this post if you have any follow-up questions. Please take care of yourself in the meantime.

Thanks for coming on here and sharing about your struggles. We’re definitely here for you - to listen and see what we can do to help you through this rough period. First off, I’m terribly sorry to hear what you’ve been put through by someone you considered a friend. This person’s actions did not match up with what he said to you - leading you to feel so hurt.
I can see how important friendships are to you, and to trust another person and to open up to is definitely not easy, especially for you. Now, this could be a time to take stock in terms of what do you look for in a friend. Perhaps checking in with you values can point you towards the kind of person you are and who you want to be surrounded by. Consider the things you value in a friendship and list them down - this helps you to figure out:
- What do you look for: List the things you want in your friendships. Then, ask yourself how you contribute to the things you want. For example, if you want honesty in your friends, honesty is likely one of your values.
- What are your deal-breakers: List the things you can’t/won’t tolerate in your friendships. Then, ask yourself how you can behave to avoid those deal-breakers. For example, if you don’t want dishonesty that’s another way to recognize that honesty is one of your values.
- How must you change to attract these kinds of people: Although we can’t choose all of our relationships, like parents and relatives, we can play a role in attracting our friends and potential partners. Imagine the kind of people you want to be around, then identify the values you’d like to exemplify in that company. For example, if you want supportive friends, then being a supportive friend may be one of your values.
The thing about self esteem or self worth is that it can be built and strengthened so that it can withstand just a bit better in case this happens again. Don’t let setbacks define you - you’re a different person than the one you were before as you now have the insight of looking out for these red flags! Instead, encourage yourself (engage in positive self-talk), be kind to yourself, and shift (to a more helpful) perspective.
Hoping to hear back from you. Let us know what you think.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about what you’re going through. Sounds like you’re struggling with meeting expectations at work given this is your first job. First off, I want to commend you on securing a job and it makes sense for you to be worried given the circumstances - what you’re thinking and feeling is valid.
Have you found yourself worried to this extent before? How would you cope in situations like this? I wonder if your thoughts about not living up to (real or perceived) expectations occur in other areas of your life too? This could warrant some exploration into certain needs that are not met or had been taken from you.
Now, let’s explore a bit more with meeting expectations at work - are the standards sensible and fair for a person new into the role? Perhaps being able to express your concerns with your boss during a time with minimal likelihood of interruptions could be helpful. I wonder if it could be helpful if you have ideas or suggestions on what (like removing barriers or increasing support towards you) can help you carry out work in a manner that is productive, and not at the expense of wellbeing. This negotiation could lead to an outcome that is win-win for all parties involved. For everyone to feel comfortable with the outcome, it would require some brainstorming to invent options/alternatives for mutual gain that doesn’t disadvantage anyone. Of course, this is probably not a one-off discussion so tap on your coping abilities to try to tolerate the distress.
And, to help with the distress, try to notice when you’re starting to feel tense and try to take deep breaths (consider this practice) to calm yourself. This could also give you a pause and help you to regain clarity to figure out what you can do at that moment. Let us know what you think about this? Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need.

I have supportive parents and a few friends. My parents said that if I get fired then so be it because I’ve already told them my problems. I am just worried about finding a job again this year due to the bad economy…

That’s quite worrying because your performance seems to be very subjective and dependent on your boss’s preferences. Do your other colleagues feel the same way? Maybe can get some advice from them too on how to deal with this situation.

9132,eating problems,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/eating-problems/9132,Is This Normal?,---,5858,BKT,Professional,Professional,13789,2,"Hello @anonymous07,
Thank you coming on and seeking support for your friend. Whether your friend is experiencing a disorder requires an assessment that looks into history and what the symptoms are, typically done by mental health professionals. Has your friend spoken to a doctor about this? Typically, there are treatments available for eating disorders and it helps your friend then to be supported by people who understand the diagnosis, should there be one. Perhaps your friend can consider getting a referral from polyclinic, or seek assistance from:
- Family Service Centres
- James Cook University Clinic
- NIE Wellness Centre
- NUS Clinical & Health Psychology Centre
I wonder when did this start for your friend? Did something happen prior to that? Your friend also mentioned about “filling the void…isn’t a void to be filled” - what does your friend mean by this? Regardless whether he does not want to go back or wonder if he is spoiled, keeping on eating even when not hungry is not sustainable so it is helpful for your friend to seek support. However, it is probably not as clear cut as to whether your friend is open or still considering getting professional help. This is where you have the advantage of being a supportive friend as it allows you to share your opinion in a tactful manner. Or it could just look like you being there for your friend whether this person is ready or not. This might be stressful for you too so remember to take care of yourself - allow yourself to express your emotions, be kind to yourself, and shift (to a more helpful) perspective, when necessary.
And hopefully your friend slowly feels more comfortable and open to try something different (talking to you, talking to a family member, sharing here with the community, talking to a professional, etc.). Know that your friend deserves and can get the support needed.

Everything has been going perfectly. My partner is amazing and supportive. I’ve even spoken to her about some of these issues and she’s been really patient dealing with them.
Despite all this, I keep having recurring thoughts like, no you don’t love her, she deserves better, it’s not going to last etc. Things like that. A big part of me knows that these are just intrusive thoughts. Like when you’re walking on the sidewalk and see traffic and your brain says “run into traffic DO IT”. Its just an intrusive thought.
But then comes the 2nd guessing, maybe its not that, maybe I am just not in a position to be in a relationship when my head is a mess. I keep arguing with myself about things like this. I tell myself, if I give up on this now, this will definitely happen again if I’m with someone else later on. What then?
So I’m really struggling to get such thoughts out of my head cause I don’t want them to come in the way of my happiness. I’m an anxious overthinker and I want to stop thinking. I just want to enjoy the nice things I have in life. This is probably the 3rd time I’ve had such an overthinking episode with doubts and everything. And the time in between, they never really leave. It’s when I think to myself, “Hey remember that thoughts I had? Is it gone yet?” That I start to spiral out of control again.

Thank you for sharing your worries, I hear you, and it sounds like you’re going through a really difficult time right now. Dealing with intrusive thoughts and constant self-doubt can be really very draining, especially when you’re in such a positive and supportive relationship. I really commend you for being open with your partner about these struggles, and I can tell that she cares deeply for you
I’d like you to know that these intrusive thoughts are just that—thoughts. They don’t define you or your relationship. You’re absolutely right in comparing them to passing traffic; they’re fleeting and not reflective of your true feelings or the reality of your situation!
However, I understand how difficult it can be to silence those thoughts, especially when they seem to linger and resurface at the most inconvenient times. It’s a constant battle between what you know logically and what your anxious mind tries to convince you of…
Perhaps you can try to focus on the present moment and the positive aspects of your relationship, for example trying mindfulness activities . You can also remind yourself of the love and support you receive from your partner, and give yourself permission to enjoy the happiness you’ve found together And whenever those intrusive thoughts arise, try to acknowledge them without judgment and gently guide your focus back to the reality of your loving relationship.
If it gets too overwhelming, I would encourage you to try speaking to a mental health professional to help you with strategies on overcoming these struggles. They’ll be there to journey with you. Here are some options you can try:

It’s really good to hear that you have a supportive partner. I feel like overthinking is somewhat ingrained in some of our personalities. If you’re an overthinker, you can distract yourself but you’ll fall back on overthinking many things. Even if you have a new partner, you’ll still overthink.
So I guess, hold on tight to your partner now and be thankful of the support she gives.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles - you sound like you’re losing hope and isolated. I’m sorry you’re going through this right now but whatever you’re thinking and feeling is valid given the circumstances
It sounds like you’re wishing for a situation where you no longer need to confront the distress or pain… First off, I wanna commend you on your self-awareness and courage - for wanting to do something about it and not giving up! You mentioned feeling afraid to tell people, I’m curious about that - what’s holding you back here? Also, what led to those thoughts? Are you able to see if it’s trying to let you know something - like a desire that’s not met? Or something got taken away?
I wonder when did you start feeling this way? Did something recently happen to you? I hope you’ll feel OK to share here as the community is willing to listen and support you. Sometimes, it helps to take a step back, take a deep breath and just notice your feelings for what it is, despite the discomfort. We try to see feelings as good or bad/should or should’nt have to help us know what to feel (or give us a sense of certainty). However, feelings are neither those (as those are our judgment that we place upon them) so we express them, hopefully in a manner that is healthy and helpful. What do you do to express your feelings, and when you’re feeling down?
At the same time, you can also try to be kind to yourself, and shift (to a more helpful) perspective. Not only that, it has been found helpful for our mood when we get some regular exercise, healthy and regular meals, stay hydrated, prioritise restful sleep, engage in a relaxing activity, practice gratitude, and stay connected to others. However, if you find it too distressing or overwhelming and you’re looking for professional assistance which is provided in a non-judgmental and safe setting, do consider:

- James Cook University Clinic

I hear you struggling with being left out and finding it hard to get to your usual social support for situations like this. I want to let you know that what you’re thinking and feeling is valid given your current circumstances. I wanna commend you on your self awareness regarding support system and the community here, including me, is more than willing to listen to what you’re gonna share.
Did something happen recently that led to this change with your school friends? Besides contacting your best friend, how else do you cope when things get too distressing? I can see that you value friendships a lot and that you put a high value on it. Humans are social creatures, so friendships is one of our ways to make connections, and with you being left out, there’s a huge disconnect in getting what you need.
Another helpful way is to carry out actions that are in line with your values - things that matter and are important to you. You can use this checklist to determine your values and note them down to identify what those values-driven action can be for you. If you select Connection, then it can be being open to communicate and being honest or true to yourself. And an open communication typically uses I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like done instead). This way, you can get your concerns across in a manner that your friends can listen and understand clearly.
At the same time, to help you bear the distress, perhaps you can consider expressing your feelings instead of having it bottle up inside you with nowhere to go. It could also be helpful to look at things from a different perspective and to be kind to yourself through this difficult time. Let us know what you think. Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need.

Thanks for coming on here for support and sharing about your struggles with feeling worthless and changing habits. It also sounds like this has been going on for awhile in many areas of your life which must also make it very tiring for you. I want to let you know that what you’re thinking and feeling is valid given the circumstances.
I’m curious to know when do you feel this way? Does it occur after an incident (are you able to notice any patterns here)? And what do you do next? I wonder if these actions relate to the habits (what would that be, btw) you mentioned? Is it similar for the difficulties yiu face and those involving others (like your marriage)? Sometimes the way we think, affects the way we act and feel. Perhaps a shift in perspective might help.
It sounds like you’re also drained and overwhelmed. I’m curious when you mentioned a lack of empathy - what do you mean by that? You’re right about old habits kicking in immediately as it probably served you well before this. Instead of changing habits which is difficult, let’s consider having alternative helpful habits that you can shape (catch yourself, “Hey, instead of doing… maybe I can try…"") and reinforce (reward yourself when you engage in it) so that those can kick in as well.
What do you tend to do to cope? It’s helpful to be able to express your thoughts and feelings, and perhaps towards the people that matter. You can be kinder to yourself and express your feelings in a helpful manner. Another helpful way is to carry out actions that are in line with your values - things that matter and are important to you. You can use this checklist to determine your values and note them down to identify what those values-driven action can be for you. If you select Connection, then it can be being open to communicate and being honest or true to yourself. However, if you still find yourself facing difficulties to cope and would like to seek further support, do consider professional help that is done in a non-judgmental and safe setting to help you express and develop more positive coping skills:

I like the people around me, my relationships (romantically/ platonic), my workplace and colleagues.
But sometimes I feel like crying, and I feel bad about myself. How “weak” or emotional I am. Especially after I had a few quarrels w my mum/ bf this year (we don’t usually quarrel).
I want to discuss my thoughts with people - but I’m afraid of burdening them because I know we are all busy with our own lives (I’m in late 20s), but I do still crave for the connection, and of course, I do pour out to them sometimes…
When my friends or bf hear me out, I feel relieved but at the same time, I feel bad for “burdening” them. And I dislike/ feel uncomfy with the idea that they might be more sensitive with how they act/ talk around me (like being more attentive to my mood). I’m also worried that this is an unhealthy dependence, and I don’t want that. At times I also feel guilty for letting others worry about me.
I want to help myself, but sometimes I don’t know how and I feel tired at times and thoughts about how the world would go on/ do well without me pops up. I also have a bad habit of self-harm when I feel overwhelmed with emotions. I’m worried that this is a sign of mental illness, and I also wonder if I’m just overthinking things.
When I’m fine, I’m okay and can go on with life happily (genuinely), doing things I like.

Thanks for sharing with us your struggles, I hear you… It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of conflicting emotions and thoughts, and it’s completely valid to feel that way. Even though you’re often seen as a happy-go-lucky person by those around you, it’s okay to have moments of vulnerability and sadness. You’re not weak for feeling this way .
I can understand that you are worried about burdening others with your feelings and I can see that you care deeply about your relationships and want to maintain a sense of independence and balance. It’s okay to seek help and support from others without feeling like you’re overly dependent on them. It’s also important to address any harmful coping mechanisms, like self-harm, and to recognize that these behaviors may be a sign that you need additional support.
I highly encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional who can support you directly and share with you strategies to manage your feelings. Please contact either one of these options soon:

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, I hear you and I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling alone and depressed. I can hear that you’re experiencing a sense of isolation, especially as your friends have become less available. I can understand that you prefer meaningful relationships over superficial connections (I do too!), and it can be tough when those connections feel scarce.
Even though you have positive things in your life like a decent job, fitness, and hobbies, it’s clear that these things aren’t filling the void you’re experiencing. It’s okay to feel this way, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.
Perhaps you can share more about this through reflecting on the questions below:
2. What specific activities or situations used to bring you joy or a sense of connection with others before you started feeling this way?
3. Can you identify any patterns or triggers in your interactions with your friends or in your daily routine that might be contributing to your feelings of loneliness and depression?
If you’re open to it, it might be helpful to seek emotional support from a therapist near you, so that you can have a safe space to explore these feelings and work towards finding more fulfilling connections in your life. You can try these options below:

Thanks for coming on here and sharing about being stressed out that it’s overwhelming you. I want to let you know that what you’re feeling and thinking about it is valid given what you’re going through. And we’re definitely here to listen to you
You mentioned not doing very well. How long has this been going on for you? Did something happen to you? I wonder if it’s also affecting other areas of your life besides work. I can see how anxiety provoking and tiring this must be for you With anxiety, I wonder if there’s something you’re worried or needing to prepare for? I wonder if this uncertainty then leads you to take actions to reduce the discomfort as soon as you can. Also, there are a variety of reasons for anxiety that range from physical/health concerns, financial problems, being evaluated, conflicts/disgreements, certain medications, unhelpful attitude to personal triggers.
With the feedback you received about work, were you able to express your side of things? When you communicate assertively, you’re doing it to get your needs heard before working together to achieve a win-win scenario that benefits you and your employers. I also wonder how you cope when things get overwhelming for you? Are you able to engage in some of those activities/actions? I think it will be helpful if you are able to express your emotions in a helpful manner, being kinder to yourself during tough times, and shifting perspective. And perhaps speaking to someone you trust can provide support as well as allow you to be heard.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with romantic relationships. It must’ve been devastating with the break-up although being ablee to rekindle must’ve felt like a second chance at things. I wanna let you know that what you’re thinking and feeling is valid given the circumstances. However, you being overwhelmed and not taking care of yourself is rather worrying
Humans are hardwired to seek connections, and in romantic connection, one can get comfort, passion in shared values and goals. There’s something valuable in that relationship that you keep returning to… Perhaps looking inwards to see what those desired needs are, and to discover if they can be fulfilled in other ways ?
Consider the things you value in a relationship and list them down - this helps you to figure out:
- What do you look for: List the things you want in your main relationships. Then, ask yourself how you contribute to the things you want. For example, if you want honesty in your relationships, honesty is likely one of your values.
- What are your deal-breakers: List the things you can’t/won’t tolerate in your relationships. Then, ask yourself how you can behave to avoid those deal-breakers. For example, if you don’t want dishonesty that’s another way to recognize that honesty is one of your values.
- How must you change to attract these kinds of people: Although we can’t choose all of our relationships, like parents and relatives, we can play a role in attracting our friends and romantic partners. Imagine the kind of people you want to be around, then identify the values you’d like to exemplify in that company. For example, if you want supportive friends, then being a supportive friend may be one of your values.
At the same time, I wonder what goes through your mind to feel like isolating and sorta ‘punishing’ yourself as it feels like you’re trying to meet some need or unmet desire? Have you found yourself engaging in this pattern of behaviours before? How did you cope in the past? Considering in the long run that this might not be helpful behaviours, I wonder if you can be kinder to yourself, and shift (to a more helpful) perspective ? Have you also the chance to speak to someone you trust, to share your feelings and seek support? Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need. Hope to hear back from you.

That’s perfectly fine I think. When I ended one of my relationships in the past, I enjoyed the solitude and peace too (even though I was heartbroken).
There’s just something about being able to reflect by yourself and see things in a perspective that you can’t when you’re in a relationship.
Maybe what would be helpful for you is to take things in your own pace. Don’t rush into another relationship (or have those rebounds). Take your time to explore the world.", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-keep-coming-back-to-my-ex/9010/3,0,,13565,,,13565

9012,Where to seek mental help if school is not an option?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/where-to-seek-mental-help-if-school-is-not-an-option/9012,Seeking Help,"needadvice, mentalhealth",7141,Origin,User,,13525,1,"Hi, I came across this website today and I wanted to ask where could I seek help at?
Currently, I am a secondary school student in sec 4 and the stress from the upcoming exams and the toxic environment is causing me a lot of stress. Although I am trying to ignore the enviroment around me(the bad stuff) I srsly can’t and nowadays my crying outbreaks are getting worse from crying about something small to crying when nothing happened.
To add on, I have been thinking about death everyday like personally I would not do it but like I cannot handle the sadness and emptiness in me any longer considering that I have been facing these feelings through out my whole secondary life (close to 4 years), including sucidical thoughts. Idk whether its normal but yeah ig. Also mg mood goes up and down quite a lot, like for a week I could feel happy like Im on yk meds but the mext week I could feel like empty and if a bad situation comes, I would feel sad, angry and Sucidical all at the same time :<
If you are wondering why I can’t seek help at school, its because firstly, the process is too lengthy and my form teacher do not give a ■■■■ about my mental health until it gets to the worse point(breaking down at school, which is uncontrollable). This process would start with 3 sessions with the form teacher then the form teacher will see whether the student needs to see the councillor. Next, the form teacher will inform the yearhead and the the yearhead will get in contact with the student and evaluate whether they need mental help or not. Then finally, I can meet with the school councillor when I get an appointment. This process is way too long for me and I would probably have overdosed on painkillers before I could even get help
Apologies for the sucide joke but I am being somewhat serious though, the process will probably take a earliest one month and with a form teacher who is irresponsible, maybe even never. Also, I know school councillors have to tell the teachers and the parents about the session and I prefer my session with the person I spoke to to be private and undisclosed. I also come from a middle-lower income family so I don’t have many options when it comes to seeking help because I don’t have much money for it
This is a very important year for me since I have the very big exam at the mid-end of the year, and I need to work on my results but my mental health is being a barrier from that.
Will appreciate any help or advice for my mental health and where to seek help, Thanks!

Thank you so much for sharing with us your struggles, you’ve come to the right place and I hear you - I want to acknowledge the weight you’re carrying on your shoulders. It sounds like you’re going through a storm of stress and emotions, and it’s really so brave of you to reach out and express what you’re going through.
Feeling overwhelmed by exams and a toxic environment is a heavy burden, and it’s understandable that it’s taking a toll on your mental health. I’m honestly concerned to hear about the intensity of your crying spells and the persistent thoughts of death and suicide. These are definitely signals that your mental health needs attention and care.
The fact that seeking help at your school feels like a huge obstacle is disheartening. The process you described seems daunting and drawn-out, leaving you feeling trapped in your struggles. It’s unfair that accessing support should feel so inaccessible and prolonged, especially when you’re in such urgent need.
I’m here to tell you that your feelings are valid. You mentioned concerns about privacy and affordability when seeking help. There are community organizations, hotlines, and online resources that offer confidential support at little to no cost. I’ll list some here for you to try them out:

before i met him, i was searching up ways to become more likable, and i have started to ask more questions during my conversations with people to make sure they feel heard. Although i do enjoy listening to him talking about himself, i want to talk about myself too :(. i mean everyone likes talking about themselves no?!!! However, every time i do talk about myself, i find him either ignoring me completely and continuing to talk about other things, or replying dryly, making me feel that im boring him.
i understand i do think im quite a boring person, and maybe he doesn’t know how to reply me, but i can’t help but feel sad that he “doesn’t care” about anything i say about myself!
i have actually brought it up once when he asked me if he had any cons. i mentioned that he was not a great listener, but i also foolishly said that i didn’t mind it as i prefer listening :(. i feel like i should’ve established the fact that i like being heard too at that point.
i really want him to realise how upset this makes me feel, almost like a one sided friendship. but i feel like confronting him head on will strain our friendship more than the good it’ll bring.

Sounds like you’re having a tough time with a friend and getting your point across. I recall how important friendships are to you given it’s value for you; and how your value-driven actions are in line with making genuine connections and being a good friend to him - you put yourself out there (like researching how to become more likeable, working on conversation skills, etc.) despite the risks. You are being true to who you are and want to be!
I wanna commend you for your efforts and also acknowledge that you did bring it up when there was an opportunity! I’m heartened to hear you giving more emphasis on active listening as we try to listen to understand instead of listening to respond (like formulating your next question/comment, trying to ‘read’ the person’s mind, etc.).
It also sounds like you engaged in a some pros-and-cons where you were considering tackling the situation head-on or just keeping things the same. Bringing it up sounds like the way to go so let’s minimise stress/barriers on your end and maximise likelihood for acceptance on the other end (remember you can’t control how other’s behave but you can influence them). Perhaps this could look like, if you haven’t already, writing down what you want to say to use as reference. Picking a time and place where there’s minimal distractions/interruptions ensures both parties are calm. You can then get yourself heard by sharing your thoughts using I-statements: “I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like said/done instead)”. This way, you can get your concerns across and in a manner that he can listen and understand clearly.
I also wanna bring up a possibility of a scenario where after you try speaking to him, things continue to remain the same - like a 1-sided friendship What will you do then - perhaps this is where you carry out actions that align with your values by trying to be a good friend yet wanting to not be neglected. Most importantly is to express your emotions in a helpful manner and to be kind to yourself!

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles getting caught up in overwhelming emotions that’s affecting yourself and your relationships. I want to let you know that what you’re thinking and feeling is valid given the circumstances.
I think you’re quite an empathetic person as you can feel how your workplace colleagues feel - like you say, “in their shoes”. This gives you the ability to have meaningful connections with others, although it also means understanding what the other person goes through (like high amount of work stress and constantly on edge) - which is a double-edged sword. Some very empathetic people tend to experience this pretty subconsciously, and it’s not done deliberately - unless doing so serves a function - perhaps to avoid something or gain something they’re lacking/not experiencing at the moment…
I wonder if you’ve experienced something like what you’re going through now before? This sorta sounds like you’re running low on your emotional cup , and if you’re pouring from an empty cup, I think it would make sense for you to feel drained and quick to be irritated due to your empathy. You’re right that this is tiring and finding it tough to be there for others especially with your partner. Perhaps this is a signal for you to take a step back, be kind to yourself, and shift (to a more helpful) perspective .
Have you had a chance to speak to others about this - to get support for yourself from those you trust and can help you, like your partner? An open and honest conversation using I statements: *I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like done)*can help you get your concerns across and in a manner that others can listen and understand clearly.
What do you think about this? I hope you’re able to express your emotions in a helpful manner, and that you get to refill your cup back. Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need.

Usually when they share, I will try to see from their perspective and the emotions that comes along with it to understand what they are going through and provide support when necessary. However sometimes, this happens automatically even without them talking to me about it. I can simply see the work group chat active at night and I will feel stress and sad for my colleagues who have to deal with them. I see people post about sad things, I will feel sad with them.
I think for work wise, I also feel guilty since I am the only one in the company with a role that don’t need to face those issues. Although there are a lot of challenges and struggles for my role as well, to everyone, it seems like I got the better end of things. Sometimes, they will say things like “You are lucky you don’t have to face that” and I know I am but I can’t peacefully enjoy it too. In the end, there’s pressure from my own workload, stress gathered from sympathising others and also feeling bad that I’m the “lucky” one.
For relationship wise, I’m grateful that my partner is someone who is very understanding, despite him not being able to relate when I mentioned a bit about it before. However, I feel like work stress and other issues will never end and I shouldn’t keep using my poor emotional and mental state as an excuse for not being able to be fully present for my partner or my family.",,0,,,,,

Thanks for sharing with us authentically about your struggles, I hear you, and it sounds like you’re going through a tough time with social interactions, and I’m really sorry to hear that. Feeling like you’re running out of things to say or experiencing a mind blank can be frustrating, especially when it affects your ability to connect with others. I can also understand that you might feel pressure to present yourself in a certain way to avoid judgment or rejection, which can make opening up about personal struggles even more difficult.
Here are a couple of suggestions that might help
2. Try to practice Active Listening Sometimes, the pressure to keep the conversation going can be alleviated just by actively listening to the other person! You can ask open-ended questions about their experiences, interests, and thoughts, and genuinely engage with what they’re saying. This can take some of the pressure off you to constantly come up with new topics and also helps build a deeper connection with the other person.
3. **Try to find common ground While it’s natural to feel left out when others discuss relationship experiences you can’t relate to, try to focus on finding common ground in other areas. You can even start by saying something like “I noticed that we both enjoy …” or “Wow I like that too!” It can be shared interests, hobbies, or life goals, highlighting what you do have in common can help bridge the gap and help you find meaningful connections without dwelling on what you perceive as shortcomings.
Remember, it’s okay to take things at your own pace and to only share what you feel comfortable with. Authenticity is so important in building genuine relationships, and people who appreciate your quirks and accept you for who you are will be worth getting to know And please know that it’s completely normal to have periods of struggle with social interactions, and you’re not alone in feeling this way!

Thank you for sharing your feelings with us here, I can hear the frustration and uncertainty in your words, and it’s completely understandable. Graduating from school and stepping into the job market can feel like an overwhelming transition, especially when faced with the pressure to build a portfolio and find your place in your desired field. It’s actually super common to struggle with confidence during this time (I did too!), especially if you’ve faced rejection or setbacks like the internship rejection you mentioned.
When we feel a lack of urgency or motivation, it can sometimes be a result of feeling overwhelmed or unsure of where to start. It also sounds like you’re already taking steps to explore your interests and skills through your part-time job at the cafe, particularly with the social media and video editing tasks. Finding aspects of your work that you enjoy, like video editing, is a good sign, even if you feel like you’re not progressing as quickly as you’d like. Remember, every skill takes time and practice to develop.
Here are a few suggestions that you can try for yourself:
2. Break Down Your Goals When you feel overwhelmed, it might be helpful to break down your goals into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, if you’re working on the portfolio, you can start by outlining the sections you want to include or gathering examples of your work. Breaking things down like this makes it easier to stay focused and makes progress feel more achievable
3. Seek Feedback! It’s okay to not feel confident in your work sometimes, especially when it comes to something new like video editing. Sometimes, seeking feedback from others can provide valuable insights and help you to improve.
4. Practice Self-Compassion It’s important to remember that it’s okay to not have everything figured out right away. You’re still learning and growing, and that’s perfectly normal. Instead of being too hard on yourself for not being where you want to be, try to practice self-compassion and acknowledge the progress you’ve made so far. Celebrating even small victories can help keep you motivated and moving forward!
I hope that these suggestions can benefit you in some way, please do try them out and keep us updated on how you’re coping. We’re here for you!

Hmmm but jokes aside its okay to take things step by step at your own pace. Keep trying and eventually you will see that you’ve gone pretty far If you are tired then take a break to recharge and step aside from the task for a while. If you are stuck it might be good to find people you can learn from ? Online communities on discord or reddit may help give inspiration as well.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles, it must be really difficult to relocate and being overwhelmed with work until it’s badly affecting your sleep. Whatever you’re currently feeling and thinking is valid given your circumstances.
Firstly, I wanna commend you on your courage to take up a role that moved you away from home - that probably wasn’t a very straight-forward decision and that thoughts of you ‘being weak’ is probably being viewed through a very narrow lens at the moment due to stress and the very tough nature of your role.
And I think the most important thing now is to help you with your lack of sleep as that is definitely going to affect not just your productivity but your health. I also understand that there’s strong reasons that you can’t move out of this role at the moment. So, let’s deal with the most immediate concern by trying to get proper rest (to stop and break the cycle of not getting proper rest) by negotiating with your company on a schedule/timing that allows for breaks and perhaps additional staff support/experienced team members?
I’m heartened that you’ve spoken to your colleagues as it’s important to have allies, as it’s going to be very difficult to go on this on your own. I wonder if your organisation has any support in the form of Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that can help with resolving problems for yourself and the company? An open conversation where everyone’s not in a hurry with you sharing your thoughts using I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like done instead).

Unfortunately being in a startup, such welfare and benefits do not come by easily. There’s not even overtime pay. I guess a consolation to me is I have an understanding immediate supervisor. As much as he too is struggling with his work, he is emotionally more connected to us than the bosses and HR. I did bring up multiple times the important to hire more resources to help manage the work load but the management isn’t doing anything about it. They care more about you being in the office and adhering to the WFH schedule when most of us are constantly out due to client meetings.
I feel frustrated and anxious when things don’t get done and I understand that these things are beyond my control and I shouldn’t let it affect me. However, it’s so hard to compartmentalize these emotions. I tried mediation, it worked for a bit until it didn’t. I tried going for jogs to tire myself out but the adrenaline after the run kept me going.

I am a Christian, married for two years. I am struggling with alcohol dependency and many arguments between my wife and I have been centered around me drinking too much.
The lastest incident, I drank with a colleague after work and lied to my wife that I was going home. She found out the next morning and I am devastated because I have taken her last forgiveness and trust for granted.
I hope I can find a solution to break out of this cycle, and build a secure home for my family.

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us, I hear you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it took to share this with me. I can hear that you’re facing a difficult challenge, and it’s clear that you deeply care about your marriage and family. Struggling with alcohol dependency is tough, and it can have a big impact on relationships.
It’s understandable that your wife’s trust has been shaken by these incidents, but I’m proud to hear that you recognize the need to break out of this cycle. I have 3 suggestions here for you to try:
2. Seek Professional Help - Please consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction. They can provide you with a listening ear and guide you with specific strategies to help you overcome this alcohol issue, and also help you to manage the habit of lying to your wife, and most importantly improve your relationships. You can try walking in or calling a nearby Family Service Centre (click on the link to find one near your home).
3. Open and Honest Communication - It’s really important to have open and honest communication with your wife about your struggles with alcohol. I feel it is also important to apologize sincerely for the times you’ve let her down and reassure her of your commitment to change, as having transparency and accountability can help rebuild trust in your relationship.
4. Explore Healthy Coping Mechanisms - I encourage you to identify healthier ways to cope with stress or difficult emotions that don’t involve alcohol. This could include finding new hobbies or activities that bring you joy, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation, or engaging in regular exercise to improve your physical and mental well-being. I personally feel that having physical activities (like sports) can help to take off the mental load and also redirect your energy in a healthy way, which can eventually help you reduce your alcohol reliance.
Last but not least, I want to affirm you that trust takes time and effort, but it’s possible with commitment and a willingness to change. Please do remember to be gentle with yourself as you tread gently through this process, and know that it’s okay to ask for help along the way.
Let us know how you’re coping and if you’ve tried any of the suggestions.

I was bullied for my weight in secondary school which led me to be more active in the gym and sports (for a year). Ever since then, somehow I lost motivation completely and grown super conscious about my body shape, a lumpy belly and man breasts… Everytime i buy clothes, the contours of my lumpiness makes me feel even more terribly. Somehow I cannot muster up the discipline and motivation to bring myself to overcome this, especially with an impending NS looming.

Thanks for sharing with us your struggles, I hear you… I can see that you’re going through a really difficult time, and I want you to know that it’s completely okay to feel overwhelmed by these feelings. Bullying can have long-lasting effects on our self-esteem and body image, and it’s understandable that you’re struggling to find motivation and discipline to overcome these challenges, especially with the looming pressure of impending responsibilities like NS.
It’s important to be gentle with yourself and to know that it’s okay to not feel okay sometimes. Building motivation and discipline takes time, and it’s okay to take small steps towards your goals, even if it feels like progress is slow. The most important thing is to be consistent.
Here are a couple of suggestions that might help:
2. Focus on Small Wins Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, try setting small, achievable goals for yourself! This could be something as simple as committing to going for a short 15 min walk every day or doing a quick workout session in your home gym. Celebrating these small victories can help boost your confidence and motivation over time.
3. Seek Support! Please know that you don’t have to go through this alone. Please do consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor who can provide you with support and encouragement. They can offer a listening ear, provide helpful advice, and help you stay accountable to your goals You can even get them to accompany you on your exercise trips to help you stay consistent too!

I’ve picked up exercising as a coping mechanism and I started to realise a shift. From wanting to workout as a form of break from school, work and anxiety, I started to see workouts as a way to stay slim, fit and healthy. I started to exercise more, and when the time of the month comes, I rest and I eat… a lot… and recently I’ve been having super negative thoughts about how I look especially since I started to see signs of me gaining weight.

Ever since I gained and now that I’ve been yo-yo between 51-53kg, I feel anxious when I see it go from 52kg to 53kg and I get super worried if it hits 54kg.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with your eating habits and attitudes towards your self. I also hear you about your anxious feelings and recognising that your thoughts about your weight might not be helpful. No matter, your thoughts and feelings given your circumstances are valid.
You mentioned that this is not your first episode - are you able to recognise what might had let you to develop this attitude towards your looks and your weight? What about tasks and anxious feelings that you were trying to break from? It must’ve been very overwhelming for you during those periods. I hear you about developing positive habits although they gotta be healthy and that it will be more helpful if self-worth is not just tied to weight or shape; instead things that matter to you like values and values-driven goals - that could help shift the focus away from weight gain/numbers on the scale.
In the meantime, we can perhaps consider alternative ways to cope with overwhelming emotions and unhelpful thinking by expressing your emotions in a helpful manner, being kind to yourself, and shifting (to a more helpful) perspective.
Whether your body image (concerns about your physical appearance and distressing emotions) and eating is considered disordered, it will be best to have an assessment by a qualified professional that takes into account your history, the duration and intensity of the distress, signs/symptoms associated with the disorder, etc. So one of the first steps could be a referral from polyclinic for a clinical assessment which will details the sort of treatment and support that matches your needs.
I would think that there’s more you’re able to share about what you’re going through and that I’m curious to hear what you think about all of this.

But if you lose too much in a short period, your body will try to compensate and bring it back up to the body set weight. Similarly if you gain too much weight in a short time, your body will try to curb your appetite and bring it down too.
Maybe instead of focusing on just pure numbers, can focus more on how you feel instead? I think exercise is a great way to cope and if that makes you feel happy then can do more - just try not to binge eat after exercising, otherwise it’s counterintuitive.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your feelings with us, it is always welcomed here! I hear you, and it sounds like you’re carrying a heavy weight on your shoulders, and it’s understandable to feel hesitant about sharing your struggles with your friends, especially when you’re concerned about burdening them. I can see that you value your friendships deeply, and you want to preserve them while also finding a way to go through your own challenges. Bottling up your emotions and pretending to be okay on the outside while feeling sad and lonely inside is a heavy burden to bear.
It’s great that you’re already seeing a therapist to address your anxiety-related issues, but it’s unfortunate that you’re not feeling completely comfortable with your current therapist. It’s natural to miss the connection and sense of safety you had with your previous therapist. Change can be difficult, especially when it comes to something as personal as therapy.
If you feel comfortable, you could try expressing your concerns to your current therapist. They might be able to adjust their approach to make you feel more at ease, or they could help you explore other options for therapy that might be a better fit for you.
Additionally, would you like to consider changing therapist? It’s perfectly okay to find one that suits you, and to choose a therapist that you feel comfortable with - that’s the whole point of therapy right? Therapy won’t be useful if you bottle things up and don’t feel comfortable. I would highly recommend that you keep trying out different therapists until you find one that you are comfortable with, then continue with that person. It’s completely okay to search and try and ‘test’ until you get one (Yes, you’re hearing this from a therapist - and you’re definitely allowed to do this )
Perhaps it might also be helpful to explore different ways of expressing yourself and finding support. Have you considered joining a support group or seeking out online communities where you can connect with others who may be going through similar experiences? Sometimes, sharing with people who understand can alleviate the feeling of loneliness and provide more support
Let us know how your journey in searching for a therapist that you’re comfortable with goes, and hopefully you’ll find one that suits you - and then you can process your emotions about the friendship issues as well.

I agree with what cottonsoul said about sharing with your current therapist about how you feel regarding the sessions so that your therapist can either change the way he carries out sessions or maybe even refer you to another therapist who you might feel more comfortable with !
On another note, I really understand what you mean when you share about not wanting to burden your close friends with your problems, cos I felt that too at one point of time. I think one way I overcame this fear was to check in with my friend first before ranting or sharing with them about my problems. For example, I’ll text them and ask “Hey, are you free now? I kinda want someone to rant to.” or “Hey, do you have the mental capacity to listen to me rant?”. This way, you give your friends to option to reject you if they feel that they don’t have the mental capacity to give you their attention for you to rant to.

Thanks for the response!
I do value my friendships ( or relationships in general ) alot, so I tend not to share my inner woes and sorrows with those around me aside from the usual complains in life. Sometimes you just want to see the people around you happy and not be worried and fussing over you right ?
Yeah I’ve thought of changing therapists before but then I realize that I’d have to go through the entire “warmup” process with them every time I see someone new ( changed twice already ) , and it gets tiring having to repeat everything over and over again over the course of a few sessions. I do know that the main point of therapy is to be comfortable letting things out and having someone to be listening to me rant and all, but I’m rather introverted and shy and it takes me a long time to open up so I think ill need some time to figure it out with the current one. I will definitely try my best for that ! Change is something that I struggle with alot
Also, I’ve considered contacting / keeping in touch with my previous therapist ( through social media because I have no other means) , and hopefully see if she was still providing therapy but I read that ethically and professionally its not appropriate to do so so I’ve kinda shoved that thought away.
Good news ( or so I hope ) is, that I do express myself out to my friends in my crazy and quirky mannerisms, and also I do try my best to invest my free time into things that make me happy! I might consider joining some support groups and communities but I think I’ll have to wait till I’m a little more free ( I’m a workaholic as well but I complain about work so :') ) I guess this community is also a place I can turn to

Thank for coming on and sharing about your struggles with hair-pulling. It must be very distressing to struggle with the uncontrollable urge to pull and trying your best to stop, and then I imagine getting really stressed over the effects…
You shared that this had been going on for some time - do you notice any patterns or situations where it seems to happen more than usual? I wonder if it’s associated with any particular stressor(s)? I’m curious to hear how you’re currently coping - have you spoken to someone about this before? Having an outlet to vent your distress will likely be helpful so that it doesn’t get bottled up to the point of overwhelming you. In the meantime, I hope you’re able to express your emotions in a helpful manner, being kind to yourself, and shifting (to a more helpful) perspective.
As trichotillomania falls under the broad umbrella of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders due to the repetitive behaviours you (compulsively) need to do, I wonder if you’ve seen anyone about this too as trichotillomania treatment is usually provided in a healthcare setting by psychiatrists or mental health professionals, involving working through some of your unhelpful beliefs that sustain this behaviour and/or learning skills to reverse this habit (potentially replacing with something more helpful). There might be instances also where medication might be considered to manage your mood (e.g., overly anxious, depressed mood, etc.) to help with implementing the new skills. Perhaps a referral from polyclinic could be something to consider, or support from professional services by engaging with Family Service Centres.

She asked who is one inspirational woman in my life? And how did she inspire me? I said my mom and then I paused for a very long while (and this was in front of my classmates). I couldn’t think of how she inspires me, even though she has been caring for me and the family as a homemaker for the past 20+ years… I wouldn’t say her sacrifice has inspired me because I sometimes feel that she doesn’t want to be doing it…she has OCD, which has sometimes made living at home quite unwelcoming, she used to be very critical too, causing me to walk on eggshells, I think I get anxious around her too. My family members and I have tried for many years to help her out of her ocd but I’m afraid if she doesn’t want to, we can’t do anything. I’m approaching my 30s… and finally moving out soon as I’m getting married! Hooray to no more living with OCD rules! But at the same time I feel like i have mother wounds? Like today’s episode made me so sad that I ended up crying when I got home. Is there something I can do to heal? Thank you for reading until here one of my greatest fears is becoming like my mom (sorry if I sound like I don’t appreciate her efforts, I do, but I don’t have a good relationship with her because I feel like she’s emotionally unavailable?)",,2,,,,,

Hmm I hear you, sometimes I’m afraid of adopting my parent’s negative habits or traits after staying with them for so long but I have also realised that actually I do have some good traits from my parents too, like my dad’s generosity and my mom’s hardworking attitude
So what are some good traits which you have got from your mom ?
I think moving out from that environment could be a good opportunity for you to reset and have some space to heal and I think if we ever find ourselves slipping towards these bad habits its good to have gentle reminders from our close ones to get us back on track.

Congrats
I can feel that sense of relief and somewhat of a liberation. I think you don’t have to conform to society’s standards that all mums are great. There are some that aren’t so great.
I didn’t have a good relationship with my mum as well and I was really excited to move out when I finally became an adult.
Not sure what will help but I think when you finally move out, you might appreciate your mum a bit more. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. My heart didn’t exactly grow fonder after I moved out but I think my relationship with my mum definitely improved.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your relationship struggles living with your mother all these years. I want to let you know that what you’re thinking and feeling is valid given your circumstances - you’ll find that this community is very willing to listen and support you
It sounds very difficult and tiring to be cautious and needing to withstand all the uncertainty, especially given your mom’s diagnosis OCD She sounds like she tried hard despite the distress she faced and hearing how you and your family tried to help her too.
You mentioned something about mother wounds… I wonder if there were times where you felt that you had to take care of yourself (kinda like being your own parent) when she was unable to do so? Your self-awareness can be a valuable strength here to guide you to notice certain negative emotions (e.g., anger, resentment, sadness) as a response to what you did not experience and what you seek out for. And perhaps you can provide yourself those attachment and emotional needs by acknowledging your emotions (they are neither good nor bad, they just are) and working through them (e.g., being comfortable expressing them, letting go of unhelpful beliefs, strengthen positive coping skills, etc.). You can consider these practices, if you haven’t already been engaging in them:
- Being kind to yourself
- Shifting (to a more helpful) perspective
I’m also heartened to hear that you’ll be able to have your own place (and congrats on getting married! ). You mentioning seeking to heal - I wonder what sorta things do you wish to be different? I would imagine that your mom might still be a part of it and that changes might not come immediately (e.g., given how OCD symptoms can be managed but not cured) - although your relationship with her can be ‘different’ as you set boundaries and aligning it with what you find important and value. This might be akin to a grieving process as you go through ‘losing the old relationship’ to developing something different/more helpful to meet your needs. And in your journey, remember to engage in positive coping skills especially when you notice yourself starting to feel overwhelmed; if you find yourself struggling to cope with the distress, you can consider professionals that can support you in a non-judgmental manner and in a safe setting such as Family Service Centres.

Just to share mine that has taken away Most of my confidence and Self Believe.
Growing up, even some of my teacher told me I am an “ Airhead” ( Nothing inside the brain ) .However, I manage to teach myself Greek Alphabet and Numbers up to 20 and Identify different languages like Futhark ( Viking’s Alphabet) and all other things that interest me like finding out that the Nepal Flag is the most odd shape flag in the world. Even when i became a certified Aircraft Technician with a 3.58 GPA I was made fun of and it seemed that no matter how i tried to prove myself that I am not dumb remarks were being made. I empathise with people who try to win their parent’s approval all their lives and forgo their real interest.
In my teens,I met a gal from the internet and shared whatever little interesting things I knew. She turned her cheek away in the cab after learning that I do not have the cash to splurge. I went home, with sand in my feet, and just cried on my pillow to sleep. It wasn’t because I didn’t get the girl but I had never felt so looked down apoun. I felt so insignificant, small and worthless. I still remember that feeling to this day of how broken I felt and that Money, Status, Popularity, the 5Cs etc is all the rave with the world and not the heart of someone.
Fast forward to a few years back, I made friends with a 55 year old lady whom made me feel just as bad. In the 8 years of knowing her, she moulded me to be someone that she could marry. I am not attracted to her that way - Just wanted to be friends but I felt so sick to my stomach that I am “ Not good enough the way I am “. Not even for a frumpy old lady. Only when i realised after a mutual friend pointed it out, that I woke up and realised that I do not know who I am anymore.
I struggle to find my confidence back in myself after that happened.
Don’t get me started about my physical appearance. Cause I learned that society is very shallow. I have a belly due to medication - weight gain in antipsychotics and been made fun of and judged by family,friends and general public.Be too skinny and people will tell you to eat more, Be too chubby they ask you to lose weight and eat a salad. What i learned is that just be contented and love who you are in the moment and even if you want to lose or gain a few extra pounds, it should be on your terms and for you. Not to impress others.
The thing is, Judgement from people we value their opinions is what will affect us the most. There is no wrong in trying to improve but it should not come at the cost of losing one’s confidence or self essence or winning approval.
Among my fear’s is being self deluded. Thinking that there is nothing wrong with me and that I am Enough. What I understand is that Nobody is perfect and we all have flaws. It’s actually to embrace ourselves with all the flaws that we have. There is a time and place to self improve however it is not saying we do not do anything at all to improve but knowing that we should love ourselves enough to move ahead in life.
Honestly I think the fear of being self deluded is also fear of being judged by other people. At the end of the day, when we are by ourselves, we should love who we are.Gaining the Confidence back is a process of self love and not minding if people thinks that we’re deluded.

Thanks for opening up and sharing about the path you have taken to be where you are right now It certainly does not sound smooth-sailing and the experience you’ve accumulated have taught you a lot regarding self-esteem. I can’t imagine how it must’ve felt hearing the things people have said to you or done towards to you that had shattered your self-confidence… However, I also see your resilience on display as I sense you bouncing back and taking charge of your life (cue the song)!
I count countless gems from your anecdotes in terms of working hard for your interests, self-awareness to work on your mental health, being kind to yourself, and the insight to know what’s really important for yourself! I really like your phrase “the fear of being self deluded is also fear of being judged by other people” which is 2-sides of the same coin. Your ability to take perspective here is a great strength that you can harness when you start to feel overwhelmed with distress.

At the same time, I hope that you’re also taking care of yourself and getting regular exercise, getting healthy and regular meals, staying hydrated, prioritising restful sleep, engaging in a relaxing activity, setting goals/priorities, practicing gratitude, focusing on positivity, and staying connected.

Thank you for sharing your concerns with us, I hear you. I want to assure you that many people also experience realistic dreams. Sometimes, experiencing vivid and realistic dreams, especially ones that closely relate to your daily experiences and emotions, can be caused by stress or emotional upheaval. It doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s something wrong with you, but it could be a reflection of your mind processing and trying to make sense of the events and feelings you’re experiencing during the day
However, if these dreams are causing you distress or interfering with your daily life, it might be helpful to explore coping strategies or seek support from a therapist or counselor. They can help you understand the underlying causes of these dreams and provide help on how to manage them effectively so that you can carry on with your day better.
In the meantime, I encourage you to start practicing relaxation techniques before bed, such as deep breathing or meditation, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule might help improve the quality of your sleep and reduce the intensity of your dreams

I hear you. It sounds like you’re going through a lot, and I can completely understand how it feels to be worried about how others might perceive your emotions. It’s tough when people try to dismiss your feelings with well-meaning but ultimately unhelpful words like “cheer up.” Your emotions are valid, and it’s okay to feel how you feel.
As for your habit of plucking your skin, it seems like it might be a way for you to cope with something, maybe stress or anxiety. It is actually common for people to develop habits like this when they’re struggling. Have you thought about finding healthier coping mechanisms or seeking support to address the root of what’s bothering you? It could be helpful to talk to someone who can listen without judgment and offer guidance on managing your emotions and finding healthier ways to cope.

Skip if you’re not interested )
I am working in the public service sector for almost 2 years.
My direct boss is a well-liked person to the senior management as he always portrays himself very well in front of them. However, whenever he speaks to my team, he is very discriminating and remarks on inappropriate topics.
For example, on one occasion where I shared with him that I am suffering form generalised anxiety disorder, and he seem empathetic, he listened to my stories and it felt like he understood what I am going through. However, he likes to speak about himself every time I mention something bad about me. At other times, where my team gather for meetings, he would comment things like “mental health is fake”, “depression is fake”, “people with mental health conditions cannot contribute to the society”.
He also verbally abuse interns openly. Once we were having a class with him with interns from ITE and NUS attending. He made this comment: “ITE students do not have the ability to process information well. That’s the difference between ITE and NUS students”. He also added that “that is why most ITE and poly students cannot go to university”.
It doesn’t stop at just abusing interns. I have heard from my other colleagues that he frequently shouts at contractors, calling them stupid and hurling vulgarities at them.
Other issues include:
- targeting people during meetings
- twisting his words/saying different things to different people
- sharing other’s private information
- no respect for personal time, expects you to work OT and don’t claim time off
- denying employee benefits
- favouritsm
- ignore messages and emails, no replies to my leave application. Asked him verbally and he said he will only reply if there is a problem. Silence means consent…
- gaslighting
- makes you feel guilty when taking MC
I have been trying to make a complaint about his actions to my HR, however, I have been advised by many of my colleagues not to do so. They warned me that in the past, when people does that, he made sure to make that person’s life more difficult. I have also tried to seek help by writing to the AWARE (association of women for action and research), however, they suggested that I gather more evidence and more than 2 persons before I go to the HR as it would seem more substantial. I do not want to affect my other colleagues or interns and ask them to go to HR with me as I am afraid it would affect their future.
Working here have been tough and sometimes intolerable. I have had suicidal thoughts wanting to end my life as working here is really tough and I wanted to end it quick. I am bonded the the company for another 2 years so I cannot afford to get targetted and bullied by my boss. If I am really targetted, I worry that my mental health will decline again. I am currently taking Zoloft 100mg every day and just starting to feel better.

I’ve been wanting to expose my bosses to HR and the senior management about their questionable behaviours at work…
My direct boss discriminates people (staff, interns, contractors), calling them stupid, saying things like “ITE students don’t have the ability to process information. That’s the difference between ITE and NUS students…that’s why people from ITE and poly cannot get into university”.
My colleagues warned me to not expose my boss to HR or senior management as there will be repercussions to my career. I am currently bonded to the company for another 2 years, and it would be better if I keep quiet than to voice things out.
Another reason why I cannot expose him is that he is well-liked by many people who is not from the team as he portrays himself as a nice and understanding person. He speaks very very well and can twist his words to make him sound very convincing.
I have tried to contact AWARE.sg, and their advice was to gather more people to make the complaint as going alone wouldn’t make the case strong enough for an investigation.
There are also acts of animal abuse/cruelty/neglect? He demanded for all 8 cats to not be fed as he wants them to catch rats and squirrels. There was an incident whereby one cat got run over by a buggy, and he refused to bring her to the vet to get it checked. The cat, although survived, is limping and is still peeing blood. There is no animal welfare in this place…and many of my colleagues and myself are afraid to go against him because of the unforeseen circumstances.
He’s also against mental health. When I told him I have generalised anxiety disorder, he was empathetic and listened to my troubles. However, during meetings, he says things like “mental health conditions are fake”, “people with mental health conditions don’t contribute to the society”, “doctors diagnose you with a condition because they just want to earn money”.
It’s very painful and uncomfortable to work in this environment, and I can’t help to feel depressed thinking that I am stuck here for another 2 years. I’m not sure if I’m able to do anything…

Firstly, your life is valuable. If you have thoughts about ending it, please seek help immediately by calling SOS at 1767.
On his verbal abuse, I think it’s hard to go up against him directly especially if he is good at managing up. Also based on what I’m reading, it seems like a lot of the unnecessary comments are directed to your interns and your contractors. Maybe can check with them on how they feel / encourage them to make a report if they feel like they have been bullied at the workplace. It might be better if it comes directly from them instead of you (as a bystander).
But honestly I don’t think any of this will change, especially if he has been working for a long time and has formed a certain style of working. The best way to do this maybe, is to ask for a transfer citing better exposure or growth opportunities for you. If your company is big enough, maybe got chance.
Are any of your colleagues in the same situation as you where they are also bonded for a few years?",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing so authentically about what’s been happening, I hear you and I’m so sorry to hear about the challenges you’re facing in your workplace. It sounds very distressing to experience discrimination, verbal abuse, and a lack of support from your boss. Your feelings of frustration and hopelessness are completely valid given the circumstances.
I just want to say that it’s commendable that you reached out for help and support. I can understandable that you feel hesitant to report your boss’s behavior, especially considering the potential repercussions you’ve seen others face. However, your mental health and safety should always come first.
I want to encourage you with these suggestions:
2. Please focus on your mental health Your well-being should always come first! It’s important to set boundaries to protect yourself from further harm. This might include setting limits on how much overtime you’re willing to work, seeking support from mental health professionals, and engaging in self-care activities that help you cope with stress.
3. Document everything Perhaps you can keep detailed records of any instances of discrimination, verbal abuse, or mistreatment you experience or witness. This documentation can serve as evidence if you decide to report the behavior to HR or seek support from external organizations. Include dates, times, and descriptions of what occurred, as well as any witnesses who can corroborate your account.
4. Explore your options for support Consider reaching out to your HR, even if you’re concerned about potential retaliation. HR departments have a responsibility to address workplace misconduct and ensure a safe working environment for all employees.
Please remember that your mental health matters, and if you ever feel overwhelmed or find yourself struggling with suicidal thoughts, it’s important to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support.
I would also like you to remember that these options are available for you, should you want to reach out to a mental health professional:

I understand from my colleagues that some of the contractors have filed a report to the management but their complaints were ignored and the bullying got worse. The contractors even went to the MP a few times, and wrote to the organisation’s CEO, but then again, it came back as the contractor being at fault that’s why my bosses treated them that way…
I know there are a few of us (newer staffs) who are struggling a lot in this workplace too. We all don’t really know what to do, and don’t understand how some of them can survive here for so long (some are here for 10 years).",,1,,12907,12907.0,,

Thank you so much for the reply. I have been collating evidences in the form of voice recordings and account of incidents. I hope these can be used as evidence whenever I feel I’m ready to voice things out. But I doubt it will be useful… I have heard of one incident whereby the boss made a racist remark towards an intern so she went to inform HR about it. There was almost nothing done to my boss about it (probably some verbal warning?) and he gets to continue his inappropriate behaviour as usual.

Hi @anonymous163
Thanks for letting us know how you’re doing. I hear you, it is indeed tough to witness inappropriate behavior at work and feel powerless to address it. While documenting incidents is smart, past experiences of little action may fuel doubts about its effectiveness. I can also understand that you feel fearful of repercussions, especially seeing others face challenges for speaking out.

Actually there are many people who have worked in the public sector for a long time. And these are people who probably know how to manage their interactions, know what to see and what not to see. Some say act blur live longer and I think that’s true for many people.
For the newer generation, I think we’re more used to being vocal and voicing out our concerns. We probably have a harder time reconciling certain behaviors with our moral values.

Thank you for sharing your struggles, I hear you, and I can sense the weight of what you’re going through. It sounds very tough to go through such pressure, especially when it feels like it’s coming from both external sources and from within yourself. Feeling like your efforts aren’t yielding the results you desire can be truly disheartening, and it’s completely understandable that it’s affecting your confidence.
I can also understand that this stress is spilling over into your personal life, affecting your relationship with your boyfriend. It’s tough to compartmentalize when you’re carrying so much on your shoulders.
I do have some questions to ask, if you have time, you could reflect on them and let us know more:
2. What specific aspects of your work environment or tasks are contributing most to the pressure you’re feeling?
3. How might shifting your focus from solely outcomes to recognizing your efforts and progress along the way help alleviate some of the pressure and boost your confidence?
You know, feeling incompetent and useless is a common reaction to such pressure (I experience this too!), but it doesn’t reflect your true worth.

I would also like to recommend trying some mindfulness exercises to help manage your stress levels. Deep breathing, meditation, or even taking short breaks throughout the day can make a big difference. Maybe you can also try to communicate with your boyfriend about how you’re feeling and the challenges you’re facing. Building a support system can help you feel less alone in dealing with these difficulties

There isn’t one specific aspect of work that caused me stress. Rather it’s perhaps overthinking most of the time and having alot of self-doubt. For example, if i have to make a decision at work, I tend to spend a lot of time self-rationalising in my head then i made the right decision.

I can hear that you’re dealing with a heavy load of stress and self-doubt, which can definitely take a toll on your well-being. Here are three suggestions that might help you go through this challenging time:
2. Practice mindfulness and grounding techniques When you catch yourself overthinking or spiraling into self-doubt, try grounding yourself in the present moment. Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or simply focusing on your senses (like noticing the sensation of your breath or the feeling of your feet on the ground) can help bring you back to the present and calm your mind.
3. Set boundaries and focus on your self-care! It’s important to carve out time for yourself and set healthy boundaries between work and personal life. You could schedule regular breaks during the day to recharge, engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation outside of work, and make sure you’re getting enough restful sleep. Please take care of yourself!
4. Try to seek support and professional help! Don’t hesitate to reach out to trusted friends, family members, or colleagues for support. Sometimes, just talking about your feelings with someone who listens non-judgmentally can provide relief Therapy can be a safe space to explore and address the underlying causes of your stress and self-doubt, and to develop healthier ways of thinking and coping

I have had thoughts of incompetence creeping up to me from time to time and one time it got really overwhelming till the point where everything felt so negative.

Like what @cottonsoul mentioned peacefulness and grounding techniques did help me Just acknowledging that the thought is there and like breathing in and out, counting objects helped me recalibrate my emotions when I am over thinking

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with anxiety and your home condition. It must be really suffocating and anxiety-inducing if this reduces the possibility of personal space. I just want to let you know that what you’re feeling and thinking given your circumstances is valid. I’m also curious to know what do you do to cope with your anxiety?
I wonder if you’ve spoken to your family members about the situation at home? I wonder if there’s an uncertainty regarding the number of people going to change/reduce? An open discussion about this, perhaps with a family member that you trust and can offer helpful suggestion, might be worth having. This could be done in a setting where no one is in a rush and preferably with minimal distractions, using I-statements: When (describe what happened re: living arrangements), I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like to see happen e.g., get a win-win scenario of a feasible long-term living arrangement) so that we can (support and enable everyone to get some personal space).
I’m also heartened to hear you looking out for yourself (your consideration of external accomodation) and taking charge of your mental well-being. You mentioned a diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder; I wonder about the support you’re receiving to manage your worries and beliefs about the things you worry (e.g., dealing with distraction/avoidance behaviour, evaluating the severity of the threat, etc.)? - as it helps when you’re supported by people who understand your diagnosis, and receiving psychotherapy and medication, if required, to work through and process your distress.
Looking to hear back from you. Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need. Until then, take care!",,1,,,,,

Thank you for taking the courage to share with us your struggles, I hear you, and I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult time. I can hhear that it feels overwhelming to witness your parents arguing, especially when it’s affecting you so deeply, both emotionally and physically. It’s understandable that this situation would exacerbate the struggles you’re already facing with depression, psychosis, and PTSD.
I would like you to try these suggestions if possible:
2. Create a Safe Space for Yourself. Please do try to create a safe space for yourself where you can retreat when your parents argue. This space could be a quiet corner in your room, a park, or any place where you feel calm and at ease. Fill this space with comforting items such as books, music, or photos that bring you joy, so that taking breaks in this safe space can provide you with a sense of refuge during tense moments at home.
3. Practice Self-Care! Self care helps us to manage the stress and emotional toll of most situations. You can try to engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, or gentle yoga. Additionally, do ensure you’re getting enough rest, eating nourishing meals, and staying hydrated! Taking care of your physical and emotional needs can strengthen your resilience and ability to cope with challenging situations like this.
4. Talk to a mental health professional for support - I highly encourage you to speak to a mental health professional to get continuous support for yourself, especially if it gets too overwhelming. If you don’t have a social worker or a professional linked to yourself already, you can try walking in to a nearby Family service centre or speak to any online mental health professional such as:

Eventhough I have gotten used to the shouting it still affects me from time to time and i have ill feeling hoping that the old man that shouts croaks and dies.
I know other neighbours have complain to Town council before but to no avail. The thing is cant call the police cause the shouting is burst of 5- 10 mins at a time then complete silence for hours. But its at 4-5am in the morning, From anywhere around 10 am to 2 pm then again at 12 mn to 2am somedays.
The thing is we felt in debt cause they did give us stuff like washing machine, fans and vegetables ( On a monthly basis )
I know that the old man have kidney problems but i suspect that he has some mental issues as well such as ED ( explosive disorder ) cause it doesnt matter what time of day it is if he feels like bursting out.
The thing is his wife recently passed and his son has a learning disability. He often argues with his son over the pmd that he has or other things like that.
I did inform them that i have a mental condition.
I just fear that the day comes when i have no control over myself and take drastic action. FYI about a decade ago i started to hear voices and i chased a man with full body tatoos around Redhill cause the voices told me that he was a bad guy. It was ghost festival time.

Accepting help like a washing machine, fans, and vegetables can certainly make it feel complicated to address the noise issue. It’s clear you’re trying to balance gratitude with the need for peace in your own home.
Hearing about the old man’s situation, with his health issues and the loss of his wife, adds another layer of complexity. It’s compassionate of you to consider his circumstances, even when his behavior is affecting you so negatively. It sounds like he’s going through a lot, but that doesn’t make your own feelings any less valid.
The fear of losing control over your actions is a serious concern, especially given your past experiences. It’s crucial to acknowledge these feelings and consider seeking support to help manage them. I remember you’ve been singing and writing songs, has that helped in releasing some of this pent-up energy?
On the noise issue, it seems like it’s very hard to get your neighbor to change. Have you considered wearing ear plugs to sleep so that it reduces the noise and impact?",,1,,,,,

Thanks for sharing about your struggles here regarding your neighbour - it sounds really awful about what’s going on and how you’re trying to delicately handle this. It also sounds like you’ve caught in a dilemma of honouring this neighbour for the rendered assistance and wanting to honour your own and family’s boundaries, which is fair given the situation.
Whatever the reason behind your neighbour’s actions, it does appear to also affect other neighbours. This could be a possibility for collective action, where perhaps y’all can plan to divide actions that can target to assist the neighbour to reduce the likelihood of making the noises - maybe this could look like assisting the neighbour’s son, maybe it could look like assisting the neighbour on his health concern (e.g., kidney problems). Hopefully this could (in)directly address some of the neighbour’s needs.
I want to address your question on whether it’s normal to bottle up feelings of hate; perhaps a better question would be “what to do with bottled up emotions that has nowhere to go?”. And this is where I want to commend you on managing your mental health condition and the things you do for yourself to cope (e.g., singing, writing songs, etc.) - up to the point where it becomes overwhelming and unbearable; and probably doing things or wishing for it to no longer be there (like with the noisy neighbour)… Perhaps you’re already doing these so this could be a reminder to manage your safety or from doing anything unhelpful. It could be helpful if you can get assistance from a trusted person when it gets too overwhelming for you. Let them know about the thoughts you’re having and that you just wanna be safe (e.g., keeping your surroundings safe, put away dangerous items like knifes/medications in locked cabinets, look for you immediately if you’re in distress, etc.). This plan helps them know what they can do exactly at that moment to support you.
Do share with us what you think about this? And I hope to hear more from you about it. Until then, take care!",,2,,,,,
8701,i’m not too sure what to do from here?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/im-not-too-sure-what-to-do-from-here/8701,Seeking Help,"needadvice, emotions",5810,plvto,User,,12892,1,"recently i fell out with a group of my cca friends, it may not sound like a big deal but it is to me because of the nature of the fallout and the fact that i’m not great at making friends so losing one of the few people that actually took the time to get to know me despite me being really introverted kind of hurt a lot so idk…
last year during the december holidays they kept trying to plan outings but i was sick for the first half and then my mental health took a turn for the worst towards the last part of it so i kept declining. Then my mental health didn’t get better when school started and i just genuinely didn’t have the energy to talk to them or anyone at all without getting irritated so i started isolating myself just in case i would snap at someone i really cared about and that didn’t deserve it. It carried over until now and recently i had a talk with one of them about it. I bought them snacks to show that I cared because at the same time, one of my close friends in the group was dealing with something really heavy so while getting something for her i got something for them as well. I had written a card saying that even though i’m not great at communicating, expressing myself or engaging in social stuff like outings, i still really really care for them and love them. One of them texted to thank me and asked what i meant about the social part of the card because the whole group doesn’t know what’s going on with me. I explained and apologised for the lack of communication about why i took time away from them and then we kind of went into her calling me out for my problematic behaviour and me basically explaining as well as apologising for my toxicity.
She basically said that it felt as if I was using the friend group to vent about boys and that they were there for me when I needed them but it felt as if I treated the guys better than I treated them because I gave the guys things here and there while I only gave them stuff once in a while. Then there was the issue of me not talking to them but talking to certain guys in my cca, which I explained was because they started talking to me first and me sitting with them just meant me listening to their rants on gambling or sports so I didn’t need to talk, hence it didn’t take much out of me socially. After which came the heavy stuff I guess? It was just talking about my trauma with previous friend groups that treated me bad and caused me to close up and have major trust issues and a lot of my emotional anxiety and avoidance when it came to people I loved. For context, I have borderline personality disorder so it’s very hard for me to not swing from either attachment style very wildly. I try my best not to but it’s very difficult to get over certain trauma and the thoughts in my head saying nasty stuff to me in my friends’ voices.
I apologised as sincerely as I could and said I would change and do better, which I’m genuinely committed to doing but I’m so unsure as to how. I made them bracelets for their taylor swift concert with cards explaining why i chose those songs for them respectively, i got them snacks and i’m currently planning to bake stuff for my friends (them included) and i really want to give them some too. i’m not used to talking or connecting verbally because no one in my life has ever done that to me, ever since i was a kid i’ve learnt from my family and other friends that the way to apologise is to give people things so that’s just become the way i show i care and that i love them. I’ve tried to incorporated writing letters or cards too to try and express myself, because every time i talk i just get misunderstood or i can’t articulate my thoughts in a cohesive manner.
so i texted in the group chat to ask if anyone was lactose intolerant so i could make the switch to oat milk if needed to but i got left on read. when we talked it seemed as if everything was okay and two of my friends were quite nice about it, but in person they still seem very cold and i don’t know if i’m just imagining it or if they just genuinely want to stop associating with me… but they said that they would like to get to know me better when i feel okay again?? i don’t know… three of them are also in a solid trio so it’s very hard to talk to the group without feeling as if i’m intruding or feeling left out, my closest friend in the group also kind of left (like she’s still in the group but can’t hang as often because she stayed back a year) and it feels so awkward without her. i don’t know what to do to sincerely show i care for them and to show that i’m sorry.",,1,,,,,
8701,i’m not too sure what to do from here?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/im-not-too-sure-what-to-do-from-here/8701,Seeking Help,"needadvice, emotions",59,Jaws,User,,12908,2,"Hey @plvto
It sounds like you’ve been through quite the rollercoaster with your friends, and it’s totally understandable that you’re feeling the way you do. The situation with the group outings, your health, and the whole dynamic shifting—it’s a lot for anyone to handle.
You mentioned that you’ve tried to reach out by giving snacks and writing heartfelt cards, which is a really thoughtful way to show you care. It’s clear that you put a lot of thought into your gestures, like making bracelets for the Taylor Swift concert. That’s pretty special and shows how much you value your friendships.
It sounds like there’s a bit of a disconnect in how you and your friends are interpreting these gestures and communications. Have you had the chance to ask your friends how they felt about the cards and the snacks? Sometimes what we intend and how it’s received can be different, and it might provide some insight into their reactions.
The group chat situation sounds frustrating, especially being left on read after asking about the oat milk. It’s a small thing, but it shows you’re considering their needs, which is a kind gesture. Have you noticed any changes in the group dynamics since then, or have there been any more interactions that might give you clues about how they’re feeling?
Navigating friendships when you feel like an outsider, especially with the trio within the group and your closest friend not being around as much, is tough. It’s okay to feel awkward; many would feel the same in your shoes.
You’re doing a lot to show you care and mend the friendships, which is commendable. Remember, it’s also important to look after your own well-being. Balancing your needs with the effort to reconnect with your friends is key.",,0,,12892,,12892.0,

Thanks for coming on here and sharing about your struggles with friendships and with how you’re trying your best to maintain them. It must feel really tiring and overwhelming but I commend you on not giving in - and what you’re thinking and feeling about your situation is valid given what you’ve been through along with your circumstances
I can see how important your friends are and I suppose it’s due to you valuing connection with people; your values can help you live a life that is true to who you ARE and want to BE. At the same time, I see you taking the extra mile in your kindness towards everyone (another value of yours) and acts of service towards your group of friends - I also hear you when you say that an apology comes in the form of presenting gifts, I see you taking responsibility for your actions.
You also mentioned about attachment and the instability of your bonds with others, associated with your borderline personality disorder. I wonder if you’ve been receiving support regarding this diagnosis to help you manage your mood and how you perceive yourself? Those with borderline personality disorder find that it helps when they are supported by people who understand their diagnosis, and with psychotherapy being effective in working through and processing their trauma.
I also want to commend you on your self-awareness regarding your mental health. You’re able to notice the changes in your mood and behaviour with your thoughts. I wonder what you’ve done in the past that helped you manage overwhelming feelings? And hopefully in a way that is kind to yourself. Given what you’ve been through, it is really stressful and anxiety-provoking especially with the fear of losing people or being left by others. But I’m heartened that you find ways to cope when you say that you find it better to express yourself through letters and cards - I wonder if this sort of ‘distancing’ (taking time to write your words down) gives you another perspective of the situation
In the meantime, perhaps some of this can help you cope with your distress, if you haven’t been doing them already:
- Regular exercise
- Get healthy and regular meals
- Get hydrated
- Prioritise restful sleep
- Engage in a relaxing activity
- Set goals/priorities
- Practice gratitude
Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need. Hope to hear from you.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with work (it does not sound easy at all) and how you’re finding it really hard to cope. It also sounds like you’re finding the situation pretty bleak (things don’t look like they’re gonna get better if nothing changes) given how tired and overwhelmed you feel - I wanna let you know that your feelings are valid given your circumstances.
It sounds like you’re pouring from an empty cup (dealing with angry employees, having to take care of the household when you return home, etc.) - you can’t give anymore until you go back to taking care of yourself. You need a breather - catching your breath and continuing to remain above water by taking deep breaths when the going gets tougher (as this helps to calm down your brain’s fight-or-flight response) in the short-term. Also, supporting your physical health is also equally important as working on your mental health - do ensure you’re getting regular exercise, healthy meals, staying hydrated, restful sleep, relaxing activity, practice gratitude and staying connected with others.
I also wonder if you’ve experienced something like this before and what helped you cope better in the past? I also hear how demoralising this must feel and that it’s also affecting your relationship. It will be helpful if you can express this feelings and concerns with someone who can listen and support you - I wonder if you had the chance to share this with your husband? However, if you’re open to seeking professional support to develop better coping skills to regulate your mood and work on your situation, you can consider reaching out to Family Service Centres.
It will also be tough to put work and life on pause so I wonder if you can consider delegating some of the work in office and at home? Here’s where open communication and using I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like done instead) can help you get your concerns across and in a manner that others (i.e., your boss and your husband) can listen in a non-judgmental way and understand clearly, before negotiating for a win-win scenario. This will not be a one-off discussion but it will definitely help in the long run.
I can see why you’re feeling on your own in handling this and I hope you can try to work something out to get some help. And once you’re a bit more able to deal with the stress and anxious feelings, you can bounce back stronger and tackle the work - hopefully by being kinder on yourself and coping before it becomes too overwhelming for you again. Hope to hear from you; you deserve and can get the necessary support you need, take care!",breaths https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=breathe_deeply; Centres https://www.msf.gov.sg/our-services/directories,2,,,,,

Thanks for coming on here and sharing about your struggles with being overwhelmed and how it’s affecting your life - how your feeling right now is valid given your circumstances and what you’re going through.
It will be helpful if you’re able to take a step back and catch your breath, as it’s extremely difficult to see the the bigger picture and to figure out what to do when you’re caught in the throes of things. I hear you when you say you’re overwhelmed with studies, relationships, and work - it must be tiring and hopeless to the point where you’re unsure of everything and you’d wish all of this is over - so taking a pause gives you some space first.
A lot of things seem to be happening and feels like it’s out of your hands or not within your control - what can you do in the meantime to gain control over some of these things? Before that, the focus should be on yourself first - can you be more gentle to yourself at the moment. Give yourself what you need; postpone or seek assistance if you need to make any important decisions, and discuss how you’re feeling with your partner, family and friends to let them know what you’re going through and need at the moment. Also, have you been taking care of yourself? If not, do consider:
- Getting regular exercise
- Geting healthy and regular meals
- Staying hydrated
- Prioritising restful sleep
- Engaging in a relaxing activity
- Being kind to yourself
- Checking if your thoughts are accurate & helpful
You mentioned your emotions trying to take over and that you’re finding it difficult to comply with medication (I’m curious to know what the medication is supposed to be helping you with?) - I wonder what have you done before that helped you to cope? I also want to commend you for having the self-awareness to seek help (e.g., seeing a Psychiatrist) and coming on here to ventilate and hopefully regulate your mood a little bit better. The thing with emotions is that there’s probably a message behind it that’s trying to let you know if something is unmet and if you’re able to notice what that could be, perhaps that can shed light on what actions you can take to meet those needs. Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need.

I’m really grateful that you reached out to share what you’ve been going through. I’m so sorry to hear that you’ve been carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I want you to know that your feelings and experiences are valid.
It’s not uncommon for the demands of school, especially during challenging times, to take a toll on your mental and emotional well-being. Feeling sad, losing interest in hobbies, experiencing mood swings, and having frequent negative thoughts are all signs that something may be affecting your mental health.
I commend you for your willingness to talk about these thoughts and feelings here on this platform – This is a positive step towards understanding and addressing the issues, and I’m proud of you for this!
Sometimes, the stress of upcoming exams and external pressures (like from your mother’s expectations) can be difficult to balance altogether, but I affirm you for seeking help and support when you’re struggling to balance it all.
Considering the frequency of negative thoughts about suicide, even if you don’t want to act on them, it’s crucial to take them seriously. It’s a positive sign that you’re open to the idea of seeking professional help by considering seeing a doctor. They can provide you with a proper evaluation and guidance on how to manage your mental health. I would also encourage you to speak to a mental health professional (whether it’s a school counsellor or someone outside of school), to find support and get specific interventions to help support you through this season.
If you ever feel like you have a difficult time and need urgent help, please do call these numbers:
- SOS: 1-767
- SOS whatsapp: Share on WhatsApp
- IMH - 63892222
In the meantime, I encourage you to try out these activities and resources to help you to manage your feelings – these can be pretty helpful when things get overwhelming!

In the meantime, I encourage you to keep talking to someone you trust about your feelings, whether it’s a friend, family member, or a mental health professional. Sharing your thoughts and emotions can be a powerful way to relieve some of the emotional burden you’re carrying.
Again, I just want to help you to remember that you don’t have to go through this alone, and there is support available to help you navigate these difficult times.

For this past few months and almost half of 2023 last year was the worst thing I ever have to experience.
Firstly, I did not get the school poly I wanted which I already apply last year EAE (Early Admission Exercise) but wasn’t been chosen. From there I felt I was depress and didn’t ate dinner with my family which I always do. Moreover, what makes me even sad is that my close friends got accept so I felt awkward or left out again
Secondly, my internship has been driving me crazy especially the first month. They ask me to do something that I feel uncomfortable which was socializing many people everyday and that makes me feel pain like my chest was squeezing me so hard that I cant breath. Moreover, my interns looks like they hate me and the staff felt like I’m weak like I cant do better then the others which makes me upset so bad that I really want to help and try my very best… But almost some days I keep crying and angry that I scold my friends which I do not know why I did that which was silly and I know its wrong but I don’t know why I feel this way, it can be that they have a happy intern or finish early that I’m still here internship till mid Mar and working on a Saturday every weekend from their event.
Thirdly, during my internship… I lost my live-in grandmother and I was so devastated. I’ve never felt so broken in my life. I still feel guilty that I didn’t do what she want me to do in life which the most important one was want me to be happy… I really want to do it but sometimes I cant find any happiness along the way and always scared of my new path.
Moreover, I don’t know what’s gonna happen after my internship and hopefully I don’t know get to my poly I wanted.",,2,,,,,

I experienced something similar to you regarding friends when I was in poly where although my friends were in the same school they both got grouped into the same class except for me. Our schedules all became very different and I felt left out and awkward again. It’s difficult seeing your close friends get closer to each other while drifting away from you
But I guess thats life I still feel abit of sadness when I think about it but I’ve learnt to accept it and focus on expanding my relationships with other people and myself. Going for activities alone and meeting new people or reconnect with people whom I have lost contact with.
I personally had experience with a job which I was not comfortable with too I had to push for sales for products which I don’t think was benifical and I felt like I was pressured just to pump the numbers up I ended up leaving after 4 months after experiencing breathlessness from thinking about the job So I think what you are feeling is totally valid like its a natural reaction when we do things that are against our core beliefs and character. I think it will be good to also speak to your supervisor or school internship office regarding this too perhaps they can give you advice on how you should proceede as well

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us, I hear you and I commend you for writing to us here. I want to acknowledge your courage in reaching out and sharing what’s been weighing on your heart. It takes a lot to open up, especially when you’re feeling vulnerable and unsure. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it’s completely understandable to be scared of potential hurt or judgment.
It sounds like you’ve been through a really tough time lately, with multiple challenges hitting you all at once. Not getting into the school poly you wanted must have been a huge disappointment, especially when it seemed like everyone around you was moving forward. I can also imagine that feeling left out or disconnected from your friends can amplify those feelings of loneliness and sadness.
Your internship experience sounds very overwhelming, and I guess it must have been a source of stress for you. I know how it feels when we’re not meeting expectations or being judged by others, it can really take a toll on your self-esteem and overall happiness.
Also, losing your grandmother must have been devastating, and I’m truly sorry for your loss. Grief is a complex and painful journey, and it’s natural to feel guilty or overwhelmed by the weight of your emotions. Your grandmother’s wish for your happiness is a beautiful reminder of her love and support for you, but please know that it’s still normal to struggle with finding happiness amidst such difficult circumstances.
As for the uncertainty about what comes next after your internship, it’s completely normal to feel anxious about the future, especially when it feels like things haven’t been going as planned. It’s okay to not have all the answers right now
I want to encourage you to continue sharing and talking about your struggles, because we are here to support you. There are also mental health professionals that you can speak to, and here are some options:

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with your mood and figuring out what to do. I wanna commend you on your self-awareness and let you know that what you’re thinking and feeling is valid, given what you’re going through. It must be tremendously difficult to feel adrift to the point of considering an escape route where you no longer need to confront the distress or pain…
I know that this is tough and it would be helpful to get assistance from at least a trusted person when it gets too overwhelming for you. Let the person know about the thoughts you’re having and that you just wanna be safe (e.g., keeping your surroundings safe, put away dangerous items like knifes/medications in locked cabinets, look for you immediately if you’re in distress, etc.). This plan helps the person know what they can do exactly at that moment to support you.
You mentioned feeling unmotivated and stressed since this year - wondering if this had happened to you before? And if so, what had you done before to help you cope? Also, you mentioned seeking reassurance - what is it that can help reduce your worries, and how would that look like if you can take actions to do so? I wonder if the transitions in life you’re experiencing (friendships, school) reflect the importance you place on the values of connection with people, and the changes to what was familiar and constant has thrown you off… Perhaps here is where you can look again at your values , note them down and give them some thought. I find that values can be a guide to help us live a life that is true to who we ARE and want to BE.
In the meantime, have you also been taking care of yourself? Please consider, if possible, getting some regular exercise, getting healthy and regular meals, getting hydrated, prioritising restful sleep, and engaging in a relaxing activity. Regarding motivation - it will be great if you can strike a balance between intrinsic (doing things for enjoyment, I’m guessing this is drawing for you) and extrinsic (external rewards like doing well in school to get good grades) motivation; especially when one isn’t working as well for you.
If you feel like you need to speak to someone immediately or things are just highly distressing, you can reach out to Samaritans of Singapore (1-767), IMH’s 24 hour helpline (6389 2222), or SOS’s 24 hour CareText: 9151 1767 (via WhatsApp).

Thank you for coming on and finding the courage to share what you’re going through. You’re finding it hard to manage your emotions at the moment, and I want to share that what you’re thinking and feeling about the situation is valid given your circumstances.
I wonder if something changed for you recently? Have you found yourself experiencing this before - where you can’t seem to express your emotions fully? If yes, what else have you done in the past that helped?
It feels jarring when your bouts of feeling emotional seem to appear uninvited… when we’re too distressed, our body finds it too overwhelmed to cope. I wonder if that’s what you’re experiencing? Like a dam that can’t contain overflowing waters, already breaking and where will the water go? And just before you feel that way, do you notice amy thoughts in your mind about how you view the situation or what you’re saying to yourself?
I’m glad to hear you trying to make yourself feel better using music. I wonder if there’s other ways to express your feelings when you feel emotional - perhaps writing it down, using creative means like drawing/colouring, moving your body through exercise/dance, screaming into a pillow, or seeking support from a person you trust and willing to listen nonjudgmentally (someone like a school counsellor or a close family member/friend?).
Hopefully this helps you to regulate your emotions better as you try to let it out in a helpful manner that doesn’t harm you, while you try to see if there’s any patterns or beliefs (how you view yourself, how you think about others, etc.) that seem to underpin these emotional reactions (before working through it). In the meantime, if you’re up for it, these practices might help with managing the distress:
- Being mindful
- Being kind to yourself
- Shifting (to a more helpful) perspective
Remember that deserve and can get the necessary support you need.

I’m really glad you reached out here, and I want you to know that you’re not alone in feeling this way. I hear you, and it sounds like you’re going through a lot right now, and it’s really brave of you to share your struggles. I understand that you’ve developed these coping mechanisms to try to get attention and care from others, especially if you’ve been feeling lonely and invisible.
Feeling the need to lie or say extreme things to get people’s attention can be a sign of deeper emotional pain or unresolved issues. I would like you to know that there are healthier ways to seek connection from others, and even though addiction to p*rnography and social media is a difficult pattern to break, you can do it with the right support!
I have 2 little suggestions that you might want to try to help you break the habit of lying:
2. Practice Honesty! You can start by making a conscious effort to be honest in your interactions, even if it feels uncomfortable or scary at first. Practice telling the truth, even about small things, and notice how it feels to be genuine.
3. Challenge Your Negative Thoughts! Try to explore any underlying beliefs or fears that may be driving your lying behavior (you can do this with a therapist too!).
I’m also sorry to hear that your experience with the school counselor didn’t meet your needs, and I understand how that might have made it harder for you to trust seeking help again. However, there are other professionals out there who are dedicated to supporting you, and I want to encourage you to consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor again.

For context, I’ve been experiencing really bad anxiety for the past 2-3 months. It all started when I had a multitude of gastric issues which severely disrupted my sleep (for about a month) and I got really anxious (to the point I was getting anxiety attacks) because I simply couldn’t sleep and was stressing over my performance at school. After that incident, I convinced myself that I had diabetes (yes, I do have health anxiety) due to having certain symptoms. Went to the doctor and everything was fine, but that didn’t end here. Soon after, I noticed that my (TMI warning) periods were becoming irregular and weird. So being the anxious person that I am, I Googled the symptoms and found really distressing results so now I’m really worried (I’m also prone to compulsively Googling symptoms & then self-diagnosing myself).

Thanks for sharing about your worries, sorry to hear about what you have been going through. It sounds like you have been dealing with all this for a while now and I imagine it would feel incredibly stressful and draining to be caught up in what feels like a cycle of new worries that keep popping up Im also hearing that you are stressing about your performance at school and experiencing anxiety attacks, altogether it does sound like a lot to handle and I can imagine how exhausting that must feel.
Health is an important part of our lives and its totally understandable that you would be worried about your health, especially after experiencing gastric issues, sleep disruptions, and irregular periods. It does sound troubling to think about constantly… How have you been coping? What has helped you calm down when you are anxious? (eg. Watching a favourite show/ movie, going on walks, talking with a friend, hobbies etc.) https://www.mindline.sg/youth/home also has some deep breathing and mindfulness resources that you can check out when you are feeling overwhelmed by anxiety
In a digital age, its almost intuitive to us to Google whatever questions that come to mind and I guess unfortunately health anxiety is no exception… Just want to reassure you that even though it may not feel like it at times, Googling symptoms and self-diagnosing is quite common/normal! I’ve also caught myself consulting Google and self-diagnosing too ahaha but seeking out a relevant healthcare professional is probably the wiser and more reliable option. You are definitely not alone in this and Im here for you if you ever need a listening ear
It can certainly be challenging to break away from these overwhelming thoughts and be tempted to take them as facts. That being said, your concerns are very valid and its okie to feel this way Wondering whether you’ve had a chance to speak to a healthcare professional about the irregular periods since?

I’ve been really stressed at school (I’m in Year 2 of poly) as I have more content-based modules to study for, which means more assignments and exams. I’ve also found the content to be harder to understand as well…I don’t really experience any anxiety attacks that much as compared to last time, but I’ve had instances in which I feel like they are coming up and it makes me scared as I never like having anxiety attacks :(.
My sleep disruptions have been mostly fixed (I think? With the help of my school counsellor & online resources) though I do find myself waking up in the middle of the night and then not been able to fall asleep from time to time. Doctors weren’t able to find out the cause of my gastric issues but usually medicine can treat it. I do find it distressing as the pain can get so bad at times where I’ve fainted on some occasions because of it. Usually when I feel anxious, I’ve tried doing things I enjoy such as playing games & watching YouTube. Now, I’m trying to incorporate exercises as well. I don’t have a lot of friends either so it’s hard to find someone to confide in & when I do confide in a friend, she usually just gives short answers and doesn’t seem sympathetic at all :(.
Yeah, I’ve tried to seek healthcare professionals to give me peace of mind but sometimes I don’t want to because I feel like it’s a waste of money if doctors don’t find anything wrong with me. Plus, I already don’t know how many times I’ve asked my parents to bring me to the doctor & I feel guilty for doing so. I just don’t know how to manage my health anxiety…
Today, I’ve just spoken to a doctor and they’ve ran some tests on me, but couldn’t find anything wrong. So, I’m already getting an appointment to a specialist and I’ll be seeing them sometime in July. I’ll be sure to keep you guys updated & thanks again for hearing me out!",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your current experiences and concerns, I think that you’re really brave and courageous for being so open and authentic about your feelings. It’s clear that you’re going through a challenging time, and I appreciate your effort in discussing your health and emotional well-being.
Indeed, the increased academic demands in Year 2 of poly can be quite overwhelming, and it’s completely normal for students to experience stress and anxiety as a result. It’s a good sign that you’ve noticed improvements in managing your anxiety compared to the past, but it’s understandable that the fear of anxiety attacks still lingers. Anxiety can be distressing, and the fear of it can sometimes exacerbate the symptoms.

I really appreciate the fact that you have provided me resources that can help with anxiety and will definitely try them out whenever I feel it coming on. I’ve tried joining an interest group in poly but I’m also socially anxious so I’m afraid of attending any activities hosted . So technically my only outlet for ranting is to either talk it out to my counsellor or just posting here. I recently also went for a follow-up appointment and the doctor said everything was fine and it could be because that I’m still young and stressed during that moment in time. I really appreciate you checking up on me !,,2,,,,,

Time to time I still cry. Sometimes a very deep sense of loneliness suddenly makes me not me. Like a part of me is saying to put my leg out of the window or play at the window. When this happens I feel like there are two of me.
I also lost focus at work, i am no longer who i was. Most of the times before getting out of bed to prepare for work, either i cry or will have mild anxiety.
To me everyday is survivor game. Everyday is a challenge, a battle i need to fight and win to live.
My co-workers don’t see what’s inside me, bec each time i face other people I always give a normal me.
I don’t know what to do anymore. I didn’t have time to feel my loss. When dad got sick and was diagnosed of last stage cancer, i had to juggle work and flying to see him each time he’ll be admitted in the hospital while i was adjusting with my new job. All the way until i lost him.
After settling his burial, i needed to come back to work. Trying to pull myself together. Adjusting my new job (new role, new environment) while adjusting on my recent loss.
I sometimes loss my sanity.

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles on this platform, it takes so much courage to be vulnerable and I commend you for that. We are here to journey with you.
I’m truly so sorry to hear about the profound loss of your dad and the overwhelming challenges you’re facing. It’s completely understandable that you’re still grieving and experiencing a range of emotions. Losing a loved one is an incredibly difficult and personal journey, and it’s clear that you’ve been carrying a heavy load while trying to manage work and life changes.
I want to encourage you to recognize that grieving is a process, and there’s no right or wrong way to go through it. Your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to allow yourself the time and space to mourn. It sounds like you’ve been incredibly strong and resilient in handling multiple responsibilities, but it’s also important to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being.
I hear your struggles, and I would really encourage you to reach out to a professional therapist or counselor who can provide a safe and supportive space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. They can offer guidance on how to cope, help you work through the grieving process, and provide strategies to manage the challenges you’re facing at work.
I would really recommend starting with a counsellor or therapist from either a nearby Family Service Centre, or approach any online counsellors here:
- Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
- ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
You can also check out these counselling providers who specifically support clients on grief and bereavement processing: Find counselling services - My Legacy
Additionally, perhaps communicating with your supervisor or HR department about the emotional difficulties you’re experiencing may be helpful. They may be able to offer support, such as adjusting your workload temporarily or providing resources for grief counseling.
Also, I would like to share a few tools that can help temporarily to relief the emotional pain for a short while. But please remember that it would be best for you to let a therapist journey with you throughout this grieving process, as you need the emotional support.
Some helpful tools:
2. Guided meditation - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Relaxation practices - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
4. Take deep breaths and remain calm - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Remember that it’s okay to ask for help, and taking care of your mental health is a priority. Please do surround yourself with understanding friends and family who can offer support, and consider joining a grief support group where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.
I would also like you to look through this link and read more about coping with grief: How to Manage Grief and Loss | Agency for Integrated Care
Please take small steps each day and be gentle with yourself during this challenging time. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need someone to talk to, don’t hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional or a trusted friend. Your well-being matters, and there are people who care and want to support you.

I will read this over and over again, as it made me feel good. I will definitely seek professional help. I just so clueless of what is happening to me. Today I am okay, the next day I am not. Each time my heart feels light and happy without a reason at all, I suddenly get scared. It makes me wonder, maybe this joyfulness I feel may turn to frustration later. I ask if is it a signal that later or at the end of the day something bad will happen.

I wish I had as much courage as you to share all this when I lost my father. I believe things would be different for me if I did. I was 9 when he passed on. Despite just those short number of years, I still remember what he and I did together. In a sense we never forget our loss and we shouldn’t need to.
I have attended a session of ‘Grief Cafe’ where participants are given a safe space to talk about the loss of a loved one. It is held once a month at Assisi Hospice. It is hosted by a Grief and Bereavement Care Counsellor. Although I left the group because of scheduling, the single session was comforting as everyone in the group shared a commonality.

The way people treat you, family,friends and even general public changes. All manners of body shaming. There was a few times in public , scrawny people would rub their belly and look at me. But they won’t do that to a morbidly obese person cause all they have to do is sit on them Lol.
How you treat people show a lot about your character and Upbringing. People who poke fun and make a person feel less are often then not very insecure people.
I have had the pleasure to know my former Boss from Brazil that had it all - The 5’Cs however he treats everyone with dignity. He used to drive a Maserati and before he went back he drove a Ferrari. Lives in a Condo, Good looking and had a great Career with an Oil Company. So i guess it’s only fitting that he actually married a model. Unlike some people I got to know that looks like a toilet that is only halfway constructed ( In Malay,Muka jamban tak siap ) and have the audacity to feel that they have it all and treat people like Crap- both men and woman.
The girls. ladies or woman that i got to know over the years have many high expectations for their partner. I mean if i was in the position where I had it all, why would i even choose you ? Wouldn’t A Person with 5’C goes for something better ? What do you have to offer in return ? Etc.
The Lesson Here is that we should manage our expectations. Treat everyone with dignity no matter if they are the CEO or Janitor. Be it Fit, Scrawny , Meaty, Fluffy. Morbidly Obese etc we all deserve the basic respect as human being. We are all unique in our own ways and like this song im going to share…

Don’t you like you?
Cause I like you""…

Thank you for sharing with us your thoughts and the song! I hear you, and it sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and I can understand how the changes in your body, coupled with the reactions from others, can deeply affect you. It’s unfortunate that people sometimes fail to see beyond appearances and treat others with the respect and kindness they deserve.
I agree with your insight into the nature of people’s behavior, I find that it is quite profound! Indeed, those who resort to belittling others often do so out of their own insecurities. And it’s truly heartening to hear about people like your former boss who embody dignity and respect in their interactions, regardless of their status or appearance He deserves a thumbs-up!
Also, I know that relationships can be difficult to manage and sometimes confusing, especially when faced with societal expectations and perceptions of worth. But you’re absolutely right that everyone, regardless of their external traits, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect We all have unique qualities and contributions to offer, and it’s important for us to recognize and appreciate each other’s humanity.
I too have songs to encourage you, they may be old ones but they’re goldies!
2. “Scars to Your Beautiful” by Alessia Cara - This empowering anthem celebrates inner beauty and self-acceptance, encouraging us to embrace our uniqueness and imperfections!
3. “Rise Up” by Andra Day - This song inspires strength and perseverance in the face of adversity, reminding us that we have the ability to overcome challenges and emerge stronger.
4. “Beautiful” by Christina Aguilera - This heartfelt ballad celebrates inner strength and resilience, encouraging us to embrace our true selves and recognize our inherent worth and beauty.
I hope these words will continue to encourage you to press on, regardless of what others say about you. You’re unique and wonderful, don’t let anyone make you believe otherwise!",,2,,12578,,12578.0,

Enjoy your day though!
Till this day I still HATE living (specifically) as a human being. The purpose of living as a human is vague and differs for sure, but at the end of the day the actions of a human never contribute to earth in a way like (quite literally) every other living organism that has or had walked on the very same ground we do today.* To me, I love the very concept of life and living in general, the sheer complexity needed for an organism no matter the size to even exist is something I am completely facinated by. From things like food chains to survival instincts differing from animal to animal, saying that I am completely blown away by the fact that earth had such a big stroke of luck that such things like this can bloom and thrive is a MASSIVE understatement. Which brings us to the duality of humanity and every other living creature. While many apex predators of the world have natural limits that prevent them from being too powerful, that can’t be said about humanity. Humanity is way too smart, way too powerful, speaking in terms of playing a pvp game (between animals and humans), it would be as if us humans were quite literally hacking. We completely tip the scales of what’s “normal” in this world, and (for the most part and the foreseeable future imo,) we don’t use our ability to help the very place that birthed us; earth.**
- One could always argue that my passion for the planet could be used as motivation to further my studies and one day solve issues that us humans face today (global warming, extinction of animals etc. Etc.), I personally do not see a future where this is something that can be (fully) achieved. Between the differences between countries, people’s needs, personalities, EVERYTHING that makes a human special is a double edged sword when it comes to solving issues like this. The forever net positive and increasing human population does not help, and as dark as this sounds, I don’t believe that humanity will be able to resolve much of the big threats before we ourselves go extinct from them. (Especially with the points mentioned above, + so many more points that I won’t state)

But our impact on this planet due to such ambition has caused near irreversible (at this point) damage that (like I mentioned before,) I don’t believe we can solve/ reverse in time.
In a nutshell,
I really don’t think humans should have existed.
I am completely ashamed of being human,
And I, a human myself, hate humanity. Something that I can never admit of speak of openly due to fear.
But I really do HATE. HATE. HATE HUMANITY.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with this pretty existential take on humanity, what it means to be human in that context, and how you truly feel about it…I wanna commend you on having the self-awareness and insight to come up with your views. Plus, this forum definitely and can be a place to discuss such relevant content - this can be a place for open discourse.
First off, I’m curious when did you start having these deep thoughts and going through with these feelings? Also, strong feelings tend to carry a message indicating something unmet or had been taken away from you. If you were to explore and look behind your disdain for humanity, what other beliefs are surfacing for you or what is it trying to tell you about yourself?
You made an interesting point regarding the duality of hating humanity’s impact on the world and fascinated by how humanity came to be based on having the right conditions. To me, that says one can despise humanity yet be ok or even be impressed with aspects of being a human such as valuing achievement, striving for knowledge, having empathy regarding all creatures, etc. What do you think are your other values ? Perhaps you can note them down and give them some thought? I find that values can kinda be a guide to help us navigate life that is true to who we ARE and want to BE, despite what’s going on around us.
While you tackle these big think topics, hopefully with some input from the community, do allow me to share some exercises, that if you’re up for it, can try to help with any distressing feelings from overwhelming you.
• Being mindful of the present moment
• Being kind to yourself in the face of the harsh reality
I’m also curious to hear more from you as I think that there’s definitely more that we can learn from each other in a supportive manner.

He is a man of science so to speak and his mom is a woman of faith.
But when his mom breaks down he said something that reaffirms life.
If the gravity of the universe was just 1% Stronger, everything would collapse and it was just 1% Weaker, everything would drift away.
Which means there is a Divine Force that created the universe ( Be whatever your religious persuasion )
Personally I would rather be a cat and meow all day. But Who are we to question why the way things are - In this case being Human when that was predetermined by a Divine Force ?
The right question to ask is what is my role in this universe. Yeah it sucks huh that we cant choose what creature we want to be, our race, our family, our social stature etc. But making the most of what IS and how we move ahead is what is really needed.

first of all, right now im in a 5 month relationship with my now bf, i was in a pretty toxic relationship back then with my ex of 2 years
basically, my ex would grope me, threathen to unalive himself if id leave him, cheat on me countless of times then lying to me about it, manipulate me and even gaslit me into thinking that i was in the wrong after we broke up
i was heartbroken and traumatized by that event, but my childhood best friend (my now bf) helped me get through all the traumatic events i have had in my life, hes a total green flag, but now i am worrying that now i am the red flag
i am not using my trauma as an excuse, but i have been always overthinking alot of things and im having major trust issues with my now bf, and weve been through alot of fights because of it, i have been thinking that hes not been prioritizing me,etc. and now our relationship is really rocky and he asked to break up today, i managed to convince him not to but im not sure how im going to handle this
i honestly just want to heal at this point but i dont know how, i want to trust people again and not having any distress with people touching me all of a sudden or overthinking that much, because honestly i dont want this relationship to fall because of my trauma.

Thank you for sharing with us your troubles here, I hear you and I’m so sorry to hear about the pain and trauma you’ve endured in your past relationship. It sounds incredibly difficult to have experienced such toxic behavior from your ex-partner. I can see that these experiences have left deep scars and are impacting your current relationship with your boyfriend.
I understand that you’re grappling with trust issues and finding it hard to let go of past hurts, but I also commend you that you’re seeking ways to address these difficulties and trying to save your current relationship.
One important step you might consider is seeking support from a therapist or counselor as this can provide a safe space for you to explore your feelings, process your experiences, and develop coping strategies to manage your trust issues and overthinking. I want to encourage you that your past traumas can be worked on with the help of a mental health professional, so please don’t hesitate to reach out to one. There are a few options you can try: either your school counsellors, or a professional from a nearby Family Service Centre ( https://www.msf.gov.sg/our-services/directories ) or you can try these online options too:
- Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
- ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
Another thing to remember is that having open and honest communication with your partner is also important. I think it’s so important for you to express your feelings and concerns to him, as well as to listen to his perspective. Together, you can work on finding ways to support each other through this difficult time and strengthen your relationship.
It will also be good to set boundaries for yourself, as it is also part of healing from past trauma. You can practice establishing clear boundaries that make you feel safe and respected, and rebuild trust and create a healthier dynamic in your relationship.
Self-care is vital too! Make sure to prioritize activities that help you relax and recharge, whether it’s spending time with supportive friends and family, engaging in hobbies you enjoy, or practicing mindfulness and meditation.
Last but not least, you can try to read up more or educate yourself about trauma, trust issues, and healthy relationships which can also be empowering. When we understand the underlying dynamics, it can help us all to make informed decisions more effectively.
Please do remember that healing takes time and patience . It’s okay to take things one step at a time and seek support. If you ever feel overwhelmed or unsure about how to move forward, don’t hesitate to reach out here again.

It’s really commendable that you want to work on this, it also shows me that your relationship with your current boyfriend is one that is very valuable to you.
I would agree with cottonsoul that you might want to consider professional support like individual therapy but maybe also consider couple’s therapy so that there’s someone neutral to provide support and guidance to both of y’all.
It’s important to have open communication and honest conversations with your boyfriend and set realistic expectations and boundaries with each other.

I’m not an expert but I think everyone has their own timeline to heal. You mentioned the toxic relationship lasted 2 years so maybe you need a bit longer than 5 months to recover from this.

I’m really sorry to hear, navigating through relationships can be tough and we can’t force someone to get together with us but I believe that there’s some circle/ form of influence… you can sit down with your boyfriend, have a heart to heart conversation, it’s important to be sincere and genuine in expressing how you really feel and find a way to work through your arguments and fights in an amicable way.

I am no stranger to that. Over the past 2 decades I have had my share of it and feel that its unfair and it doesn’t bear fruit.
It’s frustrating, Depressing and i often get very work out by it.
One metaphor is working out in the gym for the past 6 months without seeing any results so you try harder and all you get is tiredness and frustration.
"" Life’s Work "" is the apt term to describe putting work into something for decades. To others it might just be - Its just Music, Acting ,Dancing Or Whatever it is etc but to the person that has put in the years of grit its really heart breaking when you have worked for something for so long, Hoping, that you get to taste the fruit of your labour.
But here is the thing. Its not the end when we are faced with rejections or being beaten down. Its to dust ourselves and Move forward. Perhaps try out new things and experiences. I assure you however that there is a few souls that you have touched that wishes you well and that you Never give up or Give In.
Didn’t get that role, recognition or accolate that you have yearned for does mean that it has all gone to ■■■■. There are still people out there that Loves what you do, no matter how small. Do it for these people that adores your Life Work and for yourself.
This is a reminder to myself as well to finish what i started decades ago and have the courage to try new things. And not to be daunted by rejections or unfavourable outcome that may come.

I agree with @Jaws that only an actual psychiatrist or certified psychologist can diagnose you. The symptoms you’re experiencing may or may not be because of a condition, sometimes we just feel the way we feel due to circumstances/ experiences. It’s important to monitor your symptoms and jot down how it’s been affecting you.
I hear your fear, it’s a very valid fear but I would still encourage you to seek help because it’s not healthy to scroll through the internet and reading books (I’m guilty of this) seeking for answers. It can bring about a peace of mind to seek professional help to provide some answers, guidance and support.
If you’d like there’s many youth centric places like care corner (Mental Health for Youth (INSIGHT) - Care Corner Singapore l ) that provides free anonymous mental health screening and even fully subsidised therapy for youths. I believe they won’t break confidentiality unless it’s an absolute need (high risk of harm to self or others) or if they require parental involvement, they’ll seek your approval first and work something out with you, it’s important to vocalists your needs.

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles and concerns, I hear you and it sounds like you’re going through a lot right now, and it’s completely understandable to feel confused and overwhelmed by your emotions. It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings and reach out for support and I commend you for that.
Feeling a range of emotions, including anger, sadness, and loneliness, is a normal part of being human. However, when these feelings start to interfere with your daily life and relationships, it’s important to explore what might be underlying them.
You mentioned feeling unsure if you’re experiencing depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. It’s very normal to question what’s going on when emotions fluctuate so frequently. While the internet and books can provide some information, they can’t replace the expertise of a mental health professional who can help you understand your experiences in the context of your unique situation. It’s always best to speak to mental health professionals if you would like a diagnosis or to understand deeper about your struggles. You can try calling or walking in to a nearby > Family Service Centre to speak to one about your worries.
I also hear your concerns about privacy and trust. Confidentiality is a cornerstone of therapy, and therapists are bound by ethical guidelines to keep your information private. If you’re still hesitant, you could consider seeking out online therapy options or support groups where you can connect with others anonymously. Here are some options:

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with fatigue that’s affecting your performance in school - it must be difficult trying to re-energise yourself, which I would imagine gonna be tiring too…
And with how your affected at school (difficulty with remembering complex topics) I wonder if lying down in bed is kinda a restraint collapse because you were so overwhelmed in school, you no longer want to hold it all together when you get back home (scrolling through your phone).
I also wonder when you said, “I want to have more energy to work on the things that give meaning to me like drawing or studying or just anything that can improve my life currently” - if what you’re feeling and experiencing is similar to anhedonia where you find it hard to feel pleasure from things that used to be enjoyable. Have you experienced this situation with school before? If yes, did something happen to have led you to feel this way?
Your physical health is tied closely to your mental wellbeing so as much as you can work on increasing your body’s energy levels through regular exercises, healthy and regular meals, staying hydrated, prioritising restful sleep, engaging in relaxing activities, staying connected, etc. - you’ll also need to work on increasing your brain chemicals by being kinder to yourself, setting goals, focusing on positivity, and practising gratitude, etc.
I wonder if you’ve had the chance to share this with someone? Perhaps someone you feel safe with and can trust to help you - like your school counsellor - before it gets too overwhelming for you to cope with.

I do think that life has never been continuously smooth sailing. There has been times of strong tides, thunderstorms but also times when there were calm waters - which was always easier to live through. Most of us are waiting for when there’s calm waters. But in reality, we never really know when this moment would come. We need to be courageous to brave through storms while learning to keep ourselves afloat nonetheless. It’s okay to be scared. But fear shouldn’t stop us from moving forward. That’s the very beauty of life. It teaches us how strong we can be. And when we get tired, take a break! Catch a breather and when we feel ready to get back out there again, we continue sailing.
I don’t know of anyone who can tell me that things have been great their entire life. But we keep the wonderful memories close to heart and treasure them. One thing that a friend of mine has taught me before, is to learn to laugh at ourselves. It’s been at least 3 years since he taught me that and i’m still trying to practise it. Sometimes i’m able to humour myself with how dramatic my life can be. Other times, i just wonder why things have to be so tough. But i’m thankful for the people around me who never fail to be there for me to lean on. I also believe that we’ve all been built with what we need to keep ourselves afloat. It’s all within us. We just need to discover these things about us.

Thank you for sharing about your struggles with your parents criticism and wanting to find a way to overcome this. I wanna commend you for your self-awareness and that it must’ve been difficult to remain in that distressing cycle where they undermine you…
Although there seems to be a difference of opinion between you and your parents, it sounds like you wanna express it in a more helpful manner. I get it, you’re also an adult capable of making informed decisions so I wonder if it would be helpful to have an open discussion where everyone’s not in a rush and in a calm setting. This will enable your to be heard by sharing your thoughts with I statements: “I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like done instead)”. This way, you can get your concerns across and in a manner that your parents can listen and hopefully see from your point-of-view.
And perhaps, that can clear the way for y’all to meet halfway to create a win-win situation. Most importantly everyone should feel comfortable with the outcome by brainstorm ideas on options/alternatives for mutual gain that doesn’t disadvantage anyone. Of course, this is probably not a one-off conversation but likely to be continuous so tap on your coping abilities to try to tolerate the frustration. You can also try out these practices to see if it helps you too:
• Being mindful
• Being kind to yourself
I hear you talking about certain food choices but I wonder if there’s more than just that. Does this happen for other matters too? If so, what patterns do you notice about the differences in opinion? Does this happen to you in other situations or with other people?
As for your parents, I wonder in their actions towards you - is it kinda like a way of looking out for you - although you’re at an age where you’re capable of doing so yourself. And I suppose this frustrates you as you’re kinda denied the autonomy and choice. If wonder if your parents were exercising their need in terms of their social relationship (e.g., wanting you to abide by their wishes, harping on your negative reactions, etc.) with you, while you were exercising your need for independence and identity (e.g., as much as you’re their child, you’re also an adult). This would require some navigating and delicate balancing on what sort of behaviours would be helpful towards one another while honouring the updated roles each of you need to be playing as parent and child.

I can safely say that this often happens to me in other situations as well as with other where I am forced to comply with decisions without even being asked for input being denied autonomy and choice, this has been going on since my days in school as well. I was often told that I can’t be my own self or have my own decisions because I would always be a loser and stupid. My sense and self-identity and confidence had been badly affected since then.
Whatever opinions that have been passed about me and all these things happening at the same time makes me feel like no matter what my choices are and how I feel about certain things it always ends up with me being blamed and labeled as the spoilt one, the anxious one and the one who still keeps behaving like a child when all I want is for people to see things from my perspective and if they’re still not happy with it its fine by me. I often feel like because of these situations mentioned thus far people are tired of me wanting to be autonomous and independent
Thanks for the advice though. I will keep that in mind and I hope that you would keep hearing me out and giving such advice as this

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles - especially with the looming chem exam and speech! I can’t imagine how nerve-wrecking it is, and how it’s overwhelming your coping. Nonetheless, what you’re thinking and feeling about your situation is valid given the circumstances.
I think it would be helpful to listen to your mind and body regarding taking a break. It’s a positive and helpful behaviour to take a step back to honour what you need at the moment (be it rest, or distance to reflect on the situation and reenergise to tackle it). At the same time, you still need to honour your commitments to others and manage your school responsibilities. Has something similar happened to you before? If yes, what did you do before that helped? I also wonder if you had a chance to speak to someone about this (perhaps your school counsellor or a trusted friend/family member) - at least to get some support?
Perhaps this is where prioritising and doing things one at a time to not stretch your concentration and energy levels, while you try to find pockets of time to rest and regulate your emotions through deep breathing and engaging in a short relaxing/calming activity - helps you to strategise what to do. I wonder what would be the easiest (by comparison) and most immediate task you can deal with? And if there’s a gap in skill/information, what do you need (and where can you get it) to close the gap? I also wonder if it’s possible to relook at the timelines for some of these tasks - like requesting for more time or reschedule to a slightly later time?
Also, I wonder about your anxiety and what’s the thoughts behind that emotion for you? As emotions serve as a messenger, is there a threat to something you value that makes you anxious; sometimes our immediate reaction is to make sudden changes or avoid the thing (to reduce the anxious feelings) before we find some clarity and respond in a way that addresses the threat… I hope things get better and I wish you all the best for your exam! Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need. Looking forward to hearing back from you, take care!",,2,,,,,

Honestly I went through the same emotions when I was in secondary school. My friends were rather superficial initially and I could not really connect with them beyond school related stuff. best thing was that my family members started stamping that I was an introvert who disliked socialising. As a matter of fact, I was able to do well for my English oral exams in secondary school and now when I am in poly I scored As and Distinction for modules related to communication.
Personally, I feel that you should just press on by indulging in smt u like. Pursue your hobby and if you have friends outside school, spend more time with them. For my case, I wanted to show that not everyone can fit into the common stereotypes of society. I chose to focus on my studies in school and socialise with people who will better understand me (my primary school friends). In essence, try regaining yourself by embracing your personality. It maybe tough, but trust me, it’ll worth the struggle.

Although my parents did not verbalise this, I felt ignored and constantly compared with an older sibling who is performing academically exceptionally well. When I did something incorrect, I get responses from my parents in a harsh and critical tone. To add salt to the wound, One of my parent is also having mental issues (insecure, tend to say things that doesn’t exist in reality) And for few years, the other parent and I was at the receiving end of accusations (Like we are having affair) when in fact I was molested in a public area and I couldn’t get the help and support needed back then.
Somehow I managed to surpress my emotions back then and did well academically to get into the course I wanted to study because I wanted to prove to my parents I can do it. This is despite the fact I have problems with reading and comprehending key points in messages and discussions as I have tendency to drift away during conversations. And relying on pure memorization to clear academic exams. I thought I have overcome these issues when I got married, had a family of my own and had a career which I was contented and happy with.
These issues of low self esteem, lack of confidence and self worth resurfaced when I left my job to focus on taking care of my child who has been diagnosed with special needs (highly functional). At the same period of time, one of my parent was diagnosed with cancer so I ended up managing both issues. And to add on, my spouse confessed infidelity through a series of one night stands happening over a period of 8 years, went through depression because of guilt and fear of contracting STDs. Given such circumstances, I was forced to go back to workforce earlier than expected. My spouse expected me to show sympathy, understanding and forgiveness towards him. When this didnt happened the way expected, a lawyer was engaged to start divorce proceedings. Eventually this fell through as we didn’t agree with terms and conditions.
As an result, my child who had taken PSLE was affected. For myself, I took on a job which had steep learning curve. Coupled with the work environment and culture, I find myself struggling to deal with fear and anxiety to the extent of unable to sleep well at night, blanking out at work, taking longer time than expected to deal with task on hands because lack of mentoring (expected to read, research to find solutions).
I’m not sure if this would be the time to throw in the towel. And appreciate some advice to deal with fear and anxiety issues.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your worries and concerns, I hear you and it sounds like you’ve been through an incredibly challenging journey, one that has tested your resilience in more ways than one. The emotional weight of your past experiences, coupled with the present responsibilities of caring for your child with special needs and supporting a parent with cancer, is undoubtedly overwhelming.
Your story reflects immense strength and determination, especially in your efforts to pursue your academic and professional goals despite the obstacles you faced growing up. However, it’s completely understandable that these unresolved issues from your past have resurfaced in the face of current stressors.
The betrayal and subsequent turmoil in your marriage must have been devastating, particularly when you were already stretched thin emotionally and logistically. I can see that you’ve been carrying a heavy burden for quite some time, and it’s completely valid to feel overwhelmed, fearful, and anxious given all that’s on your plate.
In times like these, I would like to suggest 3 things that may be helpful for you:
2. Please consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in areas such as trauma, anxiety, and family dynamics. A trained professional can provide you with a safe and supportive environment to process your emotions, develop coping strategies, and work through past traumas. Therapy can offer you support so that you can make the right decisions for yourself and your child. You can try reaching out to a therapist from a nearby family service centre for extra support too.
3. Continue to surround yourself with understanding and empathetic people who can offer emotional support and practical assistance. This could include friends, family members, support groups, or online communities for caregivers. When you connect with others who can relate to your experiences, it can help alleviate feelings of isolation and provide validation and encouragement during difficult times.
4. Make self-care a priority in your daily routine, even if it’s just small acts of kindness towards yourself This could involve setting aside time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, listening to music, or practicing mindfulness and meditation. Prioritizing adequate rest, nutrition, and exercise can also have a huge impact on your overall well-being and resilience in managing stress and anxiety! You could try out activities like mindfulness, deep breathing, declutter your mind , and more importantly be kind to yourself
Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. You’ve been shouldering a tremendous amount of responsibility and emotional weight for far too long. It’s okay to prioritize your own well-being and seek the help and support you need to work through this difficult chapter in your life. I also want to affirm you again that you’ve already shown incredible resilience and strength, and I believe that you’ll find the courage and clarity to seek the support you need.
Please let me know how you’re coping so far and if you’ve reached out to any therapist for help. Keep us updated here!

First off, I’d like to commend you on coming on to share about your experience - especially to reach out when you’re having low mood, guilt and feeling hopeless… It must’ve been tough to go through it and not finding joy in activities or seeking connection with others.
Secondly, what you’re experiencing is valid given your situation; these are typical human emotions when one’s coping seem to be unable to cope from being overwhelmed. If we look at your emotions as a messenger - I wonder what is it trying to let you know? Have you experienced this before? Have you noticed if it’s brought about by something? Let’s try to see what’s behind those emotions like what kind of thoughts are driving them, is there a need not being met, was there something that was taken away from you?
In the meantime, to help with the distress perhaps you can try out the below activities:
• Being mindful
• Being kind to yourself
• Shifting (to a more helpful) perspective
It would be helpful to be able to get support from others, especially from those close to you but your expectations doesn’t seem to match up with the support from your parents. I wonder if it’ll help if you’re able to feel heard and understood in order to truly get the support that is unique to you and your situation. At the same time, your experience of life (“wake, work, eat, work, eat, sleep, and repeat”) perhaps don’t match up to what you value like immersing yourself in reading/games and cooking (perhaps creating/crafting something for yourself and/or others?). Here is an opportunity where you can take stock of your values and to see what’s really important to you in life - what do you think are your values ? Perhaps you can note them down and give them some thought. I find that values can kinda be a guide to help us live a life that is true to who we ARE and want to BE.
Also, if you feel that it’s still difficult to cope and you’re feeling overwhelmed, you can seek out support in a professional and non-judgmental manner from:
- Family Service Centres
- James Cook University Clinic
- NIE Wellness Centre
- NUS Clinical & Health Psychology Centre
Remember that you deserve and can get the support you need. I’m willing to listen and I hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you for sharing, I’m not a professional but I would encourage you to speak to a professional like a Counsellor, coach or therapist if this is something that you feel has been bothering and affecting you.
Seeking professional help doesn’t mean that that there is something necessarily wrong with you, it could be that you need some advice, coaching and seeking another perspective to your issues. You could explore your feelings and co create solutions to your issues (in your case, trying to cope with lost of interest etc).
I would say it’s normal to want to find something more than just work, eat, sleep repeat. It could mean that you’re just trying to find something that excites you or something you can look forward to and I hope you do find it!

Was reflecting about what @BKT said that might be helpful for you, @Relay7707.
How do you feel about this change? Do you want to be able to enjoy the things you used to like or do you actually feel okay about this? You talked about how you should “go out and touch grass” - is that something you want or is that more like a society standard that you feel compelled to follow?

Actually… this sounds like me. I’ve always thought that I was just forgetful but I’ve started noticing that the things I “forget” are negative experiences. It sounds like some sort of coping mechanism, would love to hear more from the therapists.
My partner always complains that I’m forgetful because my brain just chooses to “hide” these memories (along with other related memories). And I guess it’s not very helpful for heart-to-heart talks when we want to be vulnerable and go deep into our emotions because I just can’t remember.
I also have altered memories sometimes. For example, I will tell my partner that I felt a certain way during that incident (eg sad) but I will remember it differently after a couple of weeks. So I guess our memories are unreliable to some extent.
Also, if you suspect you have depression, maybe it’s best to get it checked by a professional. Don’t over rely on internet research haha"," https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-am-quite-confused-about-myself/8378/1; unreliable 1 https://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/61729#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%20the,remember'%20events%20that%20never%20happened.",1,,12225,,,12225

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with your sadness and depressed mood. I want to also commend you on your self-awareness in terms of identifying what you’re going through and given your situation, what you were feeling and thinking are valid too. I hear you about the depressed mood , and it does not need to reach clinical levels for a diagnosis for you to experience some of the symptoms (e.g., negative thinking, sadness for an extended period, helplessness, etc.). We also do not want your ability to cope to be too overwhelmed before you consider professional support.
Again I wanna commend you for reaching out here as well as your attempts to disclose with your parents (although I’m sorry to hear that the experience wasn’t as positive as I’d guessed you’d hope for), as well as trying to maintain a positive demeanour despite the inner turmoil that you’re going through At the same time, it feels like you’ve developed a coping mechanism whereby it sounds like you dissociate or disconnect when you ‘forget’ as a way to manage your mood although at the expense of forgetting other things too. There are cases where the mind dissociates to cope with the overwhelming stress from an actual traumatic experience or even with distressing memories.
You mentioned thinking this happened since you were young - I wonder if something happened just about when this started for you? If we see this experience of your depressed mood as a way to cope, what sort of a need is not being met/neglected/taken away from you? Would there be people you feel safe and comfortable with to disclose to - perhaps a school counsellor or a trusted friend?
Although it is life’s condition and human nature to be sometimes both “normal and not normal at the same time” but it should be during certain times and within your ability to tolerate difficult emotions and coping healthily. Perhaps to help with the distress, you can try to bolster your mood by doing activities that you enjoy, continue to engage in social activities (as we’re still social creatures and to prevent further isolation), being kind to yourself, and shifting (to a more helpful) perspective. While this might help with your experience in the meantime, it helps to work on any underlying issues that might be maintaining the depressed mood if not addressed. Perhaps you can consider reaching out should you feel like engaging professional help in a supportive and non-judgmental manner:
- Samaritans of Singapore (1-767)
- Family Service Centres
- James Cook University Clinic
- NIE Wellness Centre
- NUS Clinical & Health Psychology Centre
You are a strong person and you can also get help. Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need. I look forward to hearing from you - till then, take care!",mood 1 https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/mindsg/caring-for-ourselves/understanding-depression-adults#home; kind https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=be_kind; perspective https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-well-being-toolkit/202002/how-shift-perspective-when-youre-stuck-in-your-own-way; Centres https://www.msf.gov.sg/our-services/directories; Clinic 1 https://www.jcu.edu.sg/about-us/our-resources; Centre https://www.ntu.edu.sg/nie/about-us/campus-facilities/nie-wellness-centre; Centre https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/clinical-and-health-psychology-centre/,2,,,,,

and yeah! i agree, i think i’ve also altered my memory before. like for example, i’ve always thought that my primary school experience is stressful and sad, but then recently I’ve came across a notebook where the primary school kid me went to find for teachers and classmates to write a note for me in p6 graduation. when i read it omg it sounds so wholesome and happy and i felt so happy because everyone seemed to think of me as a kind, helpful, smart friend and some even look up to me!!! haha i wonder why brain alteration happens.
lastly, yeah, i’ve talked about seeking help from a professional to my mom and we went to book an appointment last year. i think the appointment is going to be on april? i’m not very sure anymore ahaha >~< i feel like this coping mechanism wouldn’t be really good for me as sometimes, i also forget memories related to my studies and happy things that has happened to me. and thank you for sharing! i appreciate it",,1,,12277,12277.0,,

and um i also forgot but i feel like i’ve been crying silently for so long i don’t know how people can cry loudly with the wah wah sounds. during that period of time, mm well i’m the kind of person where the more i think about the sad thing, the more sad i will be.
and i didnt have friends who knows how to listen to people. like, whenever i confide in them about my feelings on a certain matter, they’ll change the topic really quickly and yeah… i’ve realised that the friend was rather toxic and i didn’t like how she was treating me. for eg she told me once that she’s only cruel/rude to me because i’m close to her, and that she could only be herself around me. we were in the same school but she dropped out bc she couldn’t keep up with the syllabus (more like she just never studied and listened in class so… i’ve tried to help her and study together but it didn’t seem to help. i mean, she didn’t even seem like she wants to help herself on this so , i couldn’t help her too.) so yeah and bc we live so far away, we just talked over social media. and i told her that i would never block someone unless they are scammers/ someone i hate very very much. and she , she blocked me once for fun and when i wanted to say hi to her, she’s like “aHa, i wonder who this blocked message is from” or something, i can’t really remember. but she sounded so smug about it, i got a bit annoyed. nevertheless, i decided to give her a chance bc people aren’t perfect! just wanted to give her a chance to change but she blocked me again the second time because i told her i got new friends and she’s like, really jealous about it. she would literally ask me if she’s my top 1 in my heart and it’s annoying how she always need to find for someone else to tell me about what she felt instead. while blocking me at the same time. i just feel like she should just straight up tell me about what she felt instead of getting another person because i felt really bad. the other person is literally working and studying in uni at the same time i guess she don’t know how to express about her feelings straight up to the person ig. and she will always trash talk about herself even when i always tell her not to, that its not true. she just keeps on saying so much about her being trash that i cant even bother anymore. perhaps it sounds a bit harsh but i have my limits too o-o i just feel like… 3 years of talking trash of herself is too much… like, if she thinks she’s fat for like 3 years+, if she don’t like how she look like now, stop lamenting for 3 years!! start action. so yeah i’ve stopped finding for her for months now though i would still reply to her if she finds me o-o just not as enthusiastic as before anymore.
um right i got a bit off topic but yeah normally when i have time to think about sad things that has happened on that day, it’s normally at night when i can’t sleep (bc i normally take 30min to fall asleep and in the 30min, i would think about things that has happened and i will reflect on myself) so yeah… in the end i just cry myself to sleep. o-o
i think a need that has been taken away from me, well… i just think that, from sec 1 till now, i’ve just never heard my parents praising me before. they would always use pressure to push me to do better and would always compare me to the better kids in school. last time, when i did better than before, and i tell them about my marks happily, my mom would always be like “what’s the highest marks in the whole cohort?” or, “how much did your friend get?” meanwhile, my dad doesn’t care about my academics. i think one year ago, he said something like he’s just given up on me and um i am so sad.
i feel like, sure pressuring a kid to do better might be a good way, but too much just … i think i get anxious whenever exams come near and whenever results are out, my feelings are like, numbed. if i get relatively good marks, i wouldnt feel very happy and if i get marks below my expectation, i wouldnt feel disappointed too cause i suppose, i just expected that i would do terribly
thankfully currently i got like 2 good friends that i think are rather close to me!! i have someone to confide in and ummm well, he might not be the best but he’ll give suggestions and ways i can solve my issue. i appreciate it but i sometimes feel like words are so easy to say but actions are not as easy to do. lol. but maybe bc we came from diff families and had different experiences, he’ll find some things easy but i’ll find it hard instead. like for example, he says i should get a positive mindset and i also know i should, but i don’t know how to. and sometimes when i say things in a certain way, he’ll be like “instead of saying it like this, you should say it like that.” sometimes he does it so much i felt pressurised and that he’s expecting so much of me i don’t think i can live up to his expectations, . but i talked to him about it! other than that, he’s a really cool friend and yeah cares for me. my other friend! she’s so cool too! she’s very admirable and we’ll share about interesting things that has happened to us; she’ll also confide in me because she thinks i’m a safe person to talk to; she also supports me!!! i find for her whenever i need help w my studies. she also finds for me when she needs help too, like for chemistry.
i think these two friends are so good because both motivates me to study and good memories are being created because of them so i’m very grateful of them to be willing to be my friend i feel so lucky to have met the both of them.
yes, i feel like i should be kind to myself too but i don’t know how to do that. i’m struggling to do that but nowadays i suppose i’m not being as negative about myself than before already! i’m trying to improve myself (although i’m really really slow on this) in the future, i hope that i would be able to love myself and become an independent woman who’s charming and cool www , where i can pursuit a job that i’m interested in, where i can wear any pretty clothes i like and be confident in it, where i can finally stop caring so obsessively about other’s opinions on me, and focus more on my opinion on me.
on another side note, i’ve been thinking of being a psychologist when i grow up because i want to learn more about myself and maybe learn the ways of self healing if i still did not manage to do so. i also want to help others who have mental illnesses too because i don’t wish for them to be like me, getting troubled and not knowing how to help themselves. but apparently my friend says that taking a psychology major is really risky as some people might not even get a job after 1 year of graduation. mm… i’m not very sure on this and would like to see if anyone has comments on this? (tbh another good point he has made is the fact that i’m strong enough emotionally and mentally to accept patients who have serious mental illnesses because i’ve heard about psychologists getting depression after treating the patients…? mm…i’m not sure, all i know is that psychology fascinates me and i find it so interesting to know about how the mind works and all.)

I woke up to them letting me know that both of them had sex with me which i did not consent to because i was blacked out drunk. At the time i was shocked but i was okay with it and didn’t think of it as rape because i thought it was okay for them to do that because at the least, they told me. And i still stayed friends with them and was around them a lot because we were in the same friend group. I was fine and even laughed when they made jokes about what they did to me. I had times where i felt uncomfortable being around them but just kept it to myself and was still hanging out with them. A year later i questioned myself about it but brushed it off.
Now, 3 years later, my boyfriend who is their friend too, found out from one of our friends that it happened but he was told that i was conscious and just had sex with them. I now then realised that it was rape, but is it still rape if i was okay with it after they told me?
Is it still rape if ONLY after 3 years i realised that it is? Is it still rape if i told them it was okay but now i feel like it isn’t? Is it still rape if i continued being friends with them & brushed it off like it never happened? Is it still rape even if i joked about it myself? Is it still rape? Because right now i really feel like i have no value and is disgusted with myself to the point that i really thought i deserved it. I feel so ashamed that i actually allowed it to happen and EVEN TOLD THEM that it was okay. Maybe i was confused? Or maybe it just wasn’t rape and i was just exaggerating and being overly dramatic.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us your concerns and worries, I hear you and I want you to know that your questions and feelings are valid.

I would like you to please consider reporting it to the relevant authorities by calling the police, and also to speak to AWARE. It is important for you to reach out for support as soon as you can.

Thank you for sharing with us your pain, I hear you and I’m truly sorry you’re going through such a difficult time. It sounds incredibly painful to have invested so much love and trust into a relationship, only to have it end in such a hurtful way. Feeling betrayed and unworthy of love after experiencing such manipulation and deception is completely understandable. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your feelings and to try to move forward, especially when the pain feels overwhelming.
I want to encourage you to remember that your worth isn’t defined by the actions or words of someone else. You are deserving of love and respect, regardless of what you’ve been through. And while it’s natural to feel lost and confused right now, please know that healing takes time. It’s okay to allow yourself to grieve the loss of the relationship and to feel all the emotions that come with it.
It’s also important to lean on the support of those who care about you. Even if you feel like you’ve hurt them, they likely still love and care for you deeply. Opening up to them about what you’re going through can help lighten the burden and remind you that you’re not alone.
I would like to encourage you to reach out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in relationships and emotional healing. They can provide you with a safe space to process your feelings, explore coping strategies, and develop healthy ways to move forward. They can also help you regain a sense of self-worth and rebuild your confidence. Here are some ways you can speak to a counsellor:
2. Nearby Family Service Centre
3. Online options:
- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
- ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
Do also try to take care of yourself, both physically and emotionally, especially during this time. If exercise helps distract you from the pain, then keep doing it. Finding healthy outlets for your emotions, whether it’s through journaling, therapy, or spending time with loved ones, can also be very beneficial for you.
Last but not least, please do be kind and patient with yourself as you heal. Self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend in a similar situation.
Remember, healing is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Be gentle with yourself, and know that brighter days are ahead, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. You are stronger than you know, and you will find your way through this.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your workplace struggles in your department after probation. I hear you finding it hard to cope with the workload to the point of breaking down; it’s also affecting your current performance and making you anxious - I think what you’re experiencing is valid given the circumstances.
It sounds that you took proactive steps to mention to colleagues/manager about the workload but the outcome doesn’t sound positive. I wonder in your other experiences dealing with people, what would work for you in this situation other than the actions you’ve taken or how it can be different than what you’ve tried - especially with getting your needs heard in a way that is assertive and allows negotiation for a win-win situation (instead of current arrangement) for all parties. Could there be someone else you can speak to about this - perhaps a person that you trust and is supportive, like a higher up or someone from HR Dept - in an open discussion where you get your needs heard clearly and without judgment or appearing pushy/demanding.
I also hear you mentioning your volunteering commitment - that sounds like something that is aligned with your values, I wonder what you find satisfying in that role (perhaps the sense of connection with people or sense of achievement from helping others)? Maybe you can harness that energy to seek out a constructive arrangement that works for all parties.
In the meantime, you can bolster your distress tolerance by trying out:
- engaging in deep breathing and being mindful to modulate your stress levels
- being kind to yourself to yourself as you go through a difficult time
- shifting (to a more helpful) perspective

I see, that must be really disappointing. Did they suggest that because they feel that your volunteering commitment is affecting your work performance?
If it’s outside of work then I think you should continue to hold on to what makes you happy. But communication is very important so you’ll have to articulate that you volunteering has no negative impact on your work performance.

Thank you for coming on and sharing about your concerns regarding your relationship. Your thoughts and feelings about how the relationship is perceived by both parties are valid given your circumstances of being unsure.
Nonetheless I wanna commend you for your self-awareness in identifying what’s important to you in a potential partner. No matter what stage of a romantic relationship you find yourself in - be it the early stages or many years into it, open and honest communication has always been cited as one of the main reasons for healthy relationships. I wonder if you’ve had the opportunity to speak to your potential partner about this, perhaps face-to-face using I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like to happen). This way, you can get your concerns across and in a manner that your potential partner can listen and understand clearly. As this is a rather serious topic, choosing a suitable time and place where both are not in a hurry, a conducive location, and in a calm manner will definitely be more helpful.
This could also be an opportunity to take stock on what you each value in a relationship and to evaluate as a couple what your short term expectations and long term needs are. In a way, this allows for an open discussion about middle term goals to find ways to strengthen compatibility and hearing more on shared values when it comes to spending time, raising a family, financial matters, personal goals, etc. and how each of you can support one another (or figure out how) in this endeavour.
And while you’re navigating this with your potential partner and working through specialty training together, perhaps you can consider the below practices to help when you’re feeling distressed:
• Being mindful
• Being kind to yourself
• Shifting (to a more helpful) perspective

This is such a deep question, @Eatmahpuff. There’s no easy answer and there’s this Chinese saying 一山还有一山高 which translate to “for every high mountain, there is an even higher mountain”.
I feel like it’s very hard to feel adequate if you mindlessly chase superficial stuff like income, educational qualifications etc because there will always be someone at your age that earns higher than you or has higher qualifications.
Maybe one way to address this is to do something different from the vast majority of others. It’s easier to be different than to be better. And if you’re lucky or have some smarts, being different will give you a good chance to be better anyway.
And you trying to work full time while studying full time is already quite different from others. You’re in a good place. You’ll get way more experience from your peers when you graduate and that’s going to help your early career life a lot.", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/feeling-like-a-failure/8357/1,1,,12166,,,12166

To answer your question on how people work through this feeling of inadequacy is to stop comparing ourselves with others. We, our lives, are not defined by how much we own in money or cert or status, as much as one may be tempted to think so and what society supposedly values.
Your life’s meaning and value, and your happiness is defined by yourself. Not others. If you don’t value yourself, then no matter what you achieve, you will always feel inadequate because there is no end to comparison.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for that question and for sharing your thoughts! I hear you, and I can sense the weight of your situation and the pressure you’re feeling. It’s really disheartening to have your job contract not renewed because of your commitment to education. It sounds like you’re grappling with a sense of uncertainty about your future and comparing yourself to others who seem to be progressing more smoothly.
Feeling inadequate in a society that often measures success by income, educational qualifications, and job prestige is a common struggle. However, it’s important to recognize that these external markers don’t define your worth or potential. To be frank, when I was younger, I used to feel this way too. And it’s true, comparison is a thief of joy!
One way to work through this feeling of inadequacy is to shift your focus inward and consider what truly matters to you. Reflect on your passions, interests, and values, and think about how you can align your goals with what brings you fulfillment. Remember that success looks different for everyone, and it’s okay to carve out your own path, even if it diverges from the conventional/traditional route
Also, seeking support from friends, family, or a mentor who can offer encouragement and perspective can be invaluable! When you surround yourself with a supportive network, it can help counteract feelings of isolation and boost your confidence as you work through this period of transition.
Lastly, you can consider exploring opportunities for personal and professional growth outside of traditional measures of success. This could involve volunteering, pursuing passion projects, or seeking out internships or part-time work in fields that interest you. These experiences can not only enhance your skill set but also provide a sense of purpose and direction as you work towards your goals
Remember, you are capable and deserving of success on your own terms. It’s okay to take your time to find your path and to prioritize your education and personal growth along the way. Your journey is unique! Stay encouraged and keep walking.

Thank you for being so courageous to share your pain with us here, I hear you and I’m deeply sorry to hear about the pain you’re experiencing in your relationship. It’s really so distressing to feel unappreciated, disrespected, and emotionally abused by someone you love and support. I want you to know that your feelings are valid.
First and foremost, please know that you are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help you through this difficult time. I would really like you to reach out for support from trusted friends, family members, or professionals who can offer you more support directly. For example, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can be very helpful for your situation now. They can provide you with a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping strategies, and make decisions about your relationship and your own well-being.
I would like you to know that it’s important to remember : you deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and love in a relationship. No one deserves to be subjected to verbal or emotional abuse. It’s not your responsibility to fix or change your partner’s behavior, and you shouldn’t have to endure mistreatment for the sake of the relationship.
It also is important to establish boundaries in your relationship to protect your emotional and physical well-being. It might be helpful to communicate with your partner about what behaviors are unacceptable to you and make it clear that you will not tolerate verbal or emotional abuse. If your partner is unwilling to respect your boundaries and make positive changes, it may be necessary to reassess the future of the relationship for your own sake.
Last but not least, I also understand that it might feel overwhelming sometimes that you feel like hurting yourself, but please prioritize your safety and wellbeing above all else. Please do keep these numbers and contact them in case of emergency or in case you find yourself in crisis:

Please know that there is no shame in seeking help for yourself.

- Sexual Assault Care Centre (SACC) : 6779 0282
- SOS : 1767
Secondly, it might be helpful to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in supporting individuals dealing with family issues and depression. They can provide you with a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping strategies, and work towards healing.
Remember, you are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help you through this difficult time. You deserve to find peace and safety. Please consider reaching out for professional help and support. Let me know if you’ve managed to call either of those numbers for advice.

Did you feel better after crying? Actually I think crying is just our body’s natural response to cope with the overwhelming stressors.
I’ve not worked in a media environment before but maybe giving yourself intentional breaks can help to space things out a bit. Even blocking out 15-min slots and doing some deep breathing exercises and help regulate your emotions before going back to the grind.

Thank you for coming on here and sharing about your struggle at the office. I wanna commend you for having the self-awareness to reach out; it must’ve been so overwhelming for you that you found yourself breaking down and exhausted.
First off, crying can be cathartic when it provides relief and based on what you went through, your reaction to the situation is valid. I’m also heartened to hear you wanting to manage your responses better. I wonder if this had happened to you before? If yes, how did you cope with it previously? And what do you think is different from before - could it be that you did not have the same resources you had or you required additional information (given the nature of your work) or is it something else (like related to outside of work)? If that’s the case, what can you do differently the next time you realise something similar happens or how do you get the resources you need? Could there be someone you can speak to about this - perhaps a person that you trust and is supportive - in an open discussion where you get your needs heard clearly and without judgment.
At the same time, you can bolster your distress tolerance by practising when you’re in a calm environment and without distractions:
- engaging in deep breathing and being mindful to modulate your stress levels
- being kind to yourself to yourself as you go through a difficult time
- being assertive in asking for what you need in a clear manner (and that is not demanding or pushy) or negotiating against unreasonable demands
Do let us know what you think about this and remember, you deserve and can get the necessary support you need! Take care!",mindful https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=soothe_your_mind; kind https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=be_kind,1,,,,,

Absolutely, it’s completely normal to feel a sense of uncertainty and even a bit lost when there’s a change in your work dynamic, especially when a supportive manager transitions to a different project. It’s understandable that you may be wondering about the next steps and how to navigate the shift in responsibilities. Consider expressing your feelings to your manager and discussing any concerns or questions you may have about the changes. Additionally, take this opportunity to explore new challenges, set new goals, and seek guidance or mentorship from others in your workplace. Change can be disorienting, but it also presents opportunities for growth and adaptation. Embrace the chance to develop new skills and connections in this evolving work environment.

Thanks for coming on to share about your struggles at work - you feeling overwhelmed and unsure about uncertainty is valid given what you’re going through. I also wanna commend you on your self-awareness to reach out for support to navigate your thoughts and feelings.
It sounds like you have a good bond with your manager and this change is making you “feel lost”. I wonder what your sensing about the amount of control you have over this directive? I can imagine feeling very troubled over something that you had no say about; that’s where this concept of locus of control comes in - where you can feel in control of things or outcomes happen beyond your control (this is on a continuum rather than an either-or state) and you can determine how you want to view the change and what you can do about it
Also, there seems to be something about your manager that you view rather positively - I wonder what that is for you? Would it be possible to have an open discussion with your manager about this and perhaps come up with an action plan together to see what can be done to ease the transition and help you move forward with projects? Perhaps choosing a time where everyone’s not in a hurry and sharing your thoughts with I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like to see happen). This way, you can get your concerns across and in a manner that your manager can listen and understand clearly.
At the same time, do remember to be kind to yourself given the changes you’re experiencing and perhaps can consider shifting perspectives, if it helps. Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need.

I had a good working relationship with someone too and the person got reassigned and it really affected me.

When is this transition happening? Time to step out of your comfort zone haha but I think there are ways to make this smoother. For eg, having a chat with the incoming manager to understand their working style and also share yours. Most supportive mangers would want to be able to help you thrive.
But of course I understand there’s also uncertainty as to who is coming in to be your new manager. If it’s an internal shuffle, there could be a chance that your current mentor knows them too - can try to also catch up with your current mentor to get advice on how to work well with the new manager.
I remember when my mentor left for another company, I was devastated. Like you, we went through some tough times together. Some more it was just a 2-man team, so just him and me. With him leaving, I basically needed to tank everything without proper advice and guidance. It turned out to be a period in my career where I had the most growth. I learned so much and also had a greater appreciation of what he did for me as a manager (basically shielding all the stupid requests and rejecting the low value work). The good news was - after 6 months into his new role, he called me and offered me a job in his team. So it’s a happy ending.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles with anxiety. I wanna commend you for having the self-awareness on the physical symptoms and reaching out - your feelings while going through those situations are valid. I also hear that you had positive experiences with socialising with others in your previous work but finding it harder to socialise nowadays - to the point of your mind going blank. I wonder if this had happened to you before? And if it did, was it a similar kind of a situation? Do you also happen to notice any thoughts crossing your mind just before you find the anxiety getting too much for you?
With anxiety, our mind prepares our body to face potential danger - like a signal that something you value is under threat. Let’s take the example of arriving in another country to meet your boyfriend: I wonder if you thought that you can’t trust yourself to handle all the different things to travel and especially doing it alone, that probably caused you to feel anxious and felt the physical symptoms within your body, that most likely fed the anxiety but you meeting your boyfriend helped as you didn’t feel the need to engage in behaviours to reduce the overwhelming anxiety (some people would remove themselves from the situation completely by escaping/running away).
I wonder if there’s more to to your anxiety than just socialising with people, which is causing you to avoid them to reduce the anxiety temporarily. Given your stage of life (with studies and work), it feels like there’s another transition you’re experiencing - I wonder what do you think about it given that there’s gonna be new opportunities but at the same time more responsibilities; I would imagine that as being quite stressful and anxiety provoking too…
I also think you can reach out to your social circle and share about this with a trusted friend for support. In the meantime, to help with the distress perhaps you can try this exercise in a comfortable and safe space as it helps to refocus on the present moment by shifting focus away from anxious feelings, as well as checking if your thoughts are accurate & helpful . If you feel that your anxiety is still overwhelming, you can seek out support in a professional and non-judgmental manner from:

I don’t think it’s weird for you to feel judged by your parents given how they’re one of your main support systems, but I guess the distress you have doesn’t get resolved after speaking to them. Perhaps you going blank is your mind’s way of responding to a situation where you feel there’s no difference to opening up or not. So perhaps if you feel acknowledged and heard, you could be more comfortable to share the thoughts in your mind, and having people you can check-in with or look out for you.

Hi,
I want to thank you for reaching out to me @cottonsoul.
I am aware every relationship has ups and downs. Just lately maybe say since a month so many
issues have been on the rise. I feel very sad about why such problems exist.
I tried to go to counselling but I was financially tight.
I wanted to get help. Eventually, I did go and the person just said to leave this relationship.
That was not what I was looking for. I am looking for strategies on how to improve my communcation so that it will not trigger any problems.
I do have adults I can speak to but they are just judgemental and will tell me if the relationship is not working out then leave it. Everyone in this world does not start any relationship with the intention to leave one day. There will be problems but how you face them and get better is far more important. I write journals when I am upset or very happy. But writing has also not given any solution. I feel sad as my reactions are the cause of our arguments. Even if I get angry or don’t they are still an issue.
I will maybe say the scenario that happened recently. I feel alone as to why things keep happening this way and I am not being able to be happy. We were a happy couple until a month ago when my bf got new friends in TikTok.
He has introduced them to me and I am ok and even encouraged him to talk to them. His rationale for getting friends is his parents are aging, and his family is not close to the relatives. So if anything happens, he has his friends. I truly appreciate and support the idea.
I just noticed that one of his friends (a girl) who is a divorcee with 3 kids, always calling him and talking to him. I felt she was taking away all our private time together. He was also constantly chatting with her and telling her about his day-to-day activities. Initially, everything is ok but as time went by I felt he was more focused on the phone than on my conversations.
I felt alone and I confronted him and he got angry, he said I did not like him having friends and that is why I was reacting as such. Small arguments kept coming up but we resolved. Then a major argument happened in his parent’s house. I thought that this was the end of the relationship. The main issue for the argument, he is able to talk to his colleagues and his old and new friends properly. When I asked anything in general, he either snapped or got angry and when I confronted that emotion it got worse. I tried to remain calm but it did not help. He said I was angry about everything and I needed to work on my anger.
I agree and acknowledge that I get triggered easily but I am willing to work on it.
I do not know why he is not able to see his side of the mistake and when I pinpoint it he gets very angry.
I do admit I feel left out and jealous when he talks to her. I know for sure and completely trust him 100% he is not cheating on me. Is just that when someone else besides me is receiving more attention than me, I fear losing him and the relationship. I do trust him. I know him as a friend and then we started the relationship. I am not sure why I feel the way I feel. Sometimes all these thoughts make me feel I have a mental issue.
Another friend (a girl) bought him a watch, I was supposed to buy him that and I got so angry and pissed once again. Then we argued. He does not understand how I feel about this.
He only sees that I get angry but does not understand why. All these little things will cause problems in a relationship. Why are we getting someone a gift when it is not their birthday and they only know him for a month! These questions linger deep in my heart and keep me awake at night. After so much thinking I begin to cry then I take annrex to sleep. I know this habit is unhealthy.
I still do not understand why as a gf I am not allowed to get jealous and why hearing this he gets angry. Every attempt to talk sometimes fails miserably. That is why i wrote in my post I do not know what is wrong and how to solve this.
For now, I am trying to let go, I told him to not share so much with his friends as these can be potential future problems. I want to be the only girlfriend buying him things besides his parents and siblings and his children. Is that intention of mine wrong as we argue mostly about this! He says I am not accepting but I feel this is against my principles.
I hope to hear from you and maybe your view can also make me better understand myself.

I’m encouraged by your willingness.
I’m also so sorry to hear that your previous counseling experience did not provide the guidance you were seeking. I hear that you are looking for strategies to improve communication and foster a healthier connection with your partner and I can see that you are facing an and emotionally challenging situation within your relationship. The feelings of sadness, loneliness, and the struggle with communication are undoubtedly difficult to hold, and I completely empathise with your feelings.
Having feelings of jealousy and inadequacy in a relationship can be intricate, and I want you to know and recognize that your emotions are 100% valid, and exploring the roots of these feelings can help you to understand yourself better.
Perhaps you could bring up this topic to your therapist and discuss the deeper issues on the feelings of jealousy or inadequacy, and you could also discuss ways to help your partner understand and empathise with you better too?
You could also try this conversation tool that might be helpful for you when bringing up these topics to your partner. When you go through this tool, I hope it equips you with more confidence to discuss your feelings with your partner too.
Now, let’s try to process further:
2. How can you and your partner work together to establish healthy boundaries with friends while maintaining open communication and understanding?
3. In what ways can you both express and validate each other’s feelings, developing a more empathetic and supportive connection?
Let’s continue to process this and hopefully help you to get the courage to work on these issues with your partner directly too! Please also do continue to speak to your therapist so that you have a clearer idea on the strategies you can use to improve your communication with your partner.

Thank you very much for reaching out. I tried all possible suggestions and mostly the age group they support is less than 25 years old.
It is ok. I think for now i just share here. I am trying my best to be open minded. Somehow it is not working out best for me.
Thank you for the strategies. At this current time whatever i say…all my words are a issue. Everything from my mouth seems to be a issue. Just have zero motivation to carry on to do anything. I am just going to keep quiet. Hoping when i keep quiet problems will not arise much.
I do not know whenever i try to talk about problems or ask what is wrong, the problem becomes bigger.
I do not think at this time is the best to validate the feelings. It is of no use as well.
We just spoke about it yesterday and today another issue happened. I am not sure where the mistake is. I am having a heavy heart. He does not like collar t -shirts. Then suddenly he wanted to buy one. I just asked why this change and he says my questioning technique is wrong. I do not know what i did wrong. When i tried to speak about it he just got angry.
I have fear and i have acknowledged that. But sadly not knowing how to solve this. This last month november and december just having problems after problems.
Every time i try to talk he gets angry.
I am just sad why my situation has been in such a state. I managed to be with him after so many ups and downs. Everything was going well till recently. I am just very tired and mostly feel lonely. Sometimes being silent is the best option.
Sometimes i do not know why i cry. I feel sad but no solution to my problem.
In this platform i can share how I feel. For now i can manage with it. Sometimes I wish I had a sibling or good friend. I have a good friend, but she will say just drop all these. If every relationship we drop and go then noone will be with anyone.
I am not close to my family. I do not talk to my parents and so having my own family matters alot for me. Now at this point i do not know if we will marry. So much of fear in me. Everytime we solve the problem we argue for another. What has happened that there is so much hatred i begin to wonder.

I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. I can see that you’re going through a difficult time, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling tired, lonely, and overwhelmed.
It takes a lot of courage to express your feelings, and I appreciate you sharing your struggles with me. I’m really glad to see that you’ve been making an effort to communicate and understand the dynamics in your relationship. Yes, it is really common for relationships to face difficulties, and the emotional toll can be quite heavy.
I can imagine how feeling unheard or misunderstood can be very distressing. I want to acknowledge the weight of your experiences and the impact they’re having on your well-being. - they are all valid and very real. It’s okay to feel unsure about the future and to recognize your fears. Sometimes, having someone objective to talk to can make a huge difference.

Sorry for the late reply. I mean the baseline of everything seems to be my anger. I have anger issues but i have changed myself over the years.
Somehow as they were not part of my life previously they feel that now my anger is alot. I can only make and change myself. But if constantly i am being picked on then nth can be done.
I have even worked out my reasons for my anger:
2. When I explain something and is not even heard upon.
3. When i have made prior arrangements then last minute without explaining there are changes.
4. When getting feedback from adult the feeback is only given as i have anger management issues. Then what about my bf, he does not get angry?
5. When my intuition says someone has bad intentions you do not move away something terrible happens.
6. Talking abt how alone i am without my family and how i do not know how to respect elders or bond in a family.
If i do not how to respect the elders my bf family would not have accepted me.
For now not much of strategies in hand.
2. Pray
3. Meditate
4. Keep quiet mostly to avoid problems
5. Not go over often
6. Exercise (×2 times a week)
7. Explain less
Anyone can explain but i feel better to step back and have more room and time for myself. My strategies might not solve my issues but yes i know i do know i do not create any problems.
I wanted to sit on sunday and talk things out. Sometimes the behaviour displayed makes me feel should i even try? I am scared as i do not want the issue to go bigger. I had to kind of force him to talk. He did not want it.
Simple incident like saving money and not taking grab. I mean i have explained myself. When i explain i feel like low, even though is a good option. This is a want and not a need.

Sorry for the late reply. Firstly i was away on the trip. The trip had some issues as well but when we came back we sorted them out. We were happy that we spoke out how we feel and set boundaries.
There were problems again due to his friend, the lady who had bought him a watch and perfume previously. She was unable and i texted her to check how she was. She replies my bf but not me. So when i raise this with my bf he says i am over reacting. He is failing to understand a point these ppl are creating issues in a relationship.
I tried in many ways to explain but i was not able to get through. He has to self realise himself that this is a bad friendship. It might be or it might not be. I am unsure of it. My gut says this is not.
Sometimes we can tell someone something is not right but they have to figure it out. Currently i am not able to make my bf understand this so i need to let it off. I am working on by day basis now. I previously suggested strategies to help my relationship.
I feel i need to heal from incidents. I need to fogive and forget. Let go of what is unwanted in me. Without healing i cannot and will not be able to handle anything right.
I want to take time to heal and let go of all the bad things that happened to me.
2. Past relationships
3. Childhood unsettled feelings
4. Unsettled feelings from previous relationships
Anyway it is 2024 already and i wrote my reply half way and i stopped. Both ladies who were talking to him have stopped. I was focusing my 2 months on work as i am a mentor to a person at work.
Lately even though no other characters are in the story a fight broke out again. He has so much of anger. I am not sure where my relationship stands. I still want it but i am not able to understand why i feel so hurt.
When we say certain things are not good, why they are not able to see it. A friend recommend to me this technique on top of what i am trying to do. She mentioned to just show love and do not advise, do not instruct. Just love and focus on my myself. I am not sure but willing to try. I personally feel very broken maybe as i come up with so much strategies and why i am always misunderstood for everything.
It hurts but i focus on my work. I use the fact i have work to just do work and not ineterfere much in anything. I am letting go on my way. I am not aure if it is even correct.
I put all problems in a bag and have diverted the focus to me. I need to settle a few things.
2. House renovations
3. Save for the items to be purchased for the house
4. House warming ceremony and moving in
5. Build up my savings
6. Save to get married ( i am not sure if he feels the same way)
I am very attached to everything. Now i am trying to be just quiet. I do not feel like talking. I also do not want to upset anyone around me as well. My goals are spelled out and just hoping to achieve them.
Tomorrow is valentine’s day and i do not feel it. I have questions like why are we always fighting? Are we meant for each other? Just sad.

I’m sorry to hear that you’re going through a challenging time in your relationship. It’s important to prioritize open and honest communication with your boyfriend. Consider expressing your feelings and concerns calmly, using “I” statements to avoid blame. Actively listen to his perspective as well. I know you were financially tight and the previous counsellor unable to help your situation, but consider to find a trusted mutual friend who can talk in a neutral ground to understand your boyfriend’s point of view as well.
On the other hand, managing stress from house renovations, savings, and future plans can be overwhelming. Break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps, and communicate openly with your boyfriend about shared responsibilities.

8237,i’m terrified.,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/im-terrified/8237,Coping,---,5810,plvto,User,,11835,1,"so my parents smoke a lot but my dad has been worse off with his health for a long time. he has asthma and he used to drink a lot so it’s not really a surprise that the effects of his past issues with alcohol combined with the heavy smoking is causing him health problems that seems to have gotten worse.
his coughs genuinely scare me and he’s started audibly wheezing too and now i’m so so worried that he might have lung cancer or some fatal health problem. to make matters worse, each time i visit my family doctor, he asks me to ask my dad to get a lung checkup to make sure everything is okay but every time i tell me dad that he pretends everything is okay and brushes me off or he gets angry at me. he’s put it off for so long but only now has he actually looked for a lung specialist to get checked.
i’m so scared that it might be too late by then or he’ll get angry at the doctor for her diagnosis or treatment plans and try to brush her off too. i’m so so scared that i might lose him. i don’t have the best relationship with either of my parents but between the two, my relationship with him was better so i’m really really afraid of losing him. i’m not sure what i would do with myself if that happens.
i’ve also realised that i’m subconsiously preparing for the worst? like since he’s the sole breadwinner of our household, i’ve started stocking up on items just in case (i unknowingly blew $230 today and that worsened ny anxiety of being a burden on my family financially) or i’ve started distancing myself. the whole distancing and isolating part is so contradictory but i think i do that just so i can stop the constant anxiety of losing someone that has such a big impact on my life. i’m 17 going on 18 and my mom is quite emotionally unstable as it is, without my dad around she’s more likely to have episodes and i don’t know how i’m going to be able to manage without him both emotionally and physically.

Thank you for sharing your worries with us, I hear you and it sounds like you’re carrying a tremendous weight on your shoulders, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared in this situation. Watching a loved one struggle with their health can be incredibly distressing, especially when it feels like they’re not taking the steps needed to address it.
Your concern for your dad’s health is palpable, and it’s clear that you care deeply for him It’s natural to feel a mix of emotions, including fear, frustration, and helplessness, when faced with the possibility of losing someone important to you. The fact that you’re also considering the practical implications, such as the financial impact and the potential emotional strain on your mom, shows a great deal of maturity and responsibility on your part.
It’s important to recognize that while you want to support your dad and your family, you also need to take care of yourself. It’s okay to feel anxious and to struggle with the uncertainty of the situation. You’re doing the best you can with the tools you have, and it’s important to acknowledge that.
I was wondering if you would like to try out these 2 suggestions:
2. While it’s challenging when your dad brushes off your concerns, it’s important to keep trying to communicate with him about his health in a compassionate and non-confrontational manner. You could let him know how much you care about him and how his health impacts you. Set boundaries around discussions about his health to avoid conflict, but also make it clear that you’re there to support him when he’s ready to address it
3. Try to focus on what you can control It’s natural to feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty of your dad’s health and its potential impact on your family. However, try to focus on what you can control in the present moment. This might include taking care of your own physical and emotional well-being, staying on top of your schoolwork, and finding healthy ways to cope with stress. By focusing on the things you can control, you can regain a sense of agency and reduce feelings of helplessness.
Remember, you’re not alone in this! It’s okay to ask for help! I would also encourage you to speak to a counsellor or someone whom you trust about this issue, so that you can receive the support that you need in this time.

Thank you for sharing with us your worries, I hear you and I’m really sorry to hear that you’ve been struggling with intrusive thoughts like this. It sounds incredibly distressing and exhausting to have to battle against them, especially when you have so much on your plate already. It’s understandable that with your busy schedule and lack of sleep, you might be feeling overwhelmed and finding it harder to manage these thoughts.
There can definitely be a link between intrusive thoughts and stress, lack of sleep, and overwhelming schedules. When we’re feeling overwhelmed or exhausted, our minds can become more susceptible to intrusive or negative thoughts. It’s like our brain’s way of trying to process everything we’re dealing with, but sometimes it can manifest in unhelpful ways.
It’s important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, especially during times like these. Finding ways to manage your stress and improve your sleep schedule could potentially help alleviate some of the intensity of these intrusive thoughts.
Are there any strategies you’ve tried in the past that have helped you cope with stress or improve your sleep? It might be worth exploring those options again or seeking support from a trusted adult or mental health professional who can provide support too. It might be helpful to seek the support of your school counsellor and perhaps get more ideas and strategies on how to manage each of those components (e.g. sleep, stress) better.

I know I might be depressed. I know I need to seek help, but sometimes I feel like, what’s the point? Speaking out about how I feel, things will still be the same, nothing will change. I just have to resign to my fate.
I’m tired, feeling overwhelmed, feeling empty, feeling hopeless, feeling like life has come to a stop when it’s still moving.
It feels like my life has come to an end when I’m still breathing, still healthy. I don’t know why I’m feeling this way.
I hate my life so much. I have always felt this way since I was young. I didn’t have a good childhood and struggled a lot, going through so much that a child shouldn’t have gone through. So since I was young, my wish was to be happily married and have my own family.
Years later, yes, I’m married, but am I happy? It feels like maybe this married life is even worse than my childhood days. Even though I’m better off now and can eat whatever I want and do not have financial issues as of now, I’m struggling with my child who has special needs.
I thought having a special needs child would change me, like how all parents become resilient, yet no. I’m becoming worse. I feel like I’m a bad parent; my temper and patience become worse. I regret having a child, I regret getting married.
I tried to avoid social media because seeing my peers having a happy family with happy, normal kids makes me grieve even more.
I dislike my life even more now, like it’s a never-ending struggle. I have thought of ending my life many times since I was young. I hate myself for being weak. But what can I do? I’m dragging myself every single day. I don’t feel like mingling with anyone else anymore because I feel like we are very different now. I feel like I’m a burden to my husband for giving birth to a special needs child, like I have destroyed his life as well.
I feel so wrong even typing all these, but honestly, I feel this way. I lose motivation in everything. Even at work, I get agitated with the job that I used to have passion for.
It feels like I shouldn’t even exist in this world. If suffering is all that I will be experiencing, what’s the point? Sometimes I Google to try to make myself be positive, but only to fall deeper into this black hole of hopelessness. I guess it was all because of the issues I have been facing since young which got snowball and unresolved",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your concerns, I hear you and it sounds like you’re going through a really tough time right now, and it’s completely understandable why you’re feeling so overwhelmed and conflicted. I want to commend you for your courage in reaching out about this issue, as you grapple with such complex emotions.
Sometimes, our relationships can be very challenging, especially when feelings change or become uncertain. I can see that you deeply care about this person and value the connection you share with them. The fact that you’re seeking clarity and understanding speaks volumes about your sincerity and commitment to finding a solution to this.
Feeling guilty about unintentionally causing distress to someone you care about is a heavy burden to carry, but it’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this. Relationships often require open and honest communication, even when it’s difficult. While it may feel overwhelming right now, taking small steps towards understanding your own feelings and finding the right words to express them can ultimately bring clarity and relief to both you and your friend.
It might be helpful to take some time for self-reflection For example, take some time each day to write down your thoughts and feelings about the situation. This can help you clarify your emotions and gain insight into what you’re truly experiencing. Sometimes, writing can be a cathartic way to process your thoughts and untangle complex feelings You can also consider jotting down specific moments or interactions with your friend that stand out to you, as well as any patterns or recurring thoughts you notice. Reflecting on your journal entries over time may reveal patterns or insights that can guide your understanding of your feelings.
Additionally, having an open and compassionate conversation with your friend about where you’re at emotionally can provide an opportunity for mutual understanding and support. You can also consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in relationships. A trained professional can offer a supportive and non-judgmental space for you to explore your feelings and concerns, and help you gain clarity about your emotions. From there, you can also make informed decisions about how to move forward in a way that aligns with your values and goals.
Last but not least, I encourage you to be kind to yourself throughout this process! It’s okay to feel uncertain, and it’s okay to seek support as you work through these emotions. You’re doing the best you can, and that’s truly admirable.

Its bad enough that i am already diagnosed with mental illness however it doesnt help that I am talking to myself during these Live sessions.
I have recently logged out of social media and its like a detox actually. Usually the first thing i do is check social media and initially i thought just 10 minutes but it will drag out to hours so its a good thing.
Nowadays, i occupy my time with talking to friends or chatting with them on Whats app or sms or calls and I do busking for the fun of it these day cause there was periods where i only got 2 dollars after singing my heart out for 3 hours. So i dont take any of the music i make seriously anymore. Afterall, its just a songs at the end of the day.
I have been going to the gym about 2-3 times a week and my body is aching as we speak but its a good kind of aching.
Some days i get triggered and start thinking of what might have happen if i did things differently. However, just to share, We are where we are suppose to be and like for the gym, eventhough i just started out again, i do start with experience.
I Guess what i am trying to say here is that getting thru the days, be some good, be some bad and be some like "" What was that ??""…This is what life is all about.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and feelings with us. I’m hearing that you’ve been navigating through a range of experiences, and I truly appreciate your openness in sharing your journey! Taking steps such as logging out of social media for a detox can indeed be a significant move towards prioritising your mental well-being. I’m heartened to hear that you’ve found alternative ways to spend your time, whether it’s connecting with friends or pursuing activities like busking and going to the gym.
Life is indeed filled with a mix of moments, and your perspective on embracing the variety of experiences that life may bring is insightful. It’s normal to have moments of reflection and wonder about different paths, but your acknowledgment that we are where we are supposed to be is a valuable mindset to have.
The fact that you’re engaging in activities like gym sessions, even if they lead to aching muscles, tells me that you’re committed to practising self-care. Remember that every step, even those that might seem small or uncertain, contributes to your overall growth and well-being.
If you find that certain triggers are impacting your thoughts, it might be helpful to explore these feelings further, perhaps with the support of a mental health professional. They can provide additional tools and strategies to help you navigate through challenging moments and enhance your coping skills. Alternatively, if you’re comfortable, you could also share them with our community - we’re all in this journey called life together.
Lastly, I’d like to commend you on your attitude towards making the most of each day, even with its ups and downs! Life is a journey, and it’s about finding meaning and joy in the process.

Life’s unpredictability is acknowledged, and your ability to navigate through its ups and downs with a positive outlook is commendable.

Thank you for sharing with us your worries, I hear you and I assure you it’s completely understandable to feel a mix of emotions at this stage in life. Feeling isolated at home while finding fulfillment in part-time work and friendships is a common experience, especially as we grow older and our social circles may change. Your feelings are valid and seeking happiness and connection outside the home is a healthy way to cope with isolation
Regarding alcohol, it’s actually common for people to enjoy a drink at home as a way to relax and unwind, especially after a long day! However, it’s also important to be mindful of how alcohol consumption may affect your overall well-being and relationships. I can imagine that you might feel frustrated or dismissed if your spouse is imposing her negativity on your alcohol habits. Perhaps open and honest communication about boundaries and concerns can help bridge any gaps in understanding.
For example, you could schedule a time to have a calm and honest conversation with your spouse about your feelings and concerns regarding alcohol and their perception of it. Express your thoughts and emotions openly, and encourage your spouse to do the same. Listen actively to each other’s perspectives without judgment, and try to understand where each of you is coming from. This can help you both to have empathy and mutual respect for each other, and may lead to finding common ground or compromises that work for both of you.
I also want to encourage you to consider exploring alternative ways to cope with feelings of isolation and stress that don’t involve alcohol. Engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, such as hobbies, exercise, volunteering, or spending quality time with friends and loved ones! Exploring new interests or reconnecting with old passions can help enrich your life and provide alternative sources of happiness and relaxation.
Last but not least, you could also try seeking support from a therapist or counselor to teach you new coping strategies for managing stress and improving communication within your relationship You could walk in to the nearest Family Service Centre (click on the link to see which is nearest to your home) or talk to a mental health professional online here:

The decision to move out of the master bedroom to minimize interaction is a coping mechanism that people sometimes employ in difficult relationships. However, it’s crucial to address the underlying issues causing this distance.
If your therapist has suggested involving your spouse in the therapy sessions and your spouse has not responded, it’s important to approach the situation with sensitivity and open communication.

It’s a really complicated feeling. For example, i’d like to learn some tiktok dances so I can record a tiktok or two with my girlfriend, but i can’t. I want it and when she’s doing it, it looks nice and like a fun thing to do ( same with other people ) but whenever, in my imagination, i put myself into their place, dancing, suddenly it feels disgusting and i repel it. It creates a dissonance in me, i so badly want it so my gf can be happy but on the other end i feel so disgusted.
Yea… This feeling occurs with many things, but mostly with modern and feminine things, like make up ( i dont necessarily need to want to do the thing im disgusted by ), tiktok dances, singing. And i know some of them are not feminine but in my eyes they are.
i also can’t accept happinness, whenever i get a present from my girlfriend i love it but some voice in me wants to throw it away, or sometimes i have this thought that it would be more peaceful if i would break up with her even tho i know it wouldnt, i would just drown in sadness ( i mean in some way that is a little bit more peaceful, i live a stressful live and not an easy one so i find comfort in sadness and depression ). Idk, maybe it has something to do with that.

Is it because you feel like you don’t deserve her / happiness in your life that’s why you want to throw away her presents so you won’t get disappointed in future? And then you imagine yourself living in sadness but you feel peaceful because that’s something you’d have “control” over?
Definitely a very complex feeling to deal with. I can imagine how you want to make your girlfriend happy but yet at the same time feel disgusted over the things she wanna do. Actually, is she okay with you not doing what she likes? I guess everyone is different and you probably have other ways to show your love for her instead of forcing yourself to dance.", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/disgusted-by-new-things/8232/1,0,,11827,,,11827

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles. I hear how the dissonance in your mind is making you upset but at the same time it kinda makes sense to you - I want you to know that what you’re feeling and thinking is valid, given your situation.
I’m curious to know if you noticed when this kinda started for you? It is something more recent, or has been going on awhile for you? This experience of yours or cognitive dissonance (where two or more thoughts/beliefs/urges contradict each other) perhaps is a response to not wanting the ‘inconsistencies’ (e.g., want happiness but don’t think deserve it, etc.) but you’re stuck in figuring out how to reconcile those contradictions in your mind…
I wonder if those feelings you get like depressed mood and disgust is trying to send you another message, kinda like:
- Sadness signals loss of something valuable or disappointment towards yourself/others
- Disgust signals something to avoid or to check your boundaries
So maybe the dissonance can be seen as an opportunity to reflect on your thoughts (like has there been a ‘loss’ or need to ‘avoid’?) to be more in line with reality - what you actually need/want in a relationship or to be more consistent with what you value (perhaps connection, contentment, etc.). This means changing to better match the person you want to be. Of course, this doesn’t happen overnight and it will probably still be distressing as you go through it but perhaps you can try some of these activities to see if it helps with the discomfort:
• Being mindful
• Being kind to yourself
• Shifting (to a more helpful) perspective
Also, I wonder if you have the chance to speak about this with someone else? If not with your girlfriend, perhaps your school counsellor? Or someone else you feel comfortable with and can trust. In the meantime, hope this clears up some of your questions and looking forward to hearing from you again!

Yes, i think it’s mostly because of that, but it shows in a strange way, through disgust and not through sadness, or guilt. I just feel disgusted by her present even tho if i think about it, it’s one of the best presents i’ve ever received.
Kind of. I mean i do find comfort and peace in sadness but i don’t really think i have control over it. I don’t feel like anything is under control when i’m sad but i’m more willing to accept it, the order of things, my fate or whatever we’re talking about.

That’s really sweet, @anonymous138. I get where you’re coming from because I’ve walked the same path (to some extent too).
I think you need to ask yourself which is more important - being able to feel like you can do what your girlfriend likes or just being comfortable in your own feelings (in this case, sadness).
Actually it all boils down to you - which makes you feel better then just do it. If you go deeper, actually it’s not about your girlfriend anymore. It’s about you and your own desires. It sounds harsh but actually it’s just the way of life and maybe not that much talked about in the society. And it’s not a negative thing to prioritise your own needs.
Also I guess think about sustainability. Will you feel burn out after a while if you keep doing things you don’t like? Or do you have the resolve to do that for the rest of your life (assuming you intend to have a long term relationship with your girlfriend)

Thanks for finding the courage to share about your struggles here. It must’ve not been an easy thing to open up so I commend you for that! I also want to let you know that what you think and feel about what you’re currently going through is valid – I can see where you’re coming from, hearing about your past experiences and your worries about how your life is shaping.
You have quite the self-awareness and though you mostly see flaws with your situation, I hope you can also see it with some self-compassion. Although you can’t change what had happened, you can change the way you think and feel about the past by being kinder to yourself. I also wonder about the fears you faced when opportunities presented itself to you – it sounded as though the benefit of not doing (and not failing) outweighed the gains from taking the opportunity. I wonder if not doing was connected to not needing to go through uncertainty and very likely real difficulties (to do with finances, skills, knowledge, etc.). I imagine feeling fearful being in that situation and just wanting to reduce that distress where the pros of not doing seem to outweigh the pros of doing.
What’s different now is you having the choice to live the life you want to. This is definitely going to be scary time but can also be an exciting time as you have the opportunity to start on something very fulfilling – working on yourself! Using your self awareness, you can discover what truly matters by asking yourself about what you really value. There’s this concept of ikigai that can help you discover further by asking yourself what you enjoy, what you’re good at, and to strive for that which brings value and joy to your life!
Next, you can build momentum to help you live life in accordance to being who you want to be - cultivate taking action, small but meaningful ones, as action leads to more action, which builds momentum! If we’re too caught up with the finish line, we forget the joy we experience on the journey to get there.
I commend you on wanting to work on yourself. Remember that you also deserve and can get the necessary support you need!

It’s important to recognize that everyone’s journey is unique, and there’s no fixed timeline for success. First, try not to be too hard on yourself. Reflect on your strengths, interests, and what truly makes you passionate.
Consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself. Break down your aspirations into manageable steps, and celebrate each accomplishment, no matter how small. Networking and reaching out to people in industries you’re interested in can also open up potential opportunities. Don’t hesitate to explore skill-building courses or volunteering, as these experiences can help build confidence and enhance your resume.
Remember, it’s never too late to start working towards your goals. Be persistent, stay positive, and keep an open mind as you navigate through the challenges.

I often find that when I am angry, I never respond aggresively but instead become silent and sulky for a prolonged period of time.

Thank you for sharing about your struggles with being angry - I want to share that what you think and feel given your situation is valid. It does sound very disheartening when your feelings are trivialised, as though you weren’t heard at all. And I can see that you want to overcome your anger but it’s proving to be more difficult because of that.
We get mad and angry as it’s a signal that we’ve been treated unfairly, there’s a violation towards us, and/or things are not in line with what you value. Also, anger can be expressed on a continuum (from mild irritation to intense fury!) and can be implicit (not directly expressed) or explicit. So, your anger expression is unique to you and perhaps it is not the typical way that people expect to see - this dissonance in what they expect and see in reality causes them to come up with reasons to explain the mismatch…
I wonder what sort of situations make you feel angry in this manner? Does this happen with everyone or with certain people? I’m curious if you’ve noticed any patterns? You mentioned “get over the hurt” and you’re right that anger is a signal that we’ve been hurt, or that something might’ve been taken away or not met… I wonder what that might be for you?
I think that you have more to share and I’m more than willing to listen if you’re up to share. Remember that you deserve and can get the necessary support you need. Till then, take care!",,0,,,,,

2. Express yourself: Communicate your feelings calmly and assertively.
3. Practice mindfulness: Stay present and breathe deeply to manage intense emotions.
4. Identify triggers: Recognize patterns or situations that trigger your hurt feelings.
5. Seek compromise: Work towards finding solutions and compromises rather than dwelling on the issue.
6. Consider professional help: If needed, consult with a therapist for guidance on managing emotions and improving communication.

Thank you for sharing all your worries and stresses with us. I hear you, and it sounds like you’ve been experiencing vivid and immersive daydreaming episodes for a significant portion of your life. It’s not uncommon for people to have rich inner worlds and elaborate fantasies, especially during periods of solitude or relaxation, like at night before sleeping. Many people find comfort, entertainment, and a sense of fulfillment in daydreaming
However, when daydreaming starts to interfere with daily activities, relationships, or overall well-being, it’s important for us to take a closer look and perhaps seek support. Your realization that you’re upset when anything interrupts your daydreaming, or that you’re choosing it over socializing with friends, indicates that it might be impacting your life in ways you hadn’t previously recognized.
Feeling like you’re “crazy” is a common reaction when something about our behavior feels outside the norm or difficult to control. But rest assured, experiencing intense daydreaming doesn’t make you crazy. It’s just a part of your unique way of processing thoughts and emotions
It might be helpful to reflect on why you’re drawn to daydreaming to such an extent and explore if there are underlying feelings or needs that your daydreams are fulfilling. One of the ways to process this is to try talking to a therapist or counsellor It can be a helpful step in understanding your experiences better and finding ways to manage them if they’re causing distress or interfering with your life goals.

Thank you for sharing your stress and struggles with us, I’m truly sorry to hear about the passing of your brother and the difficult situation you’re facing. Losing a loved one is already very challenging, and the added stress of legal matters can make it even more overwhelming. It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden, and I want you to know that your feelings are completely valid.
It’s understandable that you’re feeling stressed, tired, and sick of the entire situation. Dealing with legal matters after a loss is never easy, especially when there are complications involved. I can see that you cared for his well being very much as you carry this regret about not being able to convince your brother to make a will. I want to acknowledge that your situation is indeed difficult and complex, and it’s okay to feel tired and frustrated and at a loss.
I also want to share that it’s likely also a process of grieving for you. Grieving is a unique and personal process, and there is no right or wrong way to work around it. If you find it helpful, do consider reaching out to friends, family, or a support group to share your thoughts and emotions. I also encourage you to speak to a professional counsellor to help you to process this whole situation carefully and with the neutral perspective of a mental health professional. It might be beneficial to seek professional advice from an expert also, to better understand your options and responsibilities regarding your brother’s estate.
In the midst of these difficulties, please remember to take care of yourself. Additionally, if you’re open to it, engaging in activities that bring comfort and solace could contribute to your overall well-being during this challenging time.
If you need someone to talk to or share your feelings, we are here for you too. Please let us know how you’re coping, we’d love to support you further.",,2,,11401,,11401.0,

I’m deeply sorry for your loss and for the additional stress and burden you’re experiencing during this difficult time. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and distressed, especially when faced with unexpected circumstances like your brother’s passing and the subsequent legal matters.
Since your appointment with a mental health doctor at the Polyclinic isn’t until April, it’s important to explore other options for assistance.
There are several avenues you can explore to access therapy or psychiatric services, even with limited resources:
2. Family Service Centre: You can walk in or call a nearby Family Service Centre that offer counseling and psychiatric services on a sliding scale fee basis or sometimes even for free. These centers often have professionals who specialize in grief counseling and can provide the support you need during this challenging time. You can find a centre near your home from here: MSF | Directories
3. Online Counseling Services: There are online platforms that offer therapy and counseling services through video calls or messaging. Some of these platforms have options for reduced fees or financial assistance based on need. While they may not offer the same level of support as in-person therapy, they can still provide valuable support and assistance during this time. You can try out either one of these options:
- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
- ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
Please also look through this comprehensive list of providers according to location. There are GPs, and polyclinics that provide mental health assessment and support too.
Click here - https://www.aic.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Mind-Matters-Resource-Directory-Listings.pdf

7233,Friendships,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/friendships/7233,Seeking Help,---,5828,Mentalhealth60,User,,10242,1,"For context I was emotionally neglected as a child, my mother battled with depression and as a result I was not socialized properly during my toddler and infant years.
During my teens years, I missed the golden period to make genuine friendships due to my mental health struggles, I lacked the social skills and the necessary support from my school. I wanted to commit suicide and dealt with self harm during secondary school. People at school thought I was attention seeking. My school counsellor was afraid of me because of my diagnosis and did not provide the necessary support and care I should have received. Due to my poor social skills and lack of exposure to socializing, I had no friends to rely and support on during my secondary school days.
I always find it hard to be happy in social situations, I do talk to people and join social events but they never really resulted in friendships but only acquaintances. I am better mentally now as compared to my secondary school days, the trauma of social rejection and emotional baggage I still carry with me. I think my social needs are not fully satisfied and I am going out of my comfort zone to meet new people. People are cordial with me but I get very upset when my efforts for friendship arent reciprocated equally.
I want to ask how can I deal with feeling sad and disappointment in social situations, its very discouraging to deal with setbacks like this. Sometimes I feel discouraged and unhappy to join social events or even mingle around with people because of the hurt I have been through. It feels like I am trapped in this cycle of feeling hurt, trying and being disappointed.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us your feelings, I’m truly sorry to hear about the challenges you’ve faced, and I want to encourage you that you’ve actually demonstrated incredible resilience in overcoming those obstacles. Dealing with feelings of sadness and disappointment in social situations can be very hard, but there are strategies that might help you work through these emotions:
2. Practice Self-Compassion: Remind yourself that healing from past experiences takes time, and it’s okay to have moments of sadness or disappointment. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend going through a similar situation.
3. Set Realistic Expectations: It’s important to have realistic expectations in social situations. Building meaningful connections takes time, and not every interaction will lead to deep friendships. Allow relationships to develop naturally without putting too much pressure on yourself or others.
4. Focus on the Positive: Instead of dwelling on disappointments, try to shift your focus to the positive aspects of your social interactions. Acknowledge small victories, even if they’re just moments of connection or shared laughter. Celebrate the progress you make, no matter how small.
5. Seek Support: Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can provide support and guidance as you navigate these challenges. Having a safe space to discuss your feelings and experiences can be helpful in the healing process. You could try reaching out to the nearest Family Service Centre and speak to a mental health professional.
6. Set Boundaries: It’s okay to set boundaries and take breaks from social situations when needed. Pay attention to your own emotional well-being and prioritize self-care. Taking time for yourself doesn’t mean giving up on socializing—it means ensuring you engage in a way that is healthy for you.
Remember that healing is a gradual process, and it’s okay to seek professional support along the way. You’ve shown tremendous strength in your journey so far, and I hope that as you continue to explore social connections, you’ll find the meaningful relationships you deserve.

Thanks for the info. Unfortunately, no once you are not a student the school does not provide counselling services anymore. I did find that there was some improvement in terms of my social skills but I still found it difficult to connect with others(still learning), due to long years of isolation in my teenage years.
I had some friends in my poly/uni days but after the class ended, the friendship ended as well(classified as friendship of convenience in this case), and they had other friends to hangout with so I was less of a priority to them.",,2,,,,,

I went to a talk a few weeks ago and they discussed about how people were happier in the 80s and 90s as life was more simple back then, people were more connected and the kampong spirit was there, the speaker went on to explain that currently we feel more unhappy in this era because we are more disconnected from one another.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for coming on and sharing about your struggles. I can see how this is affecting you - whether or not it’s normal asian teenager stress, the impact it has on you and your confidence are real and valid.
You mention about not wanting to disappoint people and this anxiety which was originally supposed to protect you (by preparing you in anticipation of difficult situations) has led you to avoid situations where you think you will be ‘targeted’. Given your previous experience in secondary school, I think that it makes sense that you’re reacting this way. This avoidance is further fueled by thoughts of what-if and we might doubt ourselves/abilities even more…
I can see how you’re reaching out for assistance and I want to commend your self-awareness on this matter! Have you tried speaking to someone about this? Perhaps a person you feel safe with and can trust - maybe your school counsellor? I get what you say about opening up to your mum, it would be very hard but I think that if you allow yourself to engage in open communication [consider using I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like to happen)], that will encourage listening on her end and maybe discussing ways to support you.
At the same time, you can build tolerance towards distress by identifying triggers or signs that cause you to think/worry more than usual, feeling scared, and/or body reacting more than usual and then engaging in calming down strategies like deep breathing and checking if you’re thoughts are accurate and helpful (maybe things like “Is it 100% accurate?”, “Does the other person know what I need?"", “Was I clear in saying what I needed?”). Also consider being more kind to yourself and engage in self-compassion.
Remember that you deserve and can get the support you need. Hope to hear from you soon, take care!",yourself https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=be_kind,1,,,,,

Thanks for sharing, @jane2. I can understand why you hesitate to talk to your mummy about this. Do you talk to her about other stuff besides school work? It’s normal if she can’t understand since your experience will probably be very different from how her schooling life was. But if she’s able to listen and offer some advice, maybe that’ll be helpful too.
I remember failing my first exam in secondary school. I was so scared of telling my parents because I’ve always done pretty well in primary school. Eventually I did tell them because I needed them to sign on my report book but they were pretty chill about it. So I guess it was okay??

Thanks for reaching out about your struggles. I wanna let you know what you’re feeling and going through is valid given what you went through. I also wanna let you know that your approach of getting better by doing the things you love is commendable too! You mentioned something that happened in the past, I wonder if you had the opportunity to have spoken about it before? I’m curious to know more if you’re willing to share too.
It sounds like something traumatising replays in your mind, like you’re kinda stuck in this state that you can’t forget those thoughts. Our brain is wired in a way that we remember negative events more saliently so that we can anticipate danger and respond to it to keep ourselves safe. It’s as if you’re viewing the actions of others through a darkened lens, perhaps not consciously. I also wonder if this plays into your actions of obsessing and pushing away people close to you? On one hand you want to be close and safe around people, and on another hand, people might be dangerous so you might keep them at a distance and won’t be hurt…
I can hear how your mood is currently affected, and it seems to be happening for quite some time. The signs you’re experiencing like feeling down, not motivated to do things, nightmares, anxious, thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore – do sound like those of someone with depressed mood .
In the meantime, I wonder if you’ve tried other ways to help you cope with your emotions? To at least build some tolerance to kinda buffer the effects before it gets too overwhelming, perhaps can try the below:
• Being mindful
• Being kind to yourself
• Shifting (to a more helpful) perspective
At the same time, you can also consider professional support from Family Service Centres as they also offer a safe space to process your emotions in a non-judgmental manner and to build ways to help you cope better.

yes, i did get to talk with people about my past but they also seem not to understand the situations i’ve been through. So, they could only listen and keep me company.
About my past, is a relationship i’ve had with a guy and i seem to mistaken the toxic relationship we had are love. He would treat me with so much kindness and affection, then he would try to manipulate my feelings so many times while i gave him the love that he deserves. I gave him chances all over again and he would try to hurt me back. At the same time, I found myself very attached to him and I feel like i’ve been enjoying the toxicity he’s been giving to me. Because it felt like he’s the only person i feel i can rely to and understand me the most.
However, i already left him last year and i seem to get better since we’re not talking anymore. he only kept appearing in my dreams which is annoying and it really ruined my mental health again because i remembered about him. also, about pushing people away, i seem to teach myself not to do it anymore because i know some people were also really kind and sincere to be with me.

If you’re willing, you can approach someone from the nearby Family Service Centre to help you with processing some of the issues

I hear you. It sounds like you’re going through a really tough time right now, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed by everything that’s going on. It takes a lot of courage to open up about what you’re going through, and I appreciate your honesty.
Feeling like everything is going downhill can be incredibly disheartening, and it’s totally normal to feel lost and unsure about how to move forward.

Thank you for sharing your frustrations and struggles with us, I hear you and I’m truly sorry for the hurtful and insensitive treatment you’re facing at work. It’s deeply unfair that your abilities and dedication are being overshadowed by assumptions about your health. It’s understandable that you feel frustrated and discouraged by the lack of encouragement and support from your colleagues.
Your recovery from a stroke is a testament to your strength and resilience, and it’s unfair for anyone to diminish your accomplishments because of it.
If you are open to it, here are two suggestions that might help improve your situation:
2. Document your achievements: Try to keep a record of your accomplishments since recovering from your stroke, such as successful classes taught, positive feedback from students or parents, and any additional responsibilities you’ve taken on. You could present this evidence to HR or your VP and it might help dispel their misconceptions about your capabilities.
3. Seek support: Please do consider reaching out to a higher authority within the organization, such as a supervisor or director, to address the unfair treatment you’re facing. They may be able to intervene on your behalf and ensure that you’re given the opportunities and respect you deserve.
Last but not least, please remember that you’ve overcome many challenges, and your resilience speaks volumes about your strength and determination! Don’t hesitate to reach out for more help and support within and outside of your workplace. You are more than enough!

Thank you for finding the courage to share about what you’re going through here. I hear how it’s affecting you and how distressing it gets (to the point of wanting to avoid people altogether), but your thoughts and feelings about your current situation is nonetheless valid.
I think your anxiety has a purpose here - I wonder if it is trying to protect you from being hurt/rejected/judged. It sounds like your anxious thoughts is looking out for you and leads you to have anticipatory anxiety to prepare yourself for a negative scenario. And as you become more (and more) vigilant, looking out for signs, etc., your body’s stress mechanism (kinda like the fight-or-flight response) is hijacked and responding way more than it should - that leads you to living a life that is not the way you want it to be (I wonder if this is what you mean by “I can’t be myself anywhere”) . However, some anxiety is normal and helpful still instead of seeing that any anxiety is bad or letting it snowball too much.
I also wanna commend you on wanting to do something about your situation by reaching out. I wonder what you’ve tried before to help you cope? I hear you about finding it difficult to talk to your parents, what about other close people or perhaps the school counsellor? And at the same time, we can do something about your anxious feelings and thoughts of worry by increasing your ability to handle distress - some of the ways to help calm your mind and body are through:
- deep breathing
- being mindful of the present
- checking if your thoughts are accurate & helpful: I hear you say “…have no one to share my struggles with” but can you truly not have anyone to share with? I think you’ve made that first step by coming on here to share
Hopefully, this helps build the courage within you to feel comfortable around people (which probably looks like starting small and slowly with people you feel safe with before moving on to others) and to live the life you want for yourself. Hope to hear more from you and remember that you deserve and can get the support you need!

The most recent one would be at October last year. Me and my brother have been living abroad and they came to visit us. And he said “I didn’t even want to come here in the first place, it’s costly. Even for this five day stay, the price is -----. I came bc you two are here.” The way he said it and the tone, like it was a bother to come see us (at least it seemed that way to me). I wanted to scream back at him. Tell him that if he doesn’t want to come then don’t come. I never asked him to come see me. But of course, I didn’t do that. Like why was his focus on the price and how costly it was. He’s already here with us. Why can’t he focus on how happy he was to see us? (Was he even happy to see us?)
My mother told me that he didn’t mean it that way. He just meant that he would not normally take this costly trip if not for us. And just I should just let it go. I talked about this to my brother and he told me not to think about it too much. This is just one example. And for some reason, every time I think about one event similar events that happened a long time ago like four/five years or so came rushing back to me (snowball effect I assume). I tried, still trying to let those go and not think about it but how can I?
I understand that miscommunications happen but every time it was always my mom saying “Oh, he just doesn’t know how to choose his words, just let it go, it will pass” and my brother saying “Just dont think about it too much”. And him, still the same with no hint of changing that aspect about him (He doesn’t see that as a problem at all). At times, I think I am overreacting and being too emotional. Since it seems like I’m the only one who’s frustrated with him. He doesn’t smoke, drink or gamble. I am where I am now because of his support in my education both local and abroad.
On one hand I am grateful but on the other, I am angry that he is not trying to be better and people around him need to fill in the gaps. And the scary part is, when I ask myself do I love dad? It’s not a “Yes!!!”. It’s not even a “Maybe” anymore. I want to talk to him but at the same time, I don’t feel safe. I am scared of what he might say and the new kinds of hurts his words might bring me.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your pain and struggles, I hear you and I can sense the deep emotional impact these interactions with your father have had on you, and it’s completely valid to feel hurt and frustrated. It’s difficult when communication becomes a source of distress within the family.
Here are a couple of suggestions to work around this situation:
2. Express Your Feelings through Writing: I highly encourage you to consider writing a letter to your father expressing your emotions and concerns. This can be a therapeutic way to articulate your thoughts without the immediate fear of his immediate reaction. You could start by sharing specific instances that have hurt you (like this recent event) and how it has affected your perception of the relationship. This can provide him with a deeper understanding of the impact his words have on you.
3. Empathise with him too: I can imagine if your father is not willing to accept or empathise your feelings, and I can imagine must be difficult for him too. It’s important to recognise that he is also trying to be a parent, and perhaps he may not have the skills to manage this lack of communication properly. However, I encourage you to prepare yourself emotionally and empathise with him, understanding that he is also trying to figure things out. The truth is, we are all imperfect and there is no perfect parent. It is important for both parent and child to have mutual empathy and respect for the different phases in their lives too.
4. Seek Professional Mediation: Considering the complexity of your emotions and the dynamics within your family, seeking the help of a family therapist or counselor might be helpful. A neutral third party can facilitate a safe space for communication, helping all family members express their feelings and concerns. Professional guidance can also provide tools and strategies to improve communication and understanding within the family.
Last but not least, remember, it’s okay to seek support when needed. We are here for you and we will continue to support you. Please let us know if you’ve managed to try out any of the suggestions or anything else. Hear from you soon.",,2,,11621,,11621.0,

Grieving and experiencing anxiety can be incredibly overwhelming. First and foremost, please allow yourself the space to grieve and acknowledge your emotions. It’s okay not to have it all figured out right away.
As you process this difficult time, here are a couple of suggestions:
2. Seek Professional Support: I highly encourage you to consider talking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in grief and anxiety. They can provide a safe space for you to express your feelings, explore coping mechanisms, and work through the anxiety that has emerged since your uncle’s passing. Here are some ways you can seek professional support to process your grief:
- Talk to a counsellor from a nearby Family Service Centre
- Talk to a counsellor online :

Hi @Lauren
Thank you for sharing your worries and concerns. I’m sorry to hear that you’re going through a challenging situation right now. It sounds like there’s been some miscommunication and misunderstanding. It’s completely normal for conflicts to arise, especially in a school setting.
Here are some suggestions that you can try:
2. When you meet with the teacher, it might be helpful to calmly and honestly express your perspective on the matter. You can try to focus on expressing your feelings and experiences without assigning blame. For example, use “I” statements to communicate how certain situations made you feel rather than accusing the other girl. This can create a more open and understanding conversation.
3. Share your feelings, but try to avoid getting defensive. Maybe you can also express a willingness to find a resolution and work together to create a more positive environment in the class? Communication is key, and I believe addressing the situation openly might lead to a better understanding for everyone involved.
Last but not least, do seek support if needed. If the situation persists, don’t hesitate to seek support from your school counsellor or another trusted adult/teacher. It might be helpful to get more insights on how to manage this issue, and they might possibly be able to help guide you with a resolution.
Remember, conflicts are a part of life, and it’s how we approach and resolve them that helps us grow Do let us know how you’re coping and if you’ve managed to try any suggestions. Hear from you soon!", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/being-blamed/8095/1,0,,11541,,11541.0,11541

Thank you for sharing with us what happened, and I’m truly sorry to hear about the passing of the security officer, and I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like a very distressing and unexpected situation.The fact that you were the last person he spoke to adds another layer of complexity to your feelings. It’s completely natural to feel a mix of shock, sadness, and perhaps even guilt.
I would like to encourage you with these suggestions, please do read:
2. Allow Yourself to Grieve: Give yourself permission to feel the emotions that come up. It’s okay to be sad, confused, or even angry because of what happened. Grieving is a process, and everyone experiences it differently.
3. Talk About It: Share your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust – a friend, family member, or a colleague. Sometimes, expressing your emotions can help alleviate the weight you might be carrying.
4. Seek Professional Support: If you find it challenging to cope on your own, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe and confidential space for you to explore your emotions and offer guidance on how to cope with the grief that you’re experiencing.
Grieving is a unique and individual process, and it’s okay to give yourself the space to process these emotions at your own pace. I can tell that it’s a very distressing and perhaps even traumatic experience, and I would highly encourage you to seek professional counseling or therapy to help walk you through this grieving process.
Here are some ways you can seek professional help:
- Walk in to the nearest Family Service Centre to speak to a professional
You can also try these online options:
- Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
- ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg

It’s likely he did not understand the terms and conditions of opening this account so now he’s not sure what to do.

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your concerns with your friend. I hear how much of care you have for him, I believe this comes from how much you value your friendship with him. You’re worried about his financial state especially with the need to refinance the loan in a favourable manner, that doesn’t impact him further.
I wonder if you’d had the chance to speak to him about this? Like what kinda led to this situation in the first place? I wonder what your friend thinks about the the impact towards his financial status? Let’s say he does kinda have an idea, we can nudge him along by acknowledging his ambivalence (maybe he had 2 opposing thoughts at the time - maybe he felt confident about taking the loan AND maybe he was unsure about improving his financial situation).
When you listen to him, I think it can be helpful when you listen actively, asking open-ended questions to let him feel comfortable to share, and reflecting what you heard to let him know that you can see from his point-of-view. Perhaps something along the lines of “I can see that you found it hard dealing with your finances … and you were just doing what you thought best for yourself…”
And when you share your concerns about his situation, you can use I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like done instead). This way, you can get your concerns across too and in a manner that your friend can listen and understand clearly. Perhaps this helps him along by increasing his motivation (and reducing resistance) to do something differently (e.g., other alternatives that the both of you can figure out together instead of him getting money from you) as he sees more on how his actions has an impact on his financial state and with his relationship with you.
I hope this helps you a bit and let us know how else we can support you in this. Looking forward to hearing what you think about this, yeah!",,2,,11451,,11451.0,
8031,Older sister hates me,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/older-sister-hates-me/8031,Seeking Help,---,6459,tryingvhard,User,,11368,1,"my (26) older sister (29) has been dealing with some form of mental health issues for at least 10-12 years now. it was ok for a while and then it got so much worse after marriage and now shes divorced with a child. we live together with our mom (single mom since i was born) now. At the current state, i feel like im walking on minefield bc one thing i say wrongly makes her lash out on me and my mom (accusing her of supporting me).
i cant help but wonder if i caused my sister to be like this. when i was young and stupid as a teen, i shouted at her because she was being an awful daughter and granddaughter. she constantly was rude to my gma and mom and i couldn’t stand it. tbh even in recent years before my gma died she was awful to her. and i had to butt in and defend my gma… in hindsight, she was probably like that because she was depressed. but maybe these incidents and me acting like i had moral superiority made her resent me even more. it doesn’t help that i had a “better” life going overseas for school and being single while she was stuck in sg and had a bad marriage AND a child as a single mom. she constantly brings these up when she can. (e.g., “oh you’re so perfect and happy while I’m the problem child and made all the bad life choices”)
since i live with my nephew now, i try to be present in his life bc he shouldn’t be affected by my bad r/s with my sister. i buy him stuff and make sure i go out with them on weekends. but she says i don’t spend enough on him, don’t offer to pay for school fees etc. and im stingy. she says i don’t care about them and only care about going out with friends. i KNOW im trying to spend a lot of time with my nephew (i buy him presents, etc) idk why it never seems enough to her. it came to the point where my mom defended me on two occasions and both times my sister got so mad she became physical (pushed/shoved my mom). i hate myself for causing this rift within my family and I’ve no idea what to do. im trying to be patient and not react to what my sister says (and feed into her anger) but its hard sometimes. my mom and i tried to get us all to go to family therapy but my sis refuses to cooperate. now her mental health is just deteriorating and being at home feels miserable. i love my nephew but im scared of being judged by my sister for every interaction i have with him. im also scared he’ll grow up in a dysfunctional family (ours). i feel bad for my mom who has to try to deal with my sister’s hatred towards me (and by extension hating my mom for taking my side at times).
i tried to tell my sister i wanted to stay out of her life because of how much pain it caused all of us. my mom encouraged me to apply for a masters overseas. but my sis accused me of not caring about my family and trying to escape and lead my “fun single life” while she and my mom stayed here and “suffered”. that’s not what i meant. anyway i haven’t applied because im so exhausted from work and coming home feeling even more tired having to think about how my every action could cause more havoc.
today, my mom cried and scolded me for making things even harder for my family because i took my sister’s snide comment to heart and refused to go out with them. my mom then defended me and got verbally abused and shoved by my sister. my mom didn’t deserve that. i didn’t deserve to be defended bc i chose to be selfish in that moment. i know my sister has a tough life and is likely depressed but i find it so hard to be patient and let things slide ALL the time. when i don’t let things slide my mom ends up being hurt in the process and now i cant help but think im the cause of everyone’s problems. i just want to not exist anymore. what do i do… im also very sorry for this being so long!!!",,4,11440.0,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us how you feel, I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult and emotionally taxing situation. I can see that you care deeply for your family, and I acknowledge the complexity of the dynamics involved.
Firstly, I would encourage you to consider seeking individual counselling for yourself. A mental health professional can provide a safe space for you to explore your emotions, help you process the guilt you’re feeling, and offer coping strategies to help you manage your feelings. Please do consider reaching out for help from any of these methods:
2. Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
3. CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
4. IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
5. ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
6. Walk into a Family Service Centre near your home
Next, I think it’s important to set clear boundaries with your sister. You could let her know that while you care about her, you cannot tolerate physical aggression or constant verbal abuse, and reinforce that a healthy relationship requires mutual respect.
While your sister may resist, you can gently encourage her to seek professional help for her mental health too. It’s challenging to support someone who refuses help, but expressing concern and offering resources might make a difference to her over time. Don’t give up on encouraging her to seek help.
Also, how about trying to initiate a calm and open conversation with your family about the need for healthier communication? You can try emphasizing that everyone’s well-being is important, and consider discussing strategies for coping with stress within the family.
Most importantly, self-care is foundational. You can’t help others effectively if you’re not taking care of your own mental and emotional well-being Make sure to engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation and find ways to help you to de-stress and feel emotionally well again.
If possible, I would also encourage you to explore the option of mediation or family counselling. A neutral third party can sometimes facilitate communication and help family members express their feelings in a constructive manner.
Last but not least, please remember that you are not solely responsible for your sister’s choices and actions. It’s a collective effort within the family to work towards healthier dynamics. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out for professional support.
Please let us know how you’re coping and share with us your feelings. We’ll be here to support you.

It must have been hard to see your mum cry. Actually I think mums are very noble and she probably doesn’t blame you nor your sister for the current situation.
I think at some point your sister needs to realize that you’re not responsible for her life. You have your own life to lead. Yes you can be as empathetic as you want but eventually you might start a family and move out too so you cannot be responsible for her wellbeing (and her son’s wellbeing).
Your mum however probably feels some responsibility to support your sister. I think all parents feel that way and is probably finding ways for you to take control of your own life by suggesting an overseas masters. But at the same time, it seems to me that she also cherishes the time that y’all have left together because (read above para, you’ll start your own family eventually).
It’s a tricky situation, not one that can be resolved easily. I think you can be as supportive as you want for now but also don’t put the blame on yourself, it’s not your responsibility.", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/older-sister-hates-me/8031/1,1,,11368,,,11368

in terms of getting my sister help, we’ll continue to try asking! last time i tried (two weeks ago) she just stopped talking to me and left…my mom and i have decided to start going to therapy/counselling ourselves first, and then slowly bring her in when she’s ready and sees we’re going ourselves too!! hopefully this will help my mom and i figure out how to support my sis better.

When he gets angry, he gets out of control such as as smashing things and once he even kicked our house’s artificial wall and punctured a hole in it… Now he is 25 years old and he is staying with his girlfriend. From what I heard from him, sometimes his emotions can be so intense during their arguments, he would like to smash things or even punch the wall which resulted in him hurting himself. Some of the things he has smashed is his ipad he is using for uni and even a monitor… I guess he does not want to physically harm any humans, so he uses items instead to relieve his stress/anger.
This is definitely not normal and I wish he is able to seek help but he is not very receptive about the idea of seeking professional help. I have been telling him for months that he MUST seek help and this is not normal. He always tells me that he won’t ever do it again and yet time and time again, his anger cannot be controlled.
When he isn’t angry, my brother is a very happy and carefree person. So he likes to ease everyone into thinking that he is fine and that everything is normal… When we bring up such topics about seeking help when he is in this happy/carefree state, he would happily brush it off at first until we get into his nerve again and tell us that we are trying to ruin his image. He also told us that if we keep on mentioning things like his problems and telling him to seek help, he would get even more stressed and his studies would be affected. He is now in his final semester of Uni and is about to graduate soon. I am just very worried about his future, as he might turn into an abusive family member in the future or he might even harm himself further during these anger episodes.
Please give me advice on how my family can help my brother and how we can convince him to seek professional help without triggering him.",,1,,,,,

Thanks for coming on and sharing about your struggles. I hear how much concern that you have for your older brother, and that shows more how much of care you have for him (kinda like your username) and his wellbeing given how his anger responses appear quite intense.
You’re worried of the effects of his anger towards the people close to him as well as his studies, though he tries to release his anger on things and not hurt others. You’re able to observe this and trying to offer him a channel to seek help although he appears to not be as ready for it, as compared to the family…
Typically emotions serve as a messenger on how we feel about a situation, which provides information about what we seek or could be short of. In this case, your brother’s anger is experienced and expressed in a manner that I wonder might not exactly address his need fully. Also, though his anger is expressed, is the initial issue regarding it (e.g., boundaries crossed, perceived to be treated unfairly, feeling hurt, etc.) resolved? What is it that he really needs that is not met?
I hear you about the option of professional support as you can see the value of reaching out. Perhaps he can also reach out to people that he feels comfortable with and trust to help him open up more to the possibility of talking about it. Perhaps having an open conversation (using open-endeds question like, “How are you coping with studies? How are things at your place”) where everyone is calm, might get to hear from him about how he really feels and then getting yourself heard by sharing your thoughts and feelings with I statements: I think/feel … because… and I would prefer that (what you would like done instead). This way, you can get your concerns across and in a manner that your brother can listen and understand clearly. And hopefully this non-judgmental stance helps him to get his thoughts and feelings across in a similar manner.

Sounds like anger management issues. Does he recognize that it’s hard for him to control his anger?
Maybe when he is happy, can set some ground rules with him that he shouldn’t be smashing and damaging stuff - and if he does, then he’ll need to go see a professional with you.
Or actually if you wanna try take things in your own hands, maybe can find and share alternative ways to cope with the anger?

Thank you for sharing your experiences, and I want to acknowledge the challenges you’ve faced in your career and the impact that ADHD has had on your life. I can tell that you’re working through a complex and sometimes frustrating journey - I hear you and I feel you.
ADHD can indeed present unique challenges, especially in the workplace where interactions and expectations may differ. But I think it’s great that you’ve gained awareness of your ADHD, as this self-awareness is an important first step toward finding strategies that work for you.
Here are some suggestions that might help you work more effectively with neurotypical individuals and work through the complexities of the workplace:
2. Open Communication:
- Be open and honest about your ADHD with colleagues if you feel comfortable. It can foster understanding and create an environment where people are more supportive.
3. Advocate for Yourself:
- Clearly communicate your needs, whether it’s about workspace arrangements, deadlines, or task assignments. Advocating for accommodations that suit your working style can make a significant difference.
4. Break Tasks into Smaller Steps:
- Breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps can help you stay organized and focused. It also makes it easier for neurotypical colleagues to understand your process.
5. Use Tools and Technology:
- Leverage organizational tools, calendars, and apps to help you stay on top of deadlines and tasks. This can be helpful for both you and your neurotypical colleagues.
6. Establish Routines:
- Creating routines can add structure to your day and enhance productivity. Share these routines with your colleagues so they can better understand your work style.
7. Set Boundaries:
- It’s okay to say no when necessary. Setting boundaries is crucial for everyone, and it’s a skill that can be developed over time.
8. Educate Others:
- If you encounter misunderstandings or biases, consider educating your colleagues about ADHD and its impact. Awareness often leads to empathy and better collaboration.
Remember, it’s okay to ask for support, and perhaps seeking guidance from a mental health professional or ADHD coach can provide you with more personalized strategies You’re not alone, and I truly believe that your unique perspective and strengths can be valuable assets in any workplace.

Its the last semester of polytechnic for me, im doing way better at studies than before, im helping out with projects more and overall school feels great with friends and i like everyone
Career wise im also a derivatives trader on the side, can make decent income (way more than your average student). Im also starting a new startup regarding trading which is going okay, nothing too crazy. Taking it slow
Besides that i am also being trained to be a financial consultant from people that i absolutely look up to and like, which is what i always wanted, but took a break for these 2 months to focus on last bit of school
Personal life-wise is great, talking to a potential someone these days, and the friends i have now are the closest friends ive had in my life. They have opened up new opportunities for me career wise and we have done nearly every teenage-thing possible from clubbing to travelling
Family is also great, i love everyone in my family
But i dont know why i feel so trapped, like a squeezed feeling. I feel like im not loose if that makes sense. It feels so weird, not really sad, not really empty, just super weird
I just feel like take my boxing gloves and smashing my head in a couple of times
Ive felt like this the past month, but last weekend i went to have drinks with my friends, we talked about life, girls and career, and for the next week I was at my best state

Thank you for sharing what is working well and also not going so well in your life. I think it is wonderful that you have found joy in trading, are financial independent and have great relationships at home and also outside.
A couple of years back I was feeling the same way too. And as i researched, spoke to mentors, and was more well-read, i realised that it could have been my life PURPOSE that I was unclear about.
Here is something that helped me. You can try it to see if it works for you.
Ask yourself:
- if you did not have school, family and friends, what would you be still excited to be waking up every day to do?
- can this be a constant and not a milestone or goal? For eg if your goal is to earn $20,000 a month then once you meet this goal, you might feel empty again.
Crafting a personal purpose statement like this might help you gain better clarity.
My purpose is to (insert verb) (insert beneficiary) (insert how), to (insert result) (insert outcome).
eg. My purpose is to help young people gain greater awareness through education, to attain financial freedom so as to achieve their other life goals.
good luck!",,1,,,,,

First off, thanks for sharing with us about what you’re currently going through. You’re trying to figure out what you’re experiencing and perhaps why too, but no matter what it is, I wanna let you know that whatever emotions and thoughts about your current state is valid.
You seem to have a lot of self-awareness and you’ve made helpful choices when the situation calls for it - like taking a step back to focus on school, taking things one step at a time with regards to your startup, spending time with people that matter to you. I wanna commend you on that as that seems to be your personal strengths! I wonder with what you’re also feeling, it sounds like apathy but at the same time “trapped”, could it be signalling something about other areas or aspect of yourself (that’s unfulfilled)?
I also wonder if you’re noticed when this kinda started for you? Did something happen to lead you to feel this way? Or has it kinda been there all this while? Perhaps you can take this opportunity to take stock of what you would want to do for yourself. I believe that you’re looking to live a life that is true to who you are and want to be. You can generate insight through a process of asking yourself a series of focused, open-ended questions, which encourages reflection, to gain new perspective and perhaps positive actions to take. This could be a gentle way to clarify any (mis)assumptions and allows you to revise what you think and say about those beliefs (by updating the belief to be more helpful).
Additionally, you can try the below exercises to help if you feel that things are beginning to get overwhelming for you:
• Being mindful
• Being kind to yourself
• Shifting (to a more helpful) perspective
Also, here’s a list of resources that you can check out if you’d like to speak to a professional as they can provide you with a safe space and work together with you to help you work things through:

I often start to think without reading other people’s words clearly.
I did something wrong in the group several times, and I didn’t even finish my homework with them this time.

It’s normal to be hated if you don’t know anything … but before the class officially started, I felt that she didn’t like me very much, even though she would still smile at me, but I didn’t feel that others were indifferent to me, but she I really felt that she hated me.
She often ignores me and feels bad. I think maybe I think too much, but it’s really hard to tell anyone.
Moreover, I feel that I can’t keep up with my study progress, and now I have some tendencies not to study.

Thank you for sharing with us how you feel and what you’re struggling with, and I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way, but I want you to know that your feelings are valid. I can see that you’re going through a difficult time, and it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. I want to encourage you that your worth as a person is not determined by your academic performance or how others may perceive you.
I understand, starting a new group can be tough, and it’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone has their own learning style and pace, and it doesn’t make you “stupid” or “garbage.” It’s understandable that you might be feeling isolated, especially if you’re struggling with communication in a new environment. It’s important to give yourself some grace and recognize that making adjustments takes time.
It’s also okay to reach out for support Talking about your feelings with someone you trust can be a relief, whether it’s a friend, family member, or even a counsellor. I would really encourage you to speak to your counsellor about your feelings and receive emotional support on a regular basis in school.
Also, I can hear that you’re feeling exhausted and questioning your path. If you’re having thoughts of self-harm, I strongly encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional or your school counsellor as soon as you can. Please know that your life is valuable, and there are people who care and want to support you.
Remember that it’s okay to ask for help and that you don’t have to face everything alone. Please do let us know how you’re coping now, we would love to continue to hear from you because you matter to us.

Though initially I was coping fine but recently I have been progressively getting worse.
I finally sought help at my school’s counseling centre last Dec when things were getting bad and accepted that I couldn’t talk to my friends or family. But now I keep getting rescheduled and so far have only went for one intake session with my counselor a month ago. My first session was supposed to be a few days ago but got rescheduled to 2 months later. The past few weeks while waiting for my originally scheduled session was just terrible but I tried to be hopeful that it was coming up, but to have it rescheduled again to Mar made me feel overwhelmingly helpless. I can’t even imagine surviving until then, though I always do end up surviving. As it is, it was difficult for me to decide to seek help and it was supposed to be like my last resort, but this just made me feel so helpless now. I can’t help but keep feeling like nobody wants to help me anymore and like I’m abandoned, unwanted and left all alone, even though I know that it’s not my counselor’s fault so I feel really bad for thinking this way.
The past few months I really tried to help myself get better by trying journaling, going out more, seeking help, reading, and trying to learn how else I can cope. But at this point I just feel so hopeless, like I’m broken but I don’t know how to fix myself back up anymore. I feel like I’m fading away and getting worse until I won’t be okay again, and I’m really worried about these thoughts I’m having and I don’t want myself to get any worse than this.
Also I’m finding it hard to cope with school and work. There are some days where I just couldn’t function and I’m so afraid it will happen again and I end up not being able to go to class or submit my work. I don’t know what to do anymore.",,3,,,,,

Thank you for coming on and sharing about your struggles. Your feelings are still raw and I wanna commend your courage in reaching out, not only here but in your many ways to help yourself through this difficult times. Losing a parent is tough and I can’t imagine the pain that you’re going through. Grief has been described as a process that is non-linear and that it also comes in waves; rather than the pain going away/stopping, I wonder if you’ll experience its effects differently with time.
It’s also a difficult experience for you that when you sought counselling for help, which is supposed to be offered in a gentle and non-distressing manner, the opposite happened However the things you did for yourself instead is a testament to your resilience and I wanna encourage you to continue doing that, especially to help out with your mood, even though just for a bit…And that the experience with your counsellor hopefully can be a way that allows you to process your grief, together with the feelings you had while awaiting for session.
I hear you when you say you feel broken given you feel separated with your loss. I think that your parts rather than put back together in the same way, will now be parts with new memories, feelings, experiences that is not the same as before. Nothing can be said to make it less painful butI wonder if this pain can be transformed into something else? Something that you can do to honour your grief and memory of your dad?
Also, you can consider reaching out to Family Service Centres as they also have professionals that can support you in a non-judgmental manner to help you cope and work through with school and work, one at a time.

Thanks for sharing with us about your struggles. I hear you about what you’re currently experiencing with your partner, it’s perfectly valid for you to be thinking and feeling the way you do, given what you’ve experienced these past years and needing to live away from your own home.
You mentioned that you sought help before - I wonder what that was and how it helped each of you? You mentioned about your partner’s anxiety and it sounds like working through by getting him back home is proving to be very challenging. I also wonder what he means when he mentions that the house ‘drains his energy’ as the act of being in the house and now even thinking about it also affects him greatly. Anxiety does have a function of keeping one alert and noticing problems, so I wonder what is it that is truly affecting him?
But the most important thing now is you and your experience. How are you taking care of yourself throughout this? Are you able to find time for yourself and ensure that you’re also being looked out for. Perhaps in this moment of distress, can you also try these exercises where possible
- Being mindful
- Being kind to yourself
- Shifting (to a more helpful) perspective
Another way to ensure that you’re also cared for is through open communication. How that looks like is finding the right moment to speak (no distractions, both are calm, etc), know what you want, being clear with your message, talk about how it affects you and using I statements to convey what you feel (“I feel…”), want (“I want…) as well as need (“I need…”).
Also, you can consider reaching out to Family Service Centres as they have professionals that can support you in a non-judgmental manner to help you cope and discover ways to work through your situation.

several years ago i lost a handful of my friends , some because they got bored of me and some just got pissed at every little thing i say, even a greeting and then ghosted me. even after they made me cry for nights, i still feel attached to them and even begged one of them to befriend me again. am i rlly that desperate for a friendship??? i don’t know
but now im too scared to make friends or get close to anyone because i fear they’ll get sick of me. sometimes i see myself pretending to be smth im not bc i want to fit their ideal friend standard. maybe then they won’t leave me.
i think i feel very lonely. even with my group of friends in school, which i consider quite a lot of friends, i still feel very lonely i don’t know why. im scared they’ll get bored of me and leave me again if i open up to them. maybe im a boring person
i have always wanted to talk to someone about everything i am feeling, but i feel like telling my friends will just burden them, and give them more pressure in top of school.
i also struggle where i don’t know if im in a one sided friendship. i’ve been in a few recently and it hurts. i just don’t know whether they like or hate me. i know it’s one sided because if i never text first, we can go on not talking for months. it hurts to know that only i am tryibg to maintain our friendship. but while knowing that, i still feel very attached to them and if they leave me i will apologise and try to change myself in order to become a better friend. i think i don’t have any self respect but i really really treasure my friendships and i think it’s all because im a boring person to be with?? or maybe my personality is just ublikable i don’t know anymore but i am very lonely and sad. please tell me what is wrong with me i want to be normal",,7,,,,,

Thanks for coming on this forum then and sharing what you’re currently going through. I’m sorry to hear about your experiences with friendship. Losing friends must’ve been very painful and the feelings still appear very raw given your efforts to do all you can to maintain them. All of this sounds super hard and tiring for you.
I can see why friendships are so important to you. People are hardwired for connections, as we are social creatures, so friendships is one of our ways to make connections, and sometimes even crave for it. From what I hear, you value connection a lot, you treasure the company, support and joy of being a friend to others and having friends. Perhaps here is where you can take stock of your values and to see what’s really important that you look out for in a friend. What do you think are your values ? Perhaps you can note them down and give them some thought. I find that values can kinda be a guide to help us live a life that is true to who we ARE and want to BE.
We also hold on to some things thinking it’s dear but perhaps we might need to let go some parts of it. Maybe it’s the perception or idea if what a friend is or what friendships should look like? There’s this concept called locus of control where we try to see how much of control (on a continuum) we have over what happens. At the same time, having an internal locus of control (believe you have control) does not always equal good and external locus of control (believe that you have no control and external things impact it) does not always equal bad. This is where I echo what Otterworldly said about being on their own journey and “try to control what I can which is how do I want to view and feel about it”.
Of course, this will be rather difficult and perhaps you might have to process this with someone, perhaps in a setting that is safe and without judgment. I believe that we’d be more than happy to listen and if you’d like to, you can also consider speaking to professionals from Family Service Centres .

Thank you for sharing your struggles here with us, I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a tough time, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. It takes a lot of courage to express these emotions. It’s very common for people dealing with anxiety to feel overwhelmed, doubting their abilities, and having thoughts of wanting to escape from everything.
Your experiences do sound like they align with symptoms of anxiety, and it’s understandable that reaching out for help can be scary, especially when there’s a fear of not being believed or understood by those close to you. Remember that you’re not alone, and seeking support is a brave step!
Here are two things you might consider doing to help manage your anxiety:
2. Journaling: Take some time each day to write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal. This can provide a healthy outlet for your emotions and help you gain a better understanding of your triggers and patterns. Reflecting on your experiences may also help you identify moments of strength and resilience.
3. Mindfulness or Relaxation Techniques: Explore mindfulness or relaxation exercises to help calm your mind. Techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation can be effective in reducing anxiety. Do click on each of the link to try out the tools! There are also various apps and online resources that offer guided sessions, making it accessible for you to practice at your own pace
It might be helpful to also explore different avenues for support, whether it’s confiding in a trusted friend, a teacher, or seeking resources online. While I’m here to provide support and validation, I also want to encourage you to consider reaching out to a mental health professional or counselor who can offer guidance and support for you.
I encourage you to reach out to a counsellor who is accessible for you, such as a school counsellor or a counsellor from a nearby Family Service Centre.
It’s important to prioritize your well-being, and you deserve understanding and support. You’re not alone in this, and there are people who care about you.

Yeah I agree life may seem hard at times but remember to give yourself credit where it’s due okay I can tell that you are already doing your best .
I’m still schooling and there was a period of time when school work became too overwhelming for me when I ended up having thoughts like ‘why is it so hard am I not working hard enough ?’ and ‘why are other people so much more competent than me getting good internships here and there while I was not doing much.’ At that point in time I didn’t really have alot of people I could speak to about this also
All these negative emotions and thoughts crowded my mind and made it tough for me to gather motivation to do things but one day after speaking to someone close to me I decided I can’t go on like this so I sought help from a counsellor.
It really gave me a safe space and helped me work through my emotions and find out for myself what I needed to do to overcome these issues. Today I’m still working on some of these issues but I feel more ready to tackle these problems.
Maybe you can give that a try if you don’t feel comfortable sharing with your family yet, what do you think ?

It’s definitely a THEY problem not a YOU problem.
Maybe not once or twice you were asked to meet at midnight (been there ) and you’re thinking is it too much to ask to meet at a more reasonable time? Spoiler Alert, it’s not!
Needing attention and connection are basic human needs and you should surround yourself with people who thinks you deserve this.
As a context, I’ve been using dating apps for 10 years
When I started, I always think maybe I’m expecting too much. But trust me, you’ll find someone who respects all the boundaries you have.

Thanks for sharing about your experience on a dating app. I’m sorry the experience you had didn’t match what you were hoping for; there seems to be a huge disconnect in the values you seek vs what these people are seeking instead. I can see how that affects your mental health too, it is definitely anxiety-provoking, especially if it’s bringing out memories of a particular event.
I think we all agree that human beings seek connection, and in deeper connection we can find comfort, passion in shared values and achieving goals together. Again, you do seem to have some self-awareness as you try to figure out if this behaviours you currently display follow a pattern or theme. I’m curious when you mentioned that you think it’s due to loneliness or not receiving enough attention as a child. I’m also curious why you mentioned you only have a few years to find a partner?
I wonder if this sort of insight might point you towards your desired needs and to perhaps figure out other ways to get them – the value of connection need not come only from a romantic partner. You can try out this exercise to determine what are the things you most value. Next, you can kinda zero in on what is/are the most important values about relationship that you seek out:
- What do you look for: List the things you want in your main relationships. Then, ask yourself how you contribute to the things you want. For example, if you want honesty in your relationships, honesty is likely one of your values.
- What are your deal-breakers: List the things you can’t/won’t tolerate in your relationships. Then, ask yourself how you can behave to avoid those deal-breakers. For example, if you don’t want dishonesty that’s another way to recognize that honesty is one of your values.
- How can you change to attract these kinds of people: Although we can’t choose all of our relationships, like parents and relatives, we can play a role in attracting our friends and romantic partners. Imagine the kind of people you want to be around, then identify the values you’d like to exemplify in that company. For example, if you want supportive friends, then being a supportive friend may be one of your values.
I recall you mentioning that you also want to prioritise your mental health in another post, so remember to take care of yourself too in those other areas!

First, I want to affirm your courage to share your struggles and to let you know that we are here for you. It must be a hard feeling to think that everything you do is causing problems to others. You mentioned being unstable and wanting to disappear. I would imagine there is a lot going on in your life now and you’re feeling really overwhelmed.
Before proceeding further, I really want to make sure that you’re safe. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself/others, please approach SOS or IMH immediately as they are able to work through with you on the issues you are facing.
Please call either of these numbers:
SOS—1-767
IMH—6389 2222
There may be times when things in life get tough and the overwhelming feelings may make us want to look for an escape. Here are 4 steps you can take to rebalance yourself:
2. Get some space—Stepping away from the situation you’re in and taking a few moments for yourself can help reduce the feelings of being overwhelmed and helplessness. Sometimes wanting to disappear could mean taking a walk, listening to your favourite songs, or spending time in nature.
3. Next, identify the source of this feeling—check in with yourself to get to the root of what’s going on to cause the feeling. Ask yourself, “What is making me feel this way?” and be honest with your answer because that’s what you’re looking for.
4. From there, take a look at what you can change—If you think that what you’re doing isn’t what you want to do and is perhaps contributing to conflicts/problems, talk to someone you trust to support you in making the changes you want. If you think that you’re unable to manage your fluctuating emotions, consider seeking therapy. There is always a way to deal with the situation instead of disappearing altogether.
5. Alter your narrative—Sometimes, it really is not what you think it is. How we perceive a situation can influence how we feel about it. For instance, rather than thinking “everything is my fault” or “I want to disappear”, try to name what wants you to disappear. Telling yourself “anger/guilt/loneliness wants me to disappear” can put some distance between you and these thoughts. This may help you take a step back and realise that it is these unhelpful thoughts that want you to disappear.

Thank you for sharing with us your feelings, I appreciate you being so real and authentic with your struggles. I’m sorry to hear that you’re going through this difficult situation. I want to commend you for recognizing the toxicity and took the step to end the friendship. Moving on from such relationships can be painful, but there are strategies that might help you process these feelings:
2. Focus on Self-Care: Take time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Engage in hobbies, spend time with positive friends, or indulge in activities that boost your well-being.
3. Establish Boundaries: If possible, minimize contact with this person. This doesn’t mean you have to completely avoid her, but try to create some distance to protect yourself emotionally.
4. Surround Yourself with Supportive People: Strengthen connections with friends who have a positive influence on you. Sharing your feelings with supportive individuals can provide validation and comfort.
5. Seek Professional Support: If your frustration persists, consider talking to a school counselor or a mental health professional. They can offer guidance on coping strategies and provide a safe space to discuss your feelings.
Remember, it’s okay to put your well-being as a priority, and distance yourself from toxic relationships. Moving on is a process, and it may take time, but do be patient with yourself as you continue to heal and move on.

I want to affirm you that it is already courageous to take the first step in ending a toxic relationship.
However, I also want to reassure you that change is hard, especially acting differently in front of someone who used to be your friend. I think a big part of wanting to be unbothered by this situation comes from you rushing to accept the new normal, be patient with yourself!

Thanks for sharing about your struggle with job interviews – I hear how anxiety-provoking the situation is for you and how it’s affecting you. The transition from school to the workforce is also a huge step and change of direction for many of us, and I want to let you know that what you’re going through and feeling is valid – it would be very overwhelming trying to figure out how to navigate the interview process… However, I wanna commend you for still taking the first step by applying for jobs and doing the research about the companies – that’s you putting the work and trying to rehearse despite the sensations you feel in your body and difficulties focusing. I wonder when you say that your mind goes blank and you look away from the interviewer, it feels like your fight or flight response was engaged, cause it wanted to protect you and ‘escape’ the situation due to the unpleasantness. All it wanted to do was to ‘survive’ this threatening situation, which is normal, but can be overestimated to the point where its benefit reduces opportunities for you to experience success in going through job interviews (among other fear-inducing situations). Right now, it’s making you very fearful and not going for the interviews – which should reduce the unpleasantness a bit but I’m guessing you’re worried that this can’t go on forever as you’ll just be caught in the cycle.
It sounds like the anxiousness is triggered with you trying to perform, getting your words and answer questions during the interview. I wonder if you’re able to kinda look deeper and do some investigating, like asking yourself, “where is this anxiousness coming from?”, “what else is my anxiousness trying to tell me?”. Maybe that might give you a clue and kinda inform you on what you can do about it?
In the meantime, you can try to manage some of your anxiousness with this mindfulness activity and try out practising your interview with someone you trust, kinda like a role-play but in a more controlled environment (you can choose a safe and calming place to practice). Perhaps you can get some open feedback too about your actual performance and make tweaks to increase your confidence. Also, it helps to take deep breaths when you notice your heartbeat getting faster (cause shallow breaths disrupts the balance of oxygen and sends out more stress hormones), to reduce the impact of the fight or flight response.
If it’s still too much and to the point that it puts a strain on your ability to concentrate and get things done, or your ability to take care of yourself, you may wish to consider seeking further professional assistance. Below are a list of resources that you can check out:

ever since i met my school friends it got really apparent i was the most introverted in the group but depending on the circumstances i would participate actively and actually have fun with them. usually, it would only take a day’s break to recharge before i get back to engaging with them again and they would be understanding but idk what’s so different from this year… i started feeling more irritated around them and the feelings of being left out and unheard started becoming worse. i can’t match up with their energy anymore because i’m really tired with school and when i try to get comfortable with being quiet all while still having fun with them they just stop engaging me altogether because i don’t “vibe” on the level of energy they do. another friend in the group also doesn’t really listen to me when i talk and either forgets she was talking to me or completely tunes me out and uses her phone, making me repeat what i said close to 4 times before i eventually give up as she asks a 5th time. now some of them don’t really acknowledge me outside of necessity during group work despite us communicating how we usually do, just lesser. idk if it’s just me having commitment issues with friend groups but i just feel really bad for being too tired to talk to them about it and choosing to focus on my studies more. i’ve brought up being left out before but they just told me to try and “participate more actively” so that i can feel included. i also feel really paranoid that they’re talking bad about me behind my back…",,2,,,,,

Thanks for taking the time to share with us your struggles, I hear you, and I can see that you’ve been experiencing some challenging dynamics within your friend group. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize your own coping mechanisms and to try to protect your friends from the intensity of your emotions. I want to commend you for being mindful of their comfort levels, even if it has sometimes led to misunderstandings in the past.
It’s actually very common for people’s needs and energy levels to fluctuate, especially in the context of school and other life pressures. It seems like you’re experiencing a shift in your dynamics with your current friend group, and that can be tough to accept. Feeling left out and unheard can be really isolating, and it’s understandable that it’s taking a toll on you.
I feel that focusing on your studies is a valid choice! It’s okay to take the time you need to recharge, and it’s also okay to set boundaries when you’re feeling overwhelmed It’s unfortunate that expressing your feelings of being left out hasn’t resulted in the support you need from your friends, and feeling paranoid about what might be said behind your back can be an added layer of stress.
While it might feel challenging to initiate a conversation about these issues, it could be worth finding a time to communicate your feelings with your friends. You could let them know that you value your friendship with them, but that you’re currently working through some personal challenges and need their understanding, which could open up a dialogue. It’s possible they may not fully grasp the impact their actions are having on you
If you need some practice or help with the conversation, here’s a helpful tool that may work for you: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Remember, your feelings are valid, and taking care of your mental well-being is important! If the current dynamic continues to take a toll on you, it might be worth exploring other social circles or seeking support from individuals who can understand and appreciate your need for a quieter, more supportive space. You deserve friendships that lift you up and make you feel heard and valued.

Firstly, thank you for sharing with us your feelings of exhaustion and frustration, I hear you, and it sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden right now. It takes a lot of courage to express these feelings, and I want you to know that your experiences are valid. Feeling tired, overwhelmed, and questioning your abilities can be really truly challenging. I want you to know that you’re not alone in this, and we are here to support you.
It’s okay to feel the way you do, and I want to encourage you that it’s not a reflection of your intelligence or worth as a person. Everyone faces obstacles, and it’s normal to have moments of self-doubt. It’s also okay to acknowledge that you’re finding it difficult to manage the pressure, as everyone has a limit or threshold to pressure too.
I am a little worried though, to hear about your social anxiety and the physical sensations you’re experiencing. Those feelings can be really tough to process. It might be helpful to explore these emotions further, either with someone you trust or a mental health professional who can provide support - would you please try to reach out to one near your home (e.g. through a Family Service Centre ) or a school counsellor or someone online here?

Today I broke down at work when my higher manager asked if everything was okay and if I had anything I wanted to say about my issues.
I just couldn’t control my emotions about some workplace bullying incidences by my line manager although I always told myself to never break down when issues arise cause it’s a big Nono at work. I told my manager that what the superior did to me (she was in the room) had taken a toll on my mental health. Prior to these tears, my boss had called me out on some late submissions I had.
In my previous workplace, I also broke down in front of my former higher manager about another bullying case by my superior.
As for now, I really don’t think much about my career progress and promotions because of what happened today and am more focused on my well being. But I feel much better today after all my crying because I can move on to action plans for my mind.
Prior to this I was crying uncontrollably at home at random times when I think of how unfair my treatment was at work. I even felt so demotivated to live and carry out life as it is.
Im not sure should I do some depression anxiety screening or what? I just feel my my body is recovering now",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing about what you just went through at work. It must’ve been really difficult so I’m glad you found the courage to open up to share this. I’m wondering how you must’ve felt in front of your manager… definitely feels like a pressure cooker situation especially with the bullying incident and you trying to hold it all in. I think the tears and sadness (or perhaps even some anger) could be a signal about what you truly felt and it was your body’s way of expressing it. It might feel random but our emotions are strongly tied to our thoughts too – in this case, I would think it made sense for the way you responded given what you felt and experienced before, and feeling how history is repeating itself too, I’m guessing.
It sounds like your emotions were acting as a messenger – I’m wondering what it’s trying to tell you. I wonder if there might had been one very clear or strong emotion being felt or that it could’ve been a mixture of several different ones? Whatever it is, your emotions was and is valid, and that it’s only natural for you to have experienced it. Now what you can do is to try and see what’s behind those emotions –as in, what kind of thoughts are driving them, is there something that is not being met or got taken away from you? That could clue you in towards what you’re actually seeking out. Look for patterns or any common theme(s). The more you understand your emotions, the more actions (like you correctly pointed out: action plans!) you can take to meet your needs.
Additionally, it could be helpful to speak to a professional for some assistance, perhaps you can consider Family Service Centres . They can provide a safe space to help you process your feelings and to come up with some ideas to help you deal with what you’re experiencing. Regarding screening for depressed mood or anxious feelings, you can check this out for more information – I think it’s helpful to find out more to better understand your condition.
I’m glad to hear that you’re putting your mental health as a top priority. I hear you when you say it must’ve been difficult to go on, with life no less. It must feel scary and lonely too so I want you to know that I’m here to listen if you’d like to share more. I also want to remind you to take care of yourself! That starts with getting enough rest, nutrition, care, joy, exercise, compassion, companionship, etc. - anything that helps you through the day!

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us here, I hear you, and it’s completely understandable that the thought of being admitted to IMH is unsettling for you, especially considering the strong bonds you have with your husband and fur kids. Starting a new job can be challenging, and it sounds like you’re going through a tough time right now.
Feeling like a failure is a heavy burden, but please know that you’re not alone in these struggles. It’s okay to acknowledge the difficulties and emotions you’re experiencing. As for the chest pains and breathing difficulties, it’s very important to take them seriously. While anxiety can indeed manifest physically, it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any other potential causes and ensure you receive the support and guidance you need.
I would suggest that you reach out to a mental health professional firstly, to help you manage the root of the anxiety that you are experiencing. You can try walking in or calling the nearby Family Service Centre, or you can try a polyclinic near your home that has mental health assistance to guide you.
In the meantime, I would also suggest that you try these tools that we have which can help you, but in the long run we still recommend that you see a mental health professional to work on the deeper issues.

The subject of this post might not seem like much but I’ve been asking myself whether it’s part of a larger problem. Is it normal to keep feeling like checking my phone and notifications whenever I feel the urge to? To feel antsy and stressed about little things, and to always have this lingering doubt/premonition in my mind that something may go wrong somewhere/somehow? I have a feeling this is directly linked to not being able to stop checking my phone, but I don’t know how to fix it. I want to put down my phone and feel better, eliminate this constant worry from my mind, but nowadays it’s getting harder and harder. Talking to friends and family helps but afterwards the feeling comes back again, and it just continuously bugs me. Another thing is sometimes my heart beats really fast when this sense of anxiousness comes back, and I just want a break from it, to calm down, to not worry about everything for once. I think a lot of it comes from doubt and stress from relationships, but I just want to feel better. I understand that exercise helps with regulating emotions, but recently I have been pretty busy too so there’s not much time left for exercising or going to the gym. I feel that getting some help from professionals or experienced individuals and having a conversation can also help. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this?",,2,,,,,

For example I got so worried and frustrated when I realised I missed one of my quizzes although it was only 2% of the overall grade I think a lot of these thoughts piled on and I ended up deciding to go and see a councillor to organise my thoughts a little.
Also it can be difficult to find time to do hardcore exercise but maybe can try incorporating smaller exercises thru out the day like climbing stairs or alighting 1 stop earlier and walking home with your phone turned off its not going to help you lose weight fast but being consistent can help in the long run

Thanks for working up the courage to share about this. I would personally say that your subject line is VERY valid given how you’ve described what you’re going through – with your thoughts and feelings, and what is compelling you to do about it when you’re constantly worried. I’m also wondering whether with school comes with it a set of expectations, perhaps from those around you or yourself even?
There seems to be some thoughts (you mentioned, “something may go wrong somewhere/somehow”) and reactions (“feel antsy and stressed”, “heart beats really fast”), and this kinda puts you into some action that should lead to some positive outcome/relief (maybe like checking your phone and other things too?). I’m guessing this urge to check the notifications helps during the moment but what happens if you don’t engage in this? I think it’ll just make you more worried, right? This worrying feels like an unhelpful cycle that keeps getting more and more…and you’re like how do I just get out of it…
I also see that you wonder if this worry can be eliminated, cause that can definitely help with what’s going on. I wonder it’s fully possible to do that, I think that worrying, the kind that’s not debilitating or all-consuming still has some use, like making sure I keep a look out for real threats or letting me know that I’ve gotta do something about this anxious-provoking event? Maybe your worry has some sort of a function here? Did something happen recently? What about the notifications that you’re looking out for? What larger problem are you referring to?
Additionally, I can see you taking steps in the right direction – like reaching out, knowing the benefits of exercising, and, just trying to regulate your emotions. In the meanwhile, when things get a bit overwhelming for you, perhaps you can try this exercise in a comfortable and safe space as it helps to refocus on the present moment by shifting focus away from anxious feelings. You can also consider this list should you feel like giving professional assistance a try!

7536,Body Image Issues,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/body-image-issues/7536,Is This Normal?,---,6039,jinx,User,,10692,1,"Hi there! I’m currently a student who just started school and I’ve been dealing with body image issues for a few years now. Sometimes I miss the good old days when I didn’t really care, but now it’s always on my mind and it’s been bugging me for quite some time. I was overweight a few years back and some comments were made about my body, and I wasn’t really comfortable with it. However, I didn’t think much about it back then. That was till I found out someone very close and important to me also made the same comments before, and this really affected me. I started becoming extremely conscious of what I looked like in the mirror, such that every single time I walked past a mirror I would look into it and feel bad about how I looked. I would be filled with self-doubt and my thoughts would always be self-deprecating. To be honest, I just didn’t like how my body looked at that point in time. That was when I started to cut down on food by extreme lengths. At first, I would eat less rice, or less meat, but then it gradually got worse to the point where I ate only vegetables for meals and sometimes 2 or even 1 meal a day. I even went to the gym, sometimes twice a day. This led to an unhealthy cut-down of weight, leading me to lose more than 10kg in the span of 1.5 months. By that time, I thought I would be happy with my body, and I thought all my concerns would fade, and it was true. For a period of time, I became happy about my body, and I liked the way I looked, though I understood fully how unhealthy the route I took to achieve it was. But slowly, I relapsed to my old ways and started looking in the mirror again, scolding myself for the littlest of things. Sometimes I would feel very bloated after a meal and feel self-conscious about it, thinking I had put on weight again even if it’s just water weight. I would regularly check myself in the mirror to see whether I’ve gained weight anywhere, to see if I might return to the body type I was before the entire weight-loss journey. That was a constant fear, a constant worry in my mind. In current day, I’m still a little insecure. There’s still a lot of things surrounding this that’s on my mind. For instance, my parents would always call me “too skinny”, or tell me to “eat more” and “gain weight”, but when I look in the mirror, that is not the image that I see. This makes me really confused. Am I really what I see in the mirror? Or am I what people say about me? People said that I was fat before, and now they either praise or scold me for being too skinny, but in the mirror I would always see something different. I would always doubt in the end. Is this normal? What can I do about it?",,2,,,,,
7536,Body Image Issues,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/body-image-issues/7536,Is This Normal?,---,3690,cottonsoul,Professional,Professional,10695,2,"Hi @jinx
Thank you for opening up about your experiences with body image concerns. It takes courage to share such personal struggles, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.
It sounds like you’ve been on a challenging journey, and the impact of comments about your body, especially from someone close to you, has deeply affected your self-perception. The cycle of extreme dieting, exercise, and self-criticism can be emotionally and physically exhausting, so it does make sense to feel the way you do right now.
It’s common for people with body image issues to experience confusion about their self-perception, especially when faced with conflicting comments from others. The reality is that how you see yourself may not always align with others’ perceptions, and that’s okay. It’s important to prioritize your own feelings and well-being rather than seeking external validation.
What you’re describing is not uncommon, and it can be helpful to explore these feelings with a mental health professional, such as a counselor or therapist. They can provide support and coping strategies to process through these complex emotions and develop a healthier relationship with your body
I encourage you to develop a balanced and sustainable approach to nutrition and exercise, which can contribute to both physical and mental health. Additionally, discussing your concerns openly with your parents or other trusted individuals in your life might help them better understand your perspective and provide more supportive feedback.
Remember, your worth is not solely determined by your appearance, and seeking professional help can be a good step toward building a healthier and more positive relationship with your body and self-image.

You mentioned experiencing panic attacks, which can be distressing. Have you considered reaching out to a mental health professional who can support you? They can help you explore coping strategies and work through these overwhelming emotions. For example if you’re in a school setting, you can actually approach your school counsellor to discuss these feelings and find ways to cope. There are also nearby Family Service Centres which have in-house counsellors to help guide you along the way.

Afterwards, I got so scared of people that I stayed at home for a year. My family just thought that I was lazy and kept nagging at me. I’ve told them before about my situation but they just told me to suck it up. Finally, last year I decided to pluck up the courage and forced myself to get employed again. It was all going well until now.
Nothing excites me anymore, I’m just on autopilot everyday. I don’t feel happy from anything and I just feel kind of down with a small anxiety pooling in my stomach(don’t know how else to describe it). I also seem to tear up easily.
Also, I can’t seem to wake up on time when my alarm clock rings and I just want to keep lying in bed because I don’t want to go to work.
After work when I reach home, I have no motivation to do anything. For example, if I were to drop a sweet wrapper on the floor, I can’t seem to pick it up, I just look at it and leave it there.
Normally playing games would have gave me some sort of happiness and give me a boost of motivation in life but lately I can’t seem to find the joy in it anymore.

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles, and I’m truly sorry to hear that you’ve been through such challenging experiences, and I appreciate you opening up about what you’re currently going through. It sounds like you’ve faced a lot of difficulties, and it’s completely valid to feel the way you do. Dealing with bullying in both school and work can have a huge impact on a person’s well-being, and it takes a lot of strength to push through.
It must be incredibly tough to have your family misunderstand your situation, adding to the emotional weight you’re carrying. Feeling numb, anxious, and lacking motivation are all difficult emotions to process, and it’s okay to acknowledge that.
It sounds like you’ve been trying your best to push through and find joy in activities that used to bring you happiness, like playing games. You know, sometimes the things that once brought us joy may not have the same effect during times that we’re struggling with, it just doesn’t feel the same.
Your feelings of exhaustion and difficulty in facing the day are valid, and I want you to know that you don’t have to go through this alone. Seeking support from friends, family, or even a mental health professional could be helpful. I encourage you to speak to a mental health professional who can help you to process what you’re going through.

Thanks for this question and sharing how you feel about your situation. You have a whole lot of self-awareness for someone your age – I respect you for that! – and I can see how you’re super worried about the future when it comes to losing your parents, especially your mother. Your worry seems to serve a function here – I wonder if it’s to protect you from the future loss (by giving you a sense of control) but at the same time, it also takes away precious time and energy to do other things you could be doing with your mother. This is a pretty existential question that got me thinking a lot too! But I think it helps if I zoom back down to what’s important instead of being drifted away by all the other what-if questions it provokes!
A person can be grateful for the care they receive and at the same time be upset that they might not get anymore one day. You can spend your time and effort worrying about the future that isn’t here yet or spend your time and effort doing things you love with your parents! Cause you seem to have figured out that gratitude (a.k.a. being thankful ) could be the key for you here so let’s try to see how you can include it in your day-to-day:
- Journaling about anything (moments, people, aspects of your life) that you are grateful for. Try to aim for at least ten items on your list.
- Thinking of a time when you were in a difficult situation that you were able to solve - then appreciate having overcome it
- WWW (what went well): reflect on what went well for you, especially if you had a bad day
- Share your gratitude: Thank someone who did something good and explain what you are grateful to them for.
Don’t cringe but tomorrow is a mystery while today is a gift and that’s why we call it the present!
As for your sleep, perhaps you can start with the below helpful habits:
- Expose yourself to bright sunlight in the mornings to tune your body’s circadian clock
- Regular exercise to tire yourself out
- Reduce late-night eating/avoid caffeine
- Put on relaxing scents/no gadgets before bedtime
- Adjust the room temperature/darken the room
- Tell yourself to postpone any worries by stating, “That’s all for tonight”
- Get out of bed if you still can’t sleep and do light activities (stretch, pet your pet)

This must not have been an easy thing to share, so thank you for finding the courage to share what you’re currently going through! I hear you when you say you find it hard to express how you feel and dealing with others especially since you prefer to be by yourself.
First off, I wanna share that emotions probably contain some sort of a message. For example:
- Sadness signals loss of something valuable or disappointment towards yourself/others
- Anger signals an unfair treatment/boundaries being crossed
- Scared signals a present threat that needs escaping from
This might help you see why you feel a certain way - especially if it happens repeatedly, kinda like in a pattern (like towards a particular person/place/event)
Second, as you correctly mention, feelings gotta be communicated in a way that is helpful and at an intensity that is appropriate. For me:
- Sadness can be expressed through crying/talking to someone I trust
- Anger can be expressed rationally instead of being acted upon immediately; so I might get outside/go for a run to cool off first
- Scared can be expressed safely by being mindful of the fear and engaging someone I trust
This can also help you manage relationships cause by being clear with what you think and how you feel, you’re able to get what you need through your actions (match to their style in terms of how much you wanna share, how well they know you, etc.)
2. Know what you want
3. Say what you want clearly
4. Others clearly know what you want
It’s not about suddenly being OK with everyone but being OK with the people you want to be OK with (those that matter to you). Now, I’m gonna circle back to your question on avoidant attachment style, I’m curious to know more about the part(s) that resonate with you the most. I’m also heartened that it sounds like you wanna work on it. Perhaps this info on avoidant attachment style matches (although not necessarily needing to be 100%) your growing up experience and they way you view how people tend to speak to/respond to/treat you. What’s helpful here is that learning more about this particular style would give you insight into what might help you – in this case, engaging with people more but being AWARE of the fact that it will be scary/potentially unpleasant AND knowing that something can be done to make it LESS scary/unpleasant!
So how to make it less uncomfortable? Well, it starts with being kind to yourself as you notice your reactions when you need to approach people, notice when you act out/withdraw when you start to feel scared/pushed away, notice and pay attention to those that really want to interact/support you as that helps build on you feeling OK to connect to others. Do give this a try and let us know how else we can continue to support you!

Sometimes when we are interacting with the people we are comfortable with or holding on to negative emotions for too long it might be difficult to filter our emotions and lead to us unloading the full brunt of our raw emotions which might end up hurting them.
Some tips I learned when these situations happen are:
2. When we realise that we are feeling angry/sad take a moment pause, go to a safe space and breathe recognise what you are feeling. (Take as long as you need )
3. Recognise that you are not upset at the person but the situation it self. Try to use words that describe how you feel for example, ‘I feel this way because I need some space now/want some alone time, hope you can understand.’ The key is to talk about how you are feeling and how the situation is making you feel.
Does this help ? Perhaps what are some examples which trigger those negative emotions ?",,1,,10516,,10516.0,

I don’t like loud noises and can get overwhelmed if there’s too many things to process at once, like if multiple people talking or a lot of noise, or both, sometimes I just run away but I’m trying to learn to cope and calm myself down, its hard for me to just ignore and focus on one thing, it works for a while then im just overwhelmed again. I also hate it when people raise their voices or when I raise my own, it leads into arguements.

I’m scared to make friends, I’d prefer for them to approach me but not much luck.

First off, thanks so much for sharing about what you’re going through at this moment and letting us get to know you better. I wanna let you know that whatever you’re thinking and feeling about your whole situation is valid. I think that it’s great you’re seeing someone to work on yourself (you mentioned that it’s for PTSD, I hope that sessions with your therapist is helping you out). I also want to take a step back to let you know that you did (say: removing yourself from a situation where it was too loud/overwhelming for you) what you had to do at that point to feel safe and alright. If I were to see things from your lens, I would do whatever it is just to get out of the really upsetting situation – I guess that’s how you were trying to make sense of what’s going on around you and probably inside of you… But I can also sense that you want to work on it as some of those behaviours (trying to escape, not engaging with people) seem to be holding you back and you want to cope better.
You’re looking to cope better in things and it got me wondering about future transitions that awaits you. There’s this info on stages that could be helpful. It might not be an exact guide but can serve as a resource to understand what you’re going through especially with growing up, how you feel about yourself, who you identify as, etc.
As for getting a diagnosis for Autism Spectrum Disorder, I’m sure you have some thoughts so I wonder how you feel about it? Have you had the chance to speak to someone about it…like just to share your thoughts? I find that speaking to someone I feel comfortable with makes it feel like I’m not on this on my own cause it’s a pretty big deal to maybe get a diagnosis that tries to explain why I might be the way I am. If that’s hard to do, maybe can consider writing down your thoughts and feelings, just to get a sense of (different) perspective when you see it on paper VS being in your head.
I’m sure you’re also curious about the autism assessment, here’s what it might look like . It might not be 100% same but it should give you an idea about the process and what might happen in the assessment – the professional will likely be able to make sense of the symptoms based on what you’re gonna share.
In the meantime, to help you cope, you can consider doing some of these self-care activities (if you haven’t already):
• Regular exercise
• Get healthy and regular meals
• Get hydrated
• Prioritise restful sleep
• Engage in a relaxing activity
• Set goals/priorities
• Practice gratitude
• Focus on positivity
• Stay connected
• You can add on things to this list!

I think it’s around when I was ten, I started to notice my parents would fight often. And every time they do, the problem was never resolved because their focus are mainly on proving their point. After that, they would not talk for a couple of days and then they would act like nothing happened. During my teenage years, my mom would open up to me about how dad would belittle her in front of people if he couldn’t have what he wanted with her. He would scold her if she made a mistake but held back his praises if she did something well with the family business. All in all he was not a safe place for her.
I think the same can be said for myself as well. He was pretty absent in my life now that I think about it. Even on weekends, he would either be at the teahouse with his friends or doing something. I don’t remember a single time me sharing my day with him or him sharing his with me. The most vivid memories I have of him are the times him scolding me. I suppose the blame is on me as well since I did not try to connect enough with him.
According to my mom, he’s not all that bad since he’s not an alcoholic or a gambler. And that he’s good at doing business and supports the family well. And I agree with her. Yes, to a certain extent he is somewhat of a father and a provider. Even now I can recall bits and pieces of him teaching me how to swim, how to ride a bike and him saying “That’s my girl” when I do well in my academics. But compared to all the bad memories I have of him, the good memories are like a grain of sand on a beach.
Lately, my parents’ marriage is deteriorating more than ever. With both me and my brother moving out to study abroad, they had no reason to hold back anymore. According to my mom, they had not been intimate for a long time. And very recently, she shared that he had been talking to someone online. Right now, I am not sure if talking counts as cheating or not but mom said that she wouldn’t mind if it’s just chatting online and that she would only confront him if he gets physical and that as family we have to uphold his dignity in our circle. And since fathers are softer towards daughters, I should be the one to hold him back.
Right now, I am very confused and angry. Why should mom or us be the ones to protect his dignity when he’s the one crossing the line? If he is thinking about me or my brother at all he would not be doing all this in the first place. When I told those to my mother she said that I am young and inexperienced and that I should not put my pride first in a marriage and that I should try to see the good in him. I am trying really trying to see my dad in a good light, but it is so difficult with everything happening throughout our entire family life. He is not all that bad but he’s not good as well and the most frustrating part is that he is not trying to be better. For him, he’s never wrong and he’s the head of the family so he knows best. So here are my questions-
- Are all marriages and families supposed to be like this? There was a time I believed that “one big happy family” concepts like the ones in movies is possible but seeing this not only in my family but also in my relatives and everywhere around me, am I just being naive?
- With everything I’m going through, do I need therapy? How can I know whether I really need therapy or just being dramatic over a bad bump in our family life or am I having victim complex?
- If I were to encounter a similar situation as my mom in my marriage, should I be prideful like I am right now or find reasons to stay in the name of keeping the family together?",,2,10499.0,,,,

Thank you for sharing about what you’ve been through – it sounds like a lot and I’m going to try my best to address your questions. First up, I want to say that you have a lot of insight into your situation and that parenting should not need to run on conditions (e.g., hold back praises, “I know best”, etc.). This just sends mixed signals about how to respond to a person and also leads to certain needs not being met (e.g., support, comfort, growth) within the family. At the same time, your thoughts and feelings given the situation are valid! I would imagine feeling lost, confused, angry, upset – although you’ve been saddled with these for a very long time (i.e., ‘studying abroad’ – ten years old). It must’ve been very difficult having to cope with this alongside being a teenager! Whatever you’re doing to keep yourself going – keep doing that!
Additionally, I find that being told to be the one “to hold him back” is going to be so tough on you to decide what to do. It almost sounds to me like you’re being triangulated. What this means is that you’re being relied upon to communicate with your father. Although it can work in some cases by taking the load of the parent through a neutral 3rd party, it can also go the opposite direction – being dragged into the conflict and putting everyone in a lot of stress! Perhaps, trying to speak to your parents openly and in a safe space just to allow yourself to be heard can be something worth giving a shot.
As for your other questions, here’s what I think…
- I think that every marriage and family comes with its own idiosyncrasies and that perception can be reality. However, a family should provide each member with the basic need of support, comfort, love, shelter, and growth; and if it doesn’t then something needs to be changed.
- Therapy can be for a variety of reasons: from learning new skills to changing unhelpful behaviours to working on mental health conditions. Some people find that speaking to someone they trust can also bring about insight into their situations although some prefer to engage in a professional. The commonality here is that they can engage you in a non-judgmental manner (and dissect with you those burning questions you’re having) and potentially work together to come up with ways to cope. Also, this thread could be helpful for you to learn more about therapy.
- I wonder if you kinda have a feeling about the answer to this question. I mean, it does involve a lot of what-ifs and clashing of important values (staying together, happiness of all VS happiness of one, etc.). I’m not sure if you’ve tried listing down all the pros and cons to really weigh what’s most important to you; if not, you can give this a try.

I think every family is different and there isn’t one way that marriages and families should be. It also depends on what your definition of happy is.

Thank you for sharing with us what you’re currently experiencing. It sounds like you’re experiencing a powerful and complex emotional response, and it’s completely okay to feel that way. Nostalgia can be triggered by various stimuli, not just personal memories Sometimes, it’s the aesthetic or the atmosphere of certain places, sceneries, or even videos that can evoke a sense of familiarity or longing.
Emotions are indeed intricate and complex, and the way we connect with the world around us can be quite deep and profound. To help process these nostalgic feelings, you might consider reflecting on the following questions:
2. What specific elements or aspects of the sceneries, places, or videos trigger this nostalgic feeling for you? Is it the visuals, the atmosphere, or something else that resonates with you emotionally?
3. How do you think these nostalgic feelings connect to your current experiences or desires? Are there any unfulfilled aspects in your life that these emotions might be highlighting or reminding you of?
Sometimes, nostalgia can serve as a reminder of our desires, aspirations, or unfulfilled experiences. It’s okay to acknowledge and explore these feelings without judgment. If you find it difficult to process these emotions on your own, you can also try discussing them with a friend, family member, or a mental health professional who could provide additional insights and support for you
Remember, emotions are a natural part of the human experience, and your feelings are valid! It’s okay to take the time to understand and process them at your own pace. Do share with us your thoughts and reflections about these, and let us know how else we can support you.

I first experience these when I was studying in poly. Whenever there’s projects datelines or exams nearing and when I felt very stressed out, these feelings gets worse. I’m constantly overthinking, my mind just can’t stop the negative thoughts. I feel very suffocated like it’s hard to breathe most of the time and I feel very lonely even when I’m with my friends.
I tried talking to school advisor, family or friends but people always brush it off, that I’m just stress and I should just not think about it. I just gave up telling anyone about these anymore.

This must not have been an easy thing to share so thank you for finding the courage to submit this! Firstly, I want to acknowledge how you’re able to notice your patterns of behaviours when it comes to your anxious tendencies – it does sound like symptoms of anxiety and it’s taking a toll on your relationships, completing tasks, etc. for many years.
I wonder if you’re anxious feelings serves some sort of a purpose for your body to be engaged in it? Perhaps it’s a signal that something you value is being threatened; since it happens on and off and during certain times… In the meantime, whenever you feel stressed, perhaps you can give this exercise a try to see if it helps.
It also sounds like you know one of the ways to help yourself was to reach out to others. I’m sorry to hear that you got brushed off when you reached out to people (they probably aren’t as equipped to help ) so I’m heartened that you’re trying to work on this by getting professional assistance. You know, therapists will work with you in a non-judgmental manner and collaborate on a recovery plan that suits you. Below are a list of resources that you can check out if you’d like to consider besides a referral from polyclinic:
2. Samaritans of Singapore (1-767)
3. James Cook University Clinic
4. NIE Wellness Centre
5. NUS Clinical & Health Psychology Centre
I can see where you’re coming from when you say you don’t want your family to know about seeking counselling. However, I believe that the benefit of engaging your family and others close to you serves as a support system to provide social support, check-ins, healthy distraction – as you are not in this on your own! At first, it will seem daunting to make the changes and involve others, but this is a necessary step in recovery as having people to reach out to does reduce anxiety and improve coping abilities with stress.

Thank you for sharing with us your feelings and struggles, and I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through a difficult time. It’s common for people to experience different emotions in various settings, such as feeling energetic and happy around others but then losing energy and struggling with sleep when alone. This could be a manifestation of anxiety or other underlying issues.
It sounds like you’re experiencing a very clear contrast in your emotions between being at school and being at home. This shift in mood can be difficult to process, and it’s understandable that it’s taking a toll on your energy and well-being.
I would like to offer some possible insights for this situation:
2. Social Anxiety and Coping Mechanisms: It’s very normal for people with social anxiety to feel more comfortable in structured environments like school. The presence of routines, familiar faces, and clear expectations can contribute to a sense of security. On the other hand, the change in environment and the absence of those factors at home might trigger feelings of fatigue and sadness.
3. Emotional Exhaustion: Constantly maintaining a positive and energetic demeanor, especially if it’s not your natural state, can be emotionally exhausting! It’s possible that when you return home, your body and mind are trying to recover from the exertion of managing social interactions throughout the day, hence the low energy.
4. Routine and Transition: The transition from one environment to another can be emotionally taxing. At school, you might be occupied with activities and people, but returning home may trigger a sense of loneliness or solitude. Establishing a comforting routine at home might help with this transition
5. Potential Stressors: Reflect on any specific stressors or concerns that you may be facing at home, as these could contribute to the shift in mood. It could be helpful to identify and address any underlying issues causing you distress too.
Considering the complexity of emotions, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional, such as a school counselor, who can provide support for you. He/She can help you to explore the underlying causes of these emotional shifts and offer coping strategies that can help meet your needs.
Remember that seeking help is a sign of strength! Do reach out to your school counsellor and keep us updated on how it’s going for you. Hear from you soon.",,0,,10396,,10396.0,

My boss finally told me the reason why I’m still unpaid is due to my company’s clients not paying it fully and clients have gone through other graphic design agencies. And because of this, it made me and my girlfriend’s relationship crumbling slowly. And now, even when me and my girlfriend texted every day and call each other every night, before she moved out of her house she used home wifi, but after she moved out she had to rely on her cellular data, I’m worried that when I’m not receiving salary anymore and telling her that again and again she’ll never be happy about it, even I told her already on this first phase of her understanding me.
We’ve been together for about 3 years and yes we had fights before but it’s natural since all types of couples fight naturally, no matter what time and situation’s going to be. But however I’m at the point where that one time me and my girlfriend exchange love reassurance banters while she mentions about my cat (in a joking way, like giving my cat a transport just to see my girlfriend) I tried calling her on video call and she picked up just to see my cat until it’s done and I ask her if she had enough mobile data but she just said if she didn’t have enough mobile data, just end the call, but even I can’t tell whether she’s joking or not but I tried to be understanding of her and just to say I end the call and we resume on text message so I just did which I thought it’ll be better, but now she threw a fit on me saying “wait you really hang up the call?! You don’t love me! I don’t want you” But I replied her text message saying “no no no I didn’t mean to do that, I hang up because I’m concerned how much mobile data do you have right now” and I tried calling her multiple times even on video or voice but she rejected my calls so many times. And she ghosted me the next day as she had all the time to play around with her facebook app. I sent series of text messages to her apologizing but she never even read them even there’s no bluetick. I can’t think anything else negatively that she might change her privacy settings. I didn’t want this to fall apart just because I want to conserve her mobile data even I said it clearly on call. I never abruptly end my phone call at all.
Part of me wishes her house had an internet wifi by her sister or I finally got paid after 2 months of no payment. Even now my relationship feels like falling apart because of my boss and his company not paying me on time. It’s so saddening.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to share with us your struggles. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a tough time. It sounds incredibly challenging, both professionally at work, and personally. The situation with your boss not paying you on time must be very frustrating and stressful. It’s understandable that this is affecting your relationship, and I can see that you care deeply about your girlfriend.
It’s important to communicate openly with her, even though it seems like there may be some miscommunication. When you can express your concerns and explain the situation regarding your salary, perhaps it may help her understand the challenges you’re facing right now. Let her know that you value her and your relationship, and that you’re working to resolve these issues. I understand that at this point she might not be responding to you, and I can imagine the pain of being rejected. Perhaps you could give her awhile more to cool down, and you can try contacting her again. Alternatively, you could also find other ways to contact her - like through her sister, or family home number as well.
Relationships can face difficulties, and I know that you want to make things right. Continue to reassure her that your intention was never to upset her during the phone call, and you were genuinely trying to be considerate of her mobile data. Give her some time, but continue to express your feelings and apologize for any misunderstanding.
I hope that both your professional and personal situations improve soon. Please continue to keep us updated on how you’re coping. Hear from you soon.",,0,,10401,,10401.0,

Another time was when I was in thailand buying tickets for an exhibit then I suddenly forgot about receiving change right after I was handed change by the staff. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep or stress but that really shook me for awhile.
There are times where the magnitude of such situations were not as bad for example heading towards the kitchen for a drink then suddenly forgetting why i was there in the first place until a few moments later I snap back.

Thank you for taking the time to share your struggles and worries with us here. I want to affirm you that it’s actually quite common for people to experience occasional forgetfulness, especially during times of stress, lack of sleep, or distraction. However, persistent concerns about memory loss can be distressing. Also I’d like you to note that occasional lapses in memory don’t necessarily indicate dementia, as there can be various reasons for forgetfulness.
Here are a few considerations as to why you might be forgetting things recently:
2. Stress and Lack of Sleep: Both stress and lack of sleep can significantly impact cognitive function and memory. If you’ve been experiencing high levels of stress or have a disrupted sleep pattern, addressing these factors may lead to improvements in your memory.
3. Age-Related Memory Changes: As people age, it’s normal to experience changes in memory. However, significant memory loss and cognitive decline are not a normal part of aging. If you’re concerned, please do consult with a healthcare professional for a proper assessment.
4. Healthy Lifestyle: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can contribute to better cognitive function. This includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, proper hydration, and adequate sleep. Physical activity has been linked to improved cognitive health!
5. Mental Stimulation: Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as puzzles, reading, or learning new skills, can help keep your brain active and may contribute to better memory.
6. Medical Check-Up: If you have persistent concerns about your memory, it’s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional. They can perform a thorough evaluation, taking into consideration your medical history, lifestyle factors, and conduct any necessary tests to assess your cognitive function.
While occasional forgetfulness is common, significant or worsening memory issues should be discussed with a healthcare professional such as a doctor. They can help determine the underlying causes and provide guidance on any necessary steps for improvement or management.
Remember that anxiety about memory can itself contribute to feelings of forgetfulness, so addressing your concerns with a healthcare professional can provide reassurance and support

I had a feeling for a while now that my mother is not mentally well. She is very paranoid and thinks that everyone is ganging up on her and she starts scolding and saying nasty things about others when no one is actually doing anything to her. She would take every little things from what people say to what they do as a sign and that they are doing it to her and she would start saying nasty things about them even if she doesn’t know them. She also keeps bringing up the past again and again and is always angry and talk ■■■■ about everyone else and thinks that she’s the only good one. She is also very superstitious, she doesn’t like it when buying anything and someone packs it with a black plastic bag and anything black she finds fault with it, if my father brings home a black plastic bag she would scold him and start saying vulgarities and nasty things about his family and other people as well.
On good days, she is a little more tolerant and is a nice lady but she takes everything she hear to heart and will keep bringing it back up again and again.
I live apart from her for quite some time, we live in different countries and I would go to visit her once a year. She lives with my father and he is aware of these conditions as well, but have no way of convincing her to see a therapist. I do love her very much, but everytime I goes to visit, we would have a huge fight and she would behave crazier and crazier and it stresses me out a lot.
I don’t think I’m doing anything helpful for her, and it only makes things worse everytime. I tried to tolerate the way she talks and berate others, but I couldn’t hold it back and ultimately I snapped. I know that I am supposed to be more understanding and empathetic of her but I cannot bring myself to do that when I’m constantly hearing nasty things about other people when they have done nothing wrong. She would blame the whole world for their bad and she have even physically hurt others in the process of her rage. I know that it might not be her fault but I don’t understand why she would do this to others who have done nothing to her. She would also start scolding my father and say nasty and dirty things and she shows no respect for him and also her own family. It is really saddening for me to see this happen to my mother and I really want to help her but I don’t even know what is wrong with her. how should I help her?
I feel that on the side, I feel really stressed and tired of this situation. I myself may have been affected by all this, because although I made a decision to meet my parents every year, I feel anxious about it as I’m not sure when she would act up. I would really want to kill myself everytime this happens because I don’t want to feel, hear and think anymore. I really just want to end myself once and for all so that I will be rid of all these. I know this is not a very healthy thought, and I shouldn’t think of ending my life but I cannot help it. I reflected about how I had reacted to her fits and I unknowingly conflicted harm to my ownself and this may have hurt her feelings as during the whole situation I noticed that she was very rude but she sounded really sad. That’s why I would like to know how do I help myself first and how do I help my mother.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your struggles and frustrations with us, I commend you for your courage.
To be a caregiver and manage your mother’s current mental health struggles is truly difficult, and it makes sense to feel stressed and confused about how to help her. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult and challenging situation in your family. I want you to know that you are not alone, and there are ways to seek help and support for both yourself and your mother.
2. Encourage Professional Help for Your Mother: While it’s challenging to convince her to seek help, perhaps expressing your concern and explaining how her behavior affects you and the family may be a starting point. Offer support rather than judgment. If possible, try to involve your father in this conversation to create a united front.
3. Contact someone from the Community Outreach Teams (CREST – Community Resource Engagement and Support Team) & Community Intervention Teams (COMIT): They can help to assess your mother’s condition at the home itself if need be. Do reach out to them for direct assistance. This is the list of providers - do take a look at see which one is nearest to your mother’s home. You can read more here: How and Where To Get Help For Mental Health Conditions - Agency for Integrated Care
4. Take care of your mental health: Explore self-help strategies to manage your own stress and anxiety. This may include mindfulness practices, exercise, breathing activities, and seeking support from friends or a mental health professional.

I would say we are having a platonic relationship(office best friend), as we are really close but I never once cross the boundary since she is in a long-term relationship with her BF. I never once go out with her afterwork alone. We only went out together as a group with other colleagues.
The only thing we did is have lunch together during work hours, usually together with other colleagues. We talk during office hours and at one point we are texting each other after work hours. Maybe that cross the boundary, and she kinda stop replying my message after work hours, so I respect that.
Now recently, I kinda piss her off by calling her fat in a joking way. Since then she has been giving me the cold shoulder, and started talking to other guy colleague and going gym with him. For context, she talks to everyone in the office whether is it guy or girl. She is a social butterfly.
When I found out that she has been talking to him. I don’t know why I feel this strong jealous emotion. Now what I want to know is from your point of view, am I jealous because I have feelings for her? Or am I jealous because “I am her guy best friend and I am being replaced”?

Thank you for taking the time to share your struggles. It’s understandable that you’re trying to make sense of your emotions in this situation. Jealousy can be a complex and multifaceted emotion, and it’s great that you’re reflecting on it.
In your case, it’s possible that the jealousy is stemming from a few different sources:
2. Feeling Replaced: You mentioned that you’ve been close with your colleague, and her recent interactions with another male colleague may make you feel like you’re being replaced in terms of friendship or camaraderie.
3. Realization of Attachment: It’s also possible that, over time, you developed a level of attachment to your colleague beyond just a platonic friendship. The realization that she’s connecting with someone else on a personal level might be triggering these emotions. You might need to explore more on this area to gain more clarity.
4. Reflecting on Boundaries: The incident where you jokingly called her fat and it led to her distancing herself could have highlighted the importance of respecting boundaries. This might be making you question the dynamics of your relationship with her.
Understanding the root cause of your jealousy can be helpful in addressing and managing these emotions. It might be helpful to reflect on your own feelings and perhaps have an open and honest conversation with your colleague. However, I can imagine it might be a sensitive time, so you could consider approaching the conversation with sensitivity and respect for her feelings and boundaries.
Remember, it’s okay to feel emotions, including jealousy, but what matters is how you choose to handle and address those emotions If you find that your feelings are becoming challenging to manage, seeking support from friends, family, or even a counselor can provide valuable perspectives and coping strategies.
If you do need to speak to a mental health professional or a relationship counsellor to help you through this period, do feel free to talk to anyone in the nearest Family Service Centre or speak to someone online too:

Happy new year! Would like to express my thanks. Reading your advice really helps to my piece my emotions together.
So the next day, I reflected on myself and realise for the whole year I am always complaining to her about my job. And I realise, it must be really tiring to hear this. Since, it is Xmas I have decided to buy a gift and express my thanks as a friend. Instead of feeling bad and jealous, I decided to express gratitude and I like it.
The gift is well received and she buy me a gift too. She express that I am her first friend and office besties. Reading the card makes me happy. Now I’m quite sure a huge percentage of jealously is fear of being replaced as the office best friend. And a small percentage of I might have developed a tiny bit attraction to her which I know it should not happen. We are just really good friends. I want to keep it that way.
So right now I am trying to not to over think as she did claim that there is nothing going on between her and her gym buddy (someone is spreading rumours in the office). And she also told me how she is spending time with her current bf. The weird thing is I am not jealous of her bf! In fact I am happy for her.
Right now, everything is back to normal. We are chatting. Question is how do I stop this toxic thinking? It’s not healthy for me, even for my future r/s, I don’t want to be an overthinker. Even now when I saw her go gym with her with her gym buddy kinda makes me feel abit of jelaousy (not as much as my initial post) and I overthink different scenarios .

Thanks for sharing more details, I appreciate the openness. It’s great that you’ve taken steps to express gratitude and maintain a positive dynamic with your friend. It’s also commendable that you recognize the potential for toxic thinking and want to address it.
Here are some strategies to help you manage and redirect those thoughts:
2. Challenge Negative Thoughts:
- When you catch yourself overthinking or feeling jealous, challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself if they are based on facts or assumptions. You can look for evidence that contradicts the negative thoughts.
*Try our tool to reframe your thoughts here: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Focus on Gratitude:
- Regularly practice gratitude to shift your mindset toward positive aspects of your life. You can also reflect on the positive qualities of your friendship and the positive experiences you share.
4. Set Boundaries:
- Establish clear boundaries for yourself & recognize when you’re investing too much emotional energy into scenarios that may not be realistic. Do remember that friendships can evolve, and it’s okay to have other connections as well.
5. Distract Yourself:
- Engage in activities that you enjoy and that can take your mind off negative thoughts. You can focus on hobbies, work, or other aspects of your life too.
Remember, managing these thoughts is an ongoing process, and it’s okay to seek professional help if you find it challenging to process them on your own. Developing a healthier mindset takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself too!

I can see that you’re experiencing a deep need for care and validation and I want to assure you that these feelings of wanting to be validated are indeed valid.

For example, you could reaching out to friends, family, or a mental health professional who can provide a more constructive and supportive outlet for your feelings. You can also share with them about your need for validation and explain to them how you would like to be validated. In some ways, you can also share your love language with them and ask them to show you love and care through that language that you feel loved.

Thank you for sharing with us more details about what’s been going on for you. I appreciate the honesty and I commend you for that.
I hear that your past feelings for the older person / teacher also contributed to your need for validation and you also experienced struggles with your sexual identity as well. I want to affirm you that these feelings of confusion and frustrations and the need for validation are completely normal and it happens to all of us too.
We may not know the exact reason for the strong desires for validation, but I’m glad that you are aware of it and you can now work towards managing it in a safe and healthy manner. When it comes to proving yourself or needing validation, it’s always good to have some form of self-affirming or self-validating stand as the foundation of who we are. This means that for a start, instead of seeking validation from external environment such as people around us, we should try to validate our own self internally.
Self-validation is a foundational aspect of building a healthy sense of self-worth and confidence. Here are some strategies to help you validate yourself:
2. Practice Self-Compassion:
- Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, especially during difficult times.
- Acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes, and it’s okay not to be perfect.
3. Positive Affirmations:
- Use positive affirmations to challenge negative thoughts and reinforce positive beliefs about yourself.
- For example, say things like “I am worthy,” “I am capable,” or “I deserve happiness.”
4. Focus on Strengths:
- Identify your strengths and talents. Acknowledge and appreciate what you excel at.
- Use your strengths to overcome challenges and build your confidence.
5. Learn from Mistakes:
- Instead of dwelling on mistakes, view them as opportunities for growth and learning.
- Analyze what went wrong, find lessons, and apply them to future situations.
Last but not least, if you can, please do reach out to a mental health professional who can help to facilitate the process of self-validation and help you build your sense of self. Remember that self-validation is a process, and I encourage you to recognize that your worth is not determined by the opinions or approval of others.

Me mental health was extremely poor a few years ago. Every attempt i made to get help only led to bad experiences and I gave up seeking help.
It hasnt been easy. I started talking to a counsellor who convinced me to get my parents involved (I’m a minor). Counsellor told me that they (counsellor) were worried I’m slipping back into depression rather quickly and am showing signs of anxiety, especially after something happened that very obviously triggered me and amplified my symptoms that havent gone away since they came a few years ago.
I’m terrified of behind hurt again by people who are supposed to help me when I’m vulnerable. Everything has been really hard but the thought of seeking help at the psychiatric services in hospitals has been really overwhelming.

Thank you for taking the time to share your struggles with us here, I hear you, and it sounds like you’ve been through a lot, facing challenges that no one should have to endure alone. I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to reach out and express these concerns. Trust in mental health care is really important, and it’s completely understandable that you might feel hesitant given your past experiences.
It’s disheartening when seeking help doesn’t bring the support and understanding one needs. It takes strength to continue reaching out despite previous setbacks. I’m so sorry to hear that your past attempts haven’t been positive, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.
In considering the idea of seeking help through psychiatric services in hospitals, it’s natural to feel overwhelmed, especially when reading about potential delays in appointments and assessments. The waiting process can indeed be challenging, and it’s completely okay to feel frustrated by it - I would feel the same way too!
I want to encourage you that every person’s journey is unique, and what matters most is finding the right support for you. If you’re open to it, discussing your concerns with your counselor or another mental health professional could be a helpful next step. They can help explore alternative options or push for a more expedited process.
While I can’t guarantee specific outcomes, I encourage you to communicate openly with your current support system (like counsellor, family) and explore all available avenues. Trust is something that can be rebuilt over time, and your well-being is a priority. That being said, do know that we are here to listen and support you but should there be a time for you to seek professional services, do approach anyone from a nearby Family Service Centre or speak to someone online here:

My parents divorced when I was 10. I think because of that, I had to grow up fast and also I didn’t really know how to express myself in that sense.
Sometimes, I feel like care too much and love too much, be it in friendships or relationships to the point that I hurt myself emotionally. Once, someone told me I needed help because I was sharing my problems and that hurt me. Due to that, I stopped sharing in detail and just gave surface levels information.
Now that I am in my 20s, I struggle a lot with expressing myself and I overthink a lot. As much as I like to say that I’ve tried to ‘lessen’ my overthinking, it seems like it’s getting bad over the years. However, I do try to have some me-time by reading to stop myself from overthinking. But sometimes, it doesn’t work.

Thank you for sharing with us your feelings and worries, we’re here to support you.
I’m truly sorry to hear about the challenges you’ve faced, especially with your parents’ divorce at a young age. I can tell that you’ve navigated through complex emotions and experiences, and I appreciate your openness in sharing your feelings.
It’s completely understandable that such early life experiences could shape your approach to relationships and self-expression. It sounds like you’ve developed a coping mechanism by turning to me-time activities like reading, and that’s commendable!
Here are some questions to think about, and share with us if you’re comfortable:
2. Have you considered talking to a professional, like a therapist or counselor, to explore and process the emotions related to your parents’ divorce and your challenges with expressing yourself?
3. Is there a specific aspect of overthinking that you find most challenging, and are there particular situations where it tends to be more pronounced?
Additionally, here are a couple of suggestions:
2. Reach out to close friends or family members whom you trust and feel comfortable with, gradually sharing more about your experiences. This might help create a support system that understands and encourages your emotional expression.
3. Consider researching local mental health resources or counseling services. Professionals in these fields can provide guidance and support as you navigate your journey of self-discovery and emotional well-being. There are some wonderful and affordable options out there, such as Family Service Centres and online options for counselling:

Thank you for sharing your worries with us! If I hear you correctly, it seems that you managed to trace your struggles of self-expression back to a particular incident, and I commend you for your introspection. I’m sorry that the incident made you hesitant to share with others due to the possibility of hurtful remarks, I can only imagine the tension that arises between wanting to lessen the burden of overthinking with not wanting to share too much.
Additionally, it sounds like you have a big heart for those around you, and it must’ve been really upsetting to care for others only to get hurt in the end Your kindness is very respectable, and I’m sorry if anyone has ever made you feel that you care ‘too much’
I really like how it sounds like you have been taking measures to counter this problem! When the thoughts get loud, it is completely understandable that sometimes reading or certain coping strategies may not be able to counter those thoughts, though it can get undeniably frustrating and helpless if you can’t take a break from constant thinking
I hope the resources that cottonsoul has shared would be a good starting point for your journey of help-seeking, if you intend to embark on it as mentioned in your post!

However, when I asked for a report like he did, the psychiatrist wrote me a signed letter to my parent just stating that I had been diagnosed by him.

Thank you for sharing with us about your assessment.
Being officially diagnosed with ADHD typically involves a comprehensive evaluation, which includes clinical interviews, self-reporting, and often input from other sources such as teachers or parents. The lack of forms given to your teachers might be a part of the overall assessment process to gather additional information about your behavior in different environments.
While the signed letter from the psychiatrist confirms the diagnosis, having a detailed report from the psychologist can provide more comprehensive insights. The report may include a summary of the assessment process, the specific criteria met for the diagnosis, and any recommendations for treatment or accommodations.
If you have concerns or questions about your diagnosis, it’s completely okay to discuss them with your psychiatrist. You can ask about the possibility of obtaining a more detailed report or clarification on the assessment process. From there, you can get a confirmation from him as well if it is the final part of the assessment or if it’s official for your case.

I’m 30M and currently going through a rather interesting phase in life. I left my full time sales job of 5 years in 2021 as I felt it no longer aligns with what I want to achieve for myself and also the relationship between my peers wasnt as healthy due to it being a competitive role. After leaving, I tried earning money online, it was okay but not sustainable in the long run as I was mostly doing it on my own. during this period I gradually became a shut in and I wasnt very comfortable with meeting people even if they were close to me. From what I’ve read is probably because I was afraid of people asking me “what are you doing now?” as I would not be confident to share with my situation at that point of time. after that I went to work 2 retail jobs. First one I left as it was mostly a 1 man show and Im doing 8-5. followed by 930-1030 for closing. For the second one i put in a more conscious effort to socialise and was given more roles in a short period of time. The system was unique as it wasnt a standard pos system and most things need to be manually adjusted to cater to situations (changing of payment method halfway, looking for an item that wasnt updated in inventory system, refunds) so I ended up asking questions often to clairfy as I wouldnt want to mess it up. due to that eventually I was asked to leave. Which was an interesting experience since i was in the management role in my full time job.
After that I started to have insomnia, slept around 8 in the morning daily for a few weeks. Met friends who was willing to help me out and now Im on a project based role to help out their business and the income is decent. We met a few times to work on the project and so far its been better. But the nature of the role takes a few months. So sometimes its idle. during this period I get alittle ‘worried’ that Im not doing anything and may reflect how much Im willing to do to make this work. but at the same time I dont want to be constantly asking questions since that didnt turn out too well the last time haha. Usually i’ll meet them during weekends. So during weekdays I cant relax, I feel that if I take it as this is going to work out I’ll be getting myself too comfortable too soon. I cant sleep till 5am and now im waking up at 1pm. which isnt really the best feeling. I’m not sure if its because things are not moving fast enough or I am just thinking too much.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles, it sounds like you’ve been through quite a journey lately, working through changes in your career and trying to find a path that aligns with your goals and values. Sometimes, transition periods can be both exciting and challenging, bringing about various emotions and uncertainties.
It’s completely normal to feel a bit uncertain during times of change, and it’s clear that you’re putting effort into finding a balance that suits you. Here are a few suggestions that might help you manage the current phase:
2. Establish a Routine: Setting a daily routine can help regulate your sleep patterns and provide a sense of structure. Try to wake up and go to bed at consistent times, even on weekends.
3. Set Realistic Goals: Break down your project-based work into smaller, manageable goals. This can help you focus on short-term achievements and reduce the feeling of stagnation during idle periods.
4. Stay Connected: Maintaining social connections is really important, especially during transitional phases. Keep in touch with friends, family, or even former colleagues for support and a sense of community.
5. Explore Hobbies and Interests: Use this time to engage in activities you enjoy or explore new hobbies. It can be a great way to not only pass the time but also to discover new aspects of yourself and potentially find inspiration for your career path.
Remember, it’s okay to take some time to adjust and figure things out. Be patient with yourself and focus on your own unique journey.

I realised that i tend to not be as interested in the lives of those around me as i grow older (im nearing mid 20s),including my friends and family as much as i used to in secondary school. I also feel that i dont feel as much, like empathise with them when i listen to them sharing their problems which i feel quite bad about it as i feel that i am pretending to be interested in and emphathise with what they are saying when in actual fact i am not.
As a result,i am getting increasingly more comfortable with spending time alone rather than spending time with my friends as i feel disgusted by myself at having to pretend that i am interested when im not (which i feel it’s not respectful to the one talking/sharing so i would rather spend time alone.)
I also realised that because of this, i tend to avoid socialising with others on more personal topics except when required (i.e. group projects/work) and i feel that this is making it hard for me to form deeper connections or to even make new friends.
Sometimes,i feel really bad for friends who are so friendly and welcoming to me, who are willing to engage in conversations with me but yet i cannot show much interest and reactions to what they are saying. (Which i felt dampened their excitement at what they wanted to share).
I personally feel that i am quite sensitive and am someone who gets easily hurt but dont show it so this situation helps me feel less (which is less emotionally draining). However, i would like to better connect with my emotions and be more interested in whatever happening around me or at least be more emotionally available for people around.

Happy New Year to you, and thank you for sharing with us your struggles on this platform. I appreciate you opening up about your feelings and experiences, as it takes courage to reflect on ourselves and seek understanding. I can see that you’ve noticed a shift in your level of interest and empathy towards others as you’ve grown older, and that this change is affecting your social interactions and connections. I acknowledge these feelings of confusion and curiosity, and I’m here to support you in exploring this further.
Firstly, let’s reflect on this change. What do you think might have contributed to this shift in your ability to connect emotionally with others? Are there specific experiences or changes in your life that stand out to you? Or did anything happen that you can think of, that might have caused this shift?
Secondly, you mentioned feeling uncomfortable with the idea of pretending to be interested in others’ lives. Can you explore what might be behind this discomfort? Is there a fear or concern that arises when you contemplate being more emotionally engaged in conversations?
I want to encourage you that when it comes to understanding these feelings, it is a journey, and it’s okay to take your time with it. As always, if you feel that you need more guidance in processing these feelings, please do reach out to a mental health professional who may be able to dig deeper with you and help you understand these feelings better.

To answer your questions,
Firstly, i think what might have contributed to this shift in my ability to connect with others emotionally could be the following:
2. I often feel drained in school and i dont feel like listening to issues which are often negative as they will make me feel more drained.
3. When someone shares about his or her worries, i would feel emotionally burdened as i often dont know how i should react /give appropriate advice (due to the worries or issues being something that i have not experienced before) to make that individual feel better (as i feel that the reason why someone shares an issue with you is often to seek for help/advice).
4. Sometimes, it’s clearly someone’s fault that something is not right but then i am not someone who is comfortable with being direct, so i often would choose to keep quiet instead of being direct with that someone about the cause of the issue (in case someone is easily offended/will feel upset with me being too direct out of goodwill). And this causes me to feel stress as i would feel like im actually cheating people and myself when i clearly know what is causing the issue. (i think this is also an issue with me trying to battle my own morality.)
The third point has been more pertinent recently (since maybe end of year 2022) as i had an incident with a friend of mine (let’s call that friend A). So A and i went on a trip after exams, everything was fine and enjoyable for the first 2 days (it was a 1 week trip), then A’s father came and drove us around for the rest of the trip. From what i understood from A, A’s parents divorced when she was quite young (around 5-6 years old if i remembered correctly) and A’s mum did not divorce on good terms. But A’s father still supported A financially for school and for staying in the hostel (including meal plans and overseas exchange trip) and from what i observed during the trip, he seems to treat A quite well. But A has always expressed her anger towards A’s dad and how A always dont like seeing him when dads not around while on some occasions, saying how A personally pitied for dad when he has to support A while also supporting his own family after remarrying. So i listened and try to understand A’s family background.
During the trip, as i was driven around by A’s dad, i felt really bad as he was treating me meals and even paid for a hotel stay for me and A. I wanted to pay him back for the meals and whatnot but was rejected when i tried to do so. A upon seeing that i tried to pay A’s dad back, commented very grudgingly that A would choose to spend his money rather than pay him back ( I’m not sure if A was angry with what i did during that time which led to the incident later on). Also, during the trip, A is a big spender and someone who i would say ‘spends on things that are expensive and considered a luxury(e.g branded shoes, lots of dessert (as A has a sweet tooth and can eat desserts as meals) given A’s financial situation’ (A comes from a low-income family). So i was trying to tell A not to spend too much and think about whether A needs the things or not. Also, was telling A that the luggages may be too heavy to carry (A was already struggling with carrying when we go on the trip) when making our way home and i cannot help her carry as i have mine to carry. Furthermore, i realised that A has a habit of squeezing and putting food (e.g. bread with cream filling) back on the shelves roughly when A was done viewing them or as A said ’ for the fun of it’. So i was also telling A to not do that as the products are for sale and others are eating them. I think i did these actions(i.e asking A to not throw food and avoid buying unnecessary stuff) throughout the trip and as we came to the end of the trip, i realised that A started not talking to me and was ignoring me. When i asked A if i did something to offensive, A started venting angrily about how i was imposing my values on A and how i should reevaluate my morals. I was honestly very shocked and upset that A didnt tell me about all these during the trip when i thought A would (as A always said that A will be honest with me if A feels uncomfortable and whatnot) and angry as well as i felt attacked by A’s words and how i could not have the right to communicate my thoughts and feelings to A (as A was just really picking on whatever i said and i thus decided to stay silent.) I do admit that i might have not have been very nice with my tone when i talked to A but i have apologised to A about it and i hoped that A has accepted it. But to be honest, till this day, i am still not sure why was A angry for exactly but i found no value to pursue this matter as i am afraid of offending A in any way anymore and i could not stand A’s unreasonable responses in anger again. I realised that i was quite traumatised by this incident(i was shaking uncontrollably) when i recounted again and shared with others and i took quite some time to be able to be calm when i rethink about this issue. Ever since then, i starting to think that i was being too meddlesome with what others do and tried to keep my thoughts and reactions to myself when interacting with others.
(So sorry for the long story, just wanted to write out what made me feel this and allow you to better understand my situation but i think the above contributed to the change in my ability to connect emotionally with others.
As to what might contribute to my discomfort in pretending to be interested in others’ lives, i think it’s more of me feeling that i am not true to myself and i dont feel like i am myself (i feel like im very fake in my reactions when i am not interested but still have to pretend in being so). Also, I fear that i might come across as being insincere when i dont give any reactions or show interest in others when they are sharing their thoughts or lives with much emotions so i tend to pretend to be interested. I think my concern with being more emotionaly engaged in conversations is the possibility of me being too into the situation and saying things that are not emotionally in sync/deemed right emotionally with the situation as the others (as they might say the right thing might be to do some other things instead of the advice that i suggested? I feel kind of defeated when this happens as i feel that my advice is of no help and so this might make me want to want to close up and not be as emotionally engaged so i think that’s how i resorted to pretending to be interested and not care so much about the issue.)
I thin the above are my concerns and reasons behind why i am doing what i did so far during interactions. Thank you so much for your help and time, really do appreciate your efforts in trying to understand my emotions.",,2,,,,,

I want to thank you for sharing your feelings and experiences with such openness. I can see that the incident during the trip with your friend A had a deep impact on you, and I can imagine it must have been quite distressing. I think it is fairly common for conflicts to arise in friendships, especially when there are differing values or communication styles.
It sounds like you made genuine efforts to be considerate during the trip, expressing concern about expenses and offering to contribute, as well as advising A about certain behaviors. It can be difficult when our attempts to help are met with anger or misunderstanding, and I understand that it left you feeling shaken and hesitant to express yourself in the future.
I want to acknowledge the emotions you experienced during and after the incident, such as shock, upset, and fear of offending A. Your concerns about being perceived as meddlesome or insincere in your interactions with others are valid, and it seems like this has led you to adopt a more reserved approach to avoid potential conflict.
It’s okay to feel the way you do, and it’s understandable that such an incident might influence your ability to connect emotionally with others. It seems like you’ve been reflecting on your communication style and trying to understand the reasons behind your discomfort in pretending to be interested in others’ lives.
I think you might want to try 2 things:
2. Consider having an open and honest conversation with your friend A about the incident during the trip. You can share your perspective, expressing your intention to be helpful and your confusion about the sudden change in A’s behavior. Use “I” statements to avoid sounding accusatory and focus on your feelings rather than placing blame. For example, you might say, “I felt surprised and hurt when our dynamic changed during the trip, and I’ve been trying to understand what happened. Can we talk about it so we can both gain clarity and move forward?”
3. Given the impact of the incident and your concerns about your communication style, seeking support from a therapist could be helpful for you. A therapist can provide a safe space for you to explore your emotions, identify patterns in your interactions, and work on strategies to communicate effectively. Therapy can also help you build self-confidence, navigate social situations, and find a balance between being true to yourself and respecting others’ perspectives.
I appreciate your honesty and self-reflection, and I’m here to support you as you continue to explore and work through these emotions. Please let us know your thoughts further and how you’ve been coping so far. Hear from you soon.",,0,,10264,,10264.0,

Thank you for taking the time to share with us your struggles, I acknowledge your frustrations and worries. I’m sorry to hear that you’re going through such a challenging time in your relationship. It’s commendable that you recognize the need for change and are willing to take responsibility for your actions.
Here are some steps you might consider to help resolve the conflict and work towards building a healthier relationship:
- Open Communication: Perhaps you could reach out to your partner with an open and sincere conversation and express your realization of the mistakes you’ve made and genuinely apologize for any hurt you may have caused. Let her know that you’re committed to making positive changes and that you value her feelings and needs
- Listen Actively: During your conversation, make an effort to actively listen to her perspective and allow her the space to express her feelings and concerns without interruption. This can help build a sense of understanding and help rebuild trust.
- Ask for Feedback: Seek her input on how you can improve and be more attentive in the future. Ask about her needs, expectations, and how you can better support her emotionally. This shows that you’re committed to making genuine changes.
- Seek Couples Counseling: If the situation warrants it, you could consider seeking the help of a professional couples counselor. A neutral third party can provide guidance and facilitate productive communication, and help both of you to strengthen the relationship.
Last but not least, remember, change takes time, and it’s important to be patient and understanding as both of you work through this process. If you’re both willing to put in the effort, there’s hope for positive growth and improvement in your relationship

The pressure of upcoming results and the fear of your family’s reaction can be overwhelming indeed. I want you to know that we recognize your efforts and acknowledge that you’ve done your best given the circumstances.
It might be helpful to explore ways to cope with stress and anxiety, perhaps finding new activities or outlets that bring you comfort. Additionally, if you ever feel comfortable, consider talking to a counselor or therapist who can provide professional guidance and support. You could talk to a school counsellor, or even an external one that’s nearest to your home (Family Service Centre )

Firstly, thank you for sharing with us your struggles on this platform. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way, and I want to commend you for reaching out. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it takes courage to seek support. I can tell that you’re facing a lot of pressure and challenges in different aspects of your life.
I want to encourage you, that anxiety and social struggles are very, very common, especially during adolescence stage. You’re still discovering who you are and how you fit into the world All of us have been through this stage too. Your desire to improve and be accepted is completely understandable
Here are a few suggestions that might help:
2. Seek Professional Support: Consider talking to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or school counselor as they can provide a safe space for you to explore your thoughts and feelings and offer guidance on managing anxiety.
3. Communication Skills: Since you mentioned struggling with social skills, you might benefit from working on communication skills - this could involve actively listening, observing social cues, and practicing empathy. A therapist can also assist you with these skills
4. Self-Compassion: Remember that everyone makes mistakes and goes through challenges. Be kind to yourself and recognize that personal growth takes time. Don’t be too hard on yourself!
5. Talk to Someone: Share your feelings with someone you trust, whether it’s a friend, teacher, or family member. Opening up about your struggles can be a great step toward receiving understanding and support. You can also brainstorm some ideas together about how to manage your feelings too.
6. Healthy Lifestyle: Ensure you’re taking care of your physical health. You could try regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep which can all contribute to better mental well-being.
I also feel it’s important to involve your parents in this process, so they can better understand your difficulties and provide extra support. If they are unaware of your struggles, do consider having an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings and your desire to work on improving yourself.
Remember, it’s okay to seek help, and you don’t have to work through these challenges alone. Do let us know how you’re doing and keep us updated, I’ll hear from you soon.",Be kind to yourself 2 https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=be_kind,0,,10231,,10231.0,

Firstly, thank you for sharing with us your struggles on this platform. I hear how challenging and overwhelming this situation is for you, and I commend you for sharing. It takes a lot of strength to open up about your struggles, and I want to acknowledge your courage in seeking help and pursuing the ADHD test despite the obstacles you’re facing.
I can imagine how concerning it feels when your worries about mental health are not being fully understood or supported by your parents. I just want to encourage you that seeking help and getting a diagnosis is a great step toward understanding yourself better and finding the right support. It’s not a reflection of weakness but a proactive approach to improving your well-being.
Your feelings of guilt and worry about how your parents might perceive you after a potential diagnosis are valid, and it’s actually pretty common for individuals to experience such worries. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings and concerns, emphasizing the importance of their support during this process. If you find it difficult to start the conversation, you can try out this tool which can help you prepare for the conversation.
As for the anxiety and feelings of losing grip on reality, I hear you and I feel that it’s important that you consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support. They can help you explore your feelings, develop coping strategies, and process through these challenging times. It will be helpful if you can reach out to any of the professionals from a nearby Family Service Centre, or any school counsellor who may be accessible for you.

Thank you for sharing your struggles, I hear you and your feelings are valid.
Based on the information you provided, some of the experiences you describe could be associated with conditions such as sensory processing sensitivity or difficulties with executive functions. However, it’s important to note that a proper diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional after a thorough assessment - such as a psychologist or a specialist.
If you’re experiencing challenges in social interactions, difficulties with sensory sensitivity, and issues with completing everyday tasks, it might be helpful to consult with a healthcare professional or a specialist who can conduct a comprehensive evaluation to better understand your situation and provide appropriate guidance.
Also, perhaps open communication with your parents or those close to you about your experiences and seeking professional help could be helpful steps in understanding and managing the challenges you’re currently facing.

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us here, and I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult situation at work. It sounds incredibly tough to manage for now, and your feelings of frustration and exhaustion are completely valid. I can imagine it must be emotionally draining to experience prolonged meetings with your boss and to feel criticized and corrected consistently.
Feeling trapped in a toxic work environment can be overwhelming, and it’s understandable that you’re concerned about the impact on your well-being. The lack of communication from management and the added pressure of figuring things out on your own only intensify the challenges you’re facing.
I would like to encourage you to prioritize your mental health, and if you’re comfortable, considering a conversation with your boss about how her communication style is affecting you might be a step forward. Additionally, reaching out to HR or a supervisor for support could provide assistance in addressing these workplace dynamics.
At the end of the day, it is truly your decision on whether or not to leave - but do put your mental health on top of the list and take care of your emotional state.
Remember that your well-being is truly important, and exploring potential options for a healthier work environment is also a valid consideration. If you’d like to discuss this further or explore coping strategies, I’m here to offer support.

First of all, thank you for sharing your struggles with us on this platform, it takes so much courage to be authentic about feeling at a loss, and I commend you for that.
I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way, and it sounds like you’re going through a very difficult time. I want to assure you that what you’re experiencing is valid, and you’re not alone in feeling overwhelmed. Again, it takes a lot of strength to reach out for support, and I’m here to help you explore these feelings.
Firstly, I want to acknowledge that the difficulties you’re facing are real and completely deserve attention. It’s actually very common for people to feel paralyzed by stress and anxiety, making it difficult to focus on tasks. I’m glad that you’ve sought support from school counselors, a doctor, and a psychiatrist, but I can imagine that it’s disheartening when their responses haven’t fully addressed your struggles.
I’d like to suggest considering a few strategies to cope with the overwhelming feelings you’re experiencing:
1) Break tasks into smaller steps: When you’re facing a large workload, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks can make it less intimidating. Focus on completing one small step at a time, and hopefully this will help you to complete the tasks in a manageable way.
2) Self-compassion: Be kind to yourself. Understanding that your struggles don’t make you useless or a burden. I affirm to you that all of us do face challenges, and it’s totally okay to seek help and take things one step at a time. Remember to have compassion on yourself
3) Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Practice techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to help calm your racing thoughts and reduce the physical symptoms of stress.
4) Consider seeking additional professional help: If the support you’ve received so far hasn’t been sufficient, it might be worthwhile to explore other therapy options. A licensed therapist or counselor could provide more specialized support tailored to your unique situation. For starters, you can try these online options or go to a nearest Family Service Centre to seek support.

I would put myself in your shoes because I have the same thoughts with you. It is a struggle to want to get things done but feel so overwhelmed and tired that you become dreaded to start the ball rolling.
How i can validate your feelings is that remember, change takes time and effort. Start with small, manageable steps, and gradually incorporate these strategies into your daily routine.
You might want to start by developing a realistic schedule or to-do list. Allocate specific time slots for tasks, and stick to your schedule as closely as possible. This helps create structure and accountability.
Identify high-priority tasks and tackle them first. This builds momentum and a sense of accomplishment, making it easier to approach other tasks.
Break your work into intervals, typically 25 minutes of focused work followed by a short break. This can enhance productivity and reduce the tendency to procrastinate.
It is important to create a conducive work environment. A clean, organized space can positively impact your mindset and reduce distractions.
Replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations. Focus on your strengths and past successes, reminding yourself that you are capable.
When negative thoughts arise, question their validity. Are they based on facts, or are they assumptions? Challenge negative self-talk to reframe your perspective. I encourage you to acknowledge and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. This reinforces a positive mindset and motivates you to continue making progress. Engage with positive influences, whether it’s supportive friends, motivational content, or inspiring stories. Surrounding yourself with positivity can uplift your mood. I was unmotivated and actually watched a movie called Sing 2 (it is available on netflix) and it helped me become inspired and believe my own potentials.
I hope you are able to become the best version of yourself, all the best to you!",,1,,9228,,9228.0,

You should take a few days break and take your mind of of things. Perhaps not to focus about the amount of work you have instead maybe do something you enjoy. One thing that worked for me was to write down all my stresses in a book or talk to them to a friend it really helps! Remember, do not force yourself to do something you do not want to do. It is not the best for yourself and would add more pressure. Indeed putting your heart into things help but you should take a short break before anything else. I hope this will help!",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us here, and I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. I can see that you’re going through a diffiuclt time, and it takes a lot of courage to reach out.
May I ask some questions for you to share more:
2. What specific aspects of your current situation in the army are contributing most to your emotional and mental struggles?
3. In envisioning an ideal scenario where you could address your mental health needs, what steps or changes would you ideally like to see happen in your professional and personal life?
Considering your situation, it might be helpful to take the following steps:
2. Speak to a Mental Health Professional: It’s important to talk to someone who can provide support and guidance. Please know that there are mental health professionals or counselors available. If you’re uncomfortable speaking with someone in your unit, you may also consider seeking external support, such as a private therapist or counselor.
3. Communicate with Your Chain of Command: If you’re comfortable, consider discussing your mental health concerns with someone in your chain of command. They may be able to provide assistance or direct you to appropriate resources. It’s essential to communicate openly about your struggles, as they may impact your ability to fulfill your duties effectively.
4. Explore Available Support Services: Perhaps you could explore the mental health services and resources provided by the army unit? There might be programs or assistance available that you’re not aware of, and these services are designed to support individuals facing the unique challenges of military life.
5. Consider Seeking a Medical Evaluation: If your mental health concerns are deeply impacting your ability to perform your duties, it might be appropriate to seek a medical evaluation. This can help determine the best course of action for your well-being.
Last but not least, I understand that it might feel overwhelming sometimes, so please do keep these numbers and contact them in case of emergency or in case you find yourself in crisis:

Thank you for taking the time to share with us your struggles, and for being so authentic here.
I appreciate you sharing your concerns, and I can see that you’re facing challenges in your intimate relationship with your partner. I acknowledge the impact that the addiction and subsequent anxiety have had on your marriage, and I’m sorry to hear how difficult it is for you both now.
I would like to ask a couple of questions to help you reflect on the situation:
2. Can you identify specific triggers or thoughts that contribute to your anxiety about sex, and are there patterns in your communication with your spouse that exacerbate these concerns? For example, is it because you fear ‘failing’ her expectations in the process or etc…?
3. Have you considered seeking professional help, such as a therapist or counselor, to explore the root causes of your anxiety, improve communication with your spouse, and work on strategies to enhance intimacy in your relationship? There are relationship therapists who help specifically with these issues that you’re struggling with.
Addressing these issues with a mental health professional can provide you with valuable insights and support. They can help you manage the emotional aspects of your struggles and work towards building a healthier and more satisfying connection with your spouse.
Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, and it’s never too late to work on improving your relationship. If you have any additional concerns or if there’s anything else you’d like to discuss, please feel free to share. Let us know how you’re coping and what you’ve decided to do, we’ll be here for you.

7137,How does one know they are ready for a Committed Relationship?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/how-does-one-know-they-are-ready-for-a-committed-relationship/7137,Seeking Help,needadvice,5752,moment369,User,,10102,1,"Hi there,
I’ve been romantically connecting with someone for the past 5 years, and we did communicate that we are not mutually exclusive, yet somehow we were mutually exclusive, and I found myself in a situationship since. To add on, we are not based in the same country, therefore not having much opportunity to have in-person time.
Throughout the years, at different points in these 5 years, I did bring up the topic of pursuing a committed relationship, and it somehow added stress and tension for both of us. One reason being we take committed relationship seriously and therefore would consider a lot before making a decision, and the second being he finds that we are not equal in this relationship (where he feels he’s more of the adult one compared to me, more of the child-like) hence couldn’t decide to commit.
It then also made me reflect, and also question if I myself am ready for a relationship. I always had the idea of being closely intimate and connected with someone and being in this partnership with them to journey through our lives together. But I also wonder if I truly know or understand what being in a romantic relationship means and if there’s any childhood trauma or baggage that I have to work on myself to truly love myself first as the basis for any relationship.
It will be nice to hear some thoughts on this and receive an outside perspective on this situation. Apologies for the messy writing, I do hope I explained this situation as clearly as possible. Thank you for reading, I appreciate it!",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. It sounds like you’ve been managing a complex and emotionally charged situation over the past five years, and I appreciate your courage in opening up about it with us here.
Firstly, I want to acknowledge the depth of your reflections on the dynamics of your relationship and the challenges you’ve faced. I can see that the issue of commitment has been a source of stress and tension for both of you, and it’s commendable that you’ve been open in discussing your feelings and desires.
The fact that your partner perceives an imbalance in the relationship, with him feeling more like the “adult” and you the “child-like,” adds another layer of complexity indeed. Your view about your readiness for a relationship and the potential impact of childhood experiences on your perceptions is a thoughtful and important aspect to explore. Understanding oneself is an important foundation for any relationship, and I commend your willingness to look into these questions.
I can also see that your desire for a committed relationship is rooted in a deep longing for intimacy and connection. It may be helpful to continue these reflections and perhaps explore them further with a therapist or counselor who can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for self-discovery. Perhaps for a start, you could reflect on these questions:
2. What specific aspects of a committed relationship are most important to you, and how do those align with your partner’s values and expectations?
3. When thinking about the “imbalance” in your relationship dynamics, what specific behaviors or actions contribute to these roles (i.e. adult and child)?
4. Do you think you might have a open communication and understanding help address or reshape these dynamics?
Remember, these matters are complex, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Taking the time to understand yourself, your needs, and your boundaries is a valuable investment in your well-being. If you have any specific questions or if there’s a particular aspect you’d like to discuss further, please feel free to share. I’m here to support you on your journey",,2,,10102,,10102.0,

I just graduated and am in my first job (6 months in). Ever since secondary school, most of my time has been spent studying.
Now that I’m at work, I want to have a good work life balance. To me, that means working 8.30-6, only. However, I find myself worried and thinking about work on weekends, and after work. Most days now, I sleep at 9.30/10 so that I can wake up at 6.30am to leave for work.
Work is quite hectic, and I guess it’s also my negative thoughts that makes work harder than it should be. I have supportive work colleagues, and I have made my feelings known before. I went for counselling because the work load was too much for me at one point, and I got anxious. End November to December is better because the work load is lesser as most people go on holidays.

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us, I appreciate your vulnerability. I can see that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is important to you, and it’s commendable that you’ve taken steps to work on your anxiety, including seeking counseling and communicating with your colleagues. Let’s explore a couple of strategies to help you manage anxiety at work:
2. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Incorporating mindfulness or relaxation exercises into your routine can be helpful This could include deep breathing exercises , short meditation sessions, or even a brief walk during breaks. These practices can help you stay present and manage stress.
3. Setting Boundaries: It might be good to establish clear boundaries between work and personal time. When you leave the office or log off from work, make a conscious effort to shift your focus to personal activities, by creating a clear separation between work and leisure which can help reduce anxiety during your non-working hours. For example, not responding to your work emails or work calls can be helpful to set boundaries.
I’m also curious to know, have you explored any specific mindfulness or relaxation techniques before, and if so, how did they work for you? Additionally, what steps have you taken to communicate your boundaries effectively to your colleagues and ensure they are respected?
I am also thinking it might be a good idea to continue your counselling sessions to help you cope better with the situation, and find new strategies to help you manage the negative thoughts as well.

I understand that you feel overwhelmed with the change of phase in life trying to integrate into the workforce.
Actually, you might want to consider practicing mindfulness, self-care. These can help you reduce anxiety at work. Break your tasks into smaller, more manageable parts, it helps to feel that the workload is less overwhelming, you may also prioritize tasks and tackle them one at a time.
Taking short breaks throughout the day can also help reset your mind and reduce stress. Ensure you have a comfortable and organized workspace to minimize external stressors.
Communication is key- don’t be afraid to discuss your concerns with colleagues or supervisors. They might offer support or help you find solutions. Set realistic expectations for yourself and recognize that it’s okay not to be perfect.
If you are feeling tense, you can practice deep breathing exercise while listening to one favourite song of yours. Just take a few minutes to focus on your breath, inhaling deeply for a count of four, holding for four, and exhaling for four and you will find yourself given a break to sustain throughout the day.
If you are tense because of work, communicate with colleagues or your supervisor. For instance, if you’re unsure about a project’s requirements, seek clarification. Effective communication can prevent unnecessary stress. You can also set achievable goals daily. Instead of aiming to complete an entire project in one day, set a goal to finish a specific part or make significant progress.
In order to achieve work-life balance, you must set boundaries, prioritize tasks, learn how to say no, schedule personal time, delegate responsibilities, unplug from work, focus on quality over quantity, and take regular breaks. This will allow you to fulfill both work and personal commitments while prioritizing your own well-being.",,1,,10072,,10072.0,

Im in my mid 20s and I have realised quite a few years back that I cant really seem to remember things that I do. You can say my memory space is probably a week old and I cant seem to remember details/any memory that I’ve made. Its either pretty vague or in bits & pieces.
If someone ever ask me how am I like when I was young, I cant remember anything. I just find myself speechless and I cant seem to produce an answer. What about Primary School? Honestly only just 1/2 incidents that was pretty impactful in a negative way. I had school trips, but I remembered nothing.
What about Secondary School? Honestly not much and I had a date back then. I find myself not remembering much about us anymore because we barely did anything new together. I find myself losing memory as days goes by.
Poly? Honestly not much either. Just bits and pieces and some impactful things that was negative as well. Most of my memories that I remembered are those that hurt me in a way or another.
Even those I finished Uni for about 2 years now, I cant remember much and really it is what it is. It felt like I didnt live for this long and life just past by and I only remember things that impact me in a bad way.
I tend to take a lot of photos and videos because that is how i try to remember things or at least refresh what I have done.
Is this normal? I just hate it when someone asked me if I remember this or that, there is nothing that came up to my head like I wasnt there at all. Sometimes I still have to act like I remember, which I dont at all.

First of all, thank you for sharing your thoughts and struggles here on this platform. I want to acknowledge and commend you for reaching out and sharing your feelings and experiences so authentically. It takes courage to express what you’re going through and I hear that you’ve been grappling with concerns about your memory, and it’s understandably causing you distress.
It’s important to recognize that your feelings are valid, and you’re not alone in seeking answers. Memory concerns can be complex, and there could be various factors at play. It’s brave of you to reflect on your experiences and try to understand them better. It is also actually a pretty common experience for most people (even myself!) to forget a lot of things from our past.
Some people may seem to remember or have clearer memories of their past, but there are many who cannot remember specific details or happy memories too. My sense is that it’s likely because there’s nothing too big or impactful that happened in the past to remember it clearly. Personally, even when I see photos of my childhood (both happy and bad memories) I still cannot recall those experiences + feelings, but it doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong It’s common!
But yes, while I’m not a substitute for professional evaluation, I encourage you to consider speaking with a healthcare professional or a mental health professional who can provide personalized support and guidance about this memory issue. They can help explore the factors contributing to your memory experiences and work with you to develop coping strategies or interventions.
I just want to let you know that it’s okay to seek help, and there are professionals trained to help you on this journey. Please take care, and feel free to share more if you find it helpful. We’ll hear from you soon!",,2,,9985,,9985.0,

Something had happened at his previous place of employment between him and a boss. He refuses to go into detail and the examples given seems like it was not big enough to have such vendetta. He has since been unemployed for more than 1.5 years and not able to get on with life. While unemployed, he still constantly talks about his devices and wifi are not safe as they are getting hacked.
He seems to understand he is going through depression which I believe he is as well but not sure to what degree but I think it is probably a contributing factor to why he is unmotivated to find new work.
But depression alone does not seem to explain the paranoia of getting targeted by someone. He says that he needs to find out who is hacking him or things like he needs to move somewhere else, out of the country. At the start the paranoia was so bad that he would suspect family members of conspiring against him. He wouldn’t use his computer, and turn off the wifi as well. This behaviour was never prevalent in the past. and I am 99% sure it isn’t at a normal degree of worrying about being a target of hacking by an ex employer who you had a disagreement with.
Someone once tried to talk to him and mentions about the possibility of him having an induced psychosis but he doesn’t believe it and doesn’t think that these types of things would happen to him. He has tried taking medication for depression but he doesn’t believe in therapy and probably have not been fully honest with the therapist or psychologist.
I want to help him get better but I don’t know how to approach the situation and it feels like telling him that I think he might have some mental issues would just make him angrier. And also the fact he doesn’t believe in therapy is not helping.",,3,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us the struggle that you’re experiencing, I can hear that you’re deeply concerned about your older sibling, and it’s clear that you care a great deal about their well-being. It must be challenging to witness the changes in his behavior and the impact it’s having on his life. It sounds like there are multiple layers to what he is experiencing, and it’s commendable that you want to support him.
It’s understandable that approaching this situation feels delicate, especially when your sibling is resistant to the idea of therapy. It might be helpful to express your concern from a place of care rather than framing it as a mental health issue.
You could say something like, “I’ve noticed that you’ve been going through a tough time lately, and I really care about you. I’ve observed changes in your behavior, and it seems like you’re dealing with a lot. Have you thought about talking to someone, maybe a friend or a professional, just to share what’s on your mind? It might help to have some support.”
We have a conversation tool that might also help you to prepare for this conversation - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Also, do avoid direct accusations or labels as it may make it more likely for your sibling to open up. You can emphasize that seeking support is a normal and healthy way to manage his challenges, and that many people actually find it beneficial.

Me and my SO are 29,28 years old respectively. We have been together for 11 years, however, what’s bothering us(mostly me) is her low libido and it’s on the decline.
Nowadays after getting married, we only engages in sexual ■■■■■■■■■■■ for a maximum of 1 or 2 times a month and it’s already a push for her. I dont like the ideal of imposing this routine that she’s not comfortable with.
She can go a full year without engaging in sexual activities but I’ll be sexually frustrated as I have libido on the higher side.
What are the solutions that we can explore to address this issue?

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles, I hear you, and it’s understandable that differences in libido can be a source of concern and frustration in a long-term relationship. I commend you for the effort for seeking solutions rather than ignoring the issue.
Here are some suggestions you can consider:
2. Open Communication: This is the foundation of addressing any issue in a relationship. Approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Express your feelings and concerns, and encourage your partner to share her perspective as well. Avoid blaming language and instead focus on finding solutions together. You can also try this tool on having difficult conversations: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Seek Professional Guidance: Consider consulting a sex therapist or a couples’ counselor. A trained professional can help facilitate discussions, provide insights, and offer strategies to improve intimacy. They can also help both of you explore the root causes of the discrepancy in libido. You can consider reaching out to Dr Martha Tara Lee who is one of the few certified Relationship Counselor & Clinical Sexologist in Singapore.
4. Health Check: Sometimes, changes in libido can be linked to physical health issues or hormonal imbalances. Encourage your partner to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any potential medical reasons for the decline in libido.
5. Explore Intimacy Beyond Sex: Intimacy is not solely about sexual activity. Focus on building emotional and physical connection through other means, such as cuddling, spending quality time together, and engaging in activities that bring you closer. This can create a foundation for a more fulfilling sexual relationship.
6. Evaluate Stress and Lifestyle Factors: High levels of stress, exhaustion, or changes in lifestyle can contribute to a decline in libido. Assess whether external factors are affecting your partner’s desire for intimacy and work together to find ways to alleviate stress or make positive lifestyle changes.
7. Set Realistic Expectations: It’s essential to find a balance that works for both partners. While compromise is crucial, it’s also important to set realistic expectations. Both partners need to feel comfortable and respected in the relationship.
Remember that each relationship is unique, and the solutions may vary. The key is to approach the issue collaboratively, with empathy and a shared commitment to finding a resolution that works for both of you. If needed, seeking professional guidance can provide useful insights and support for both of you.

Thank you for sharing with us how you feel, I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re experiencing such deep and persistent feelings of emptiness and loneliness, especially when surrounded by the support of your family and the things you’ve wanted. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these emotions. It sounds like this has been a difficult and painful three months for you, and the sense of losing touch with yourself can be incredibly distressing.
I want you to know that your feelings are real, and I’m here to support you as we explore and work through them together. Sometimes, understanding the root of these emotions can be complex, and it might be helpful to explore them further in a safe and supportive space.
If you could, please give us more information:
2. Could you share a bit more about when these feelings of emptiness and loneliness seem most prominent or any specific situations that trigger them?
3. Additionally, have there been any changes or events in your life around the time when these feelings started three months ago that might be contributing to your sense of fading away?
I want you to know that your experiences matter, and seeking support is a good step forward. If you feel comfortable, we can discuss these feelings in more detail and work towards finding ways to help you regain a sense of connection with yourself.

I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult time. It sounds like you’re feeling a sense of loneliness and disappointment when trying to connect with others. I want to recognize that your feelings are valid, and you’re not alone in experiencing them.
Feeling rejected or dismissed when reaching out to friends can be really tough. I am thinking that their responses may not necessarily reflect their feelings toward you, as people’s lives can get busy, and perhaps they might not fully understand the impact of their actions on your well-being.
You could consider expressing your feelings to your friends in a sincere and open way. Let them know that you’ve been struggling and that their company would mean a lot to you. Sometimes, people may not be aware of the impact their availability (or lack thereof) has on others.
If you find it challenging to talk to your friends directly or if you need additional support, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide a safe space for you to explore and work around your emotions.
It’s also important to remember that you don’t have to face these feelings alone. If you feel comfortable, consider sharing your thoughts with a trusted family member. They may offer support and understanding, and keeping them informed can help build a stronger support system around you.

Recently, I have come upon this term ‘emetophobia’. I know that I have always been fearful of vomiting in public and I constantly get anxious and worried about it (though eventually I didn’t vomit) there were many such occasions and every day I would keep thinking of it in my mind despite how hard I told myself to ignore it and tried ways to distract myself. There were several occasions that I turned down my friends’ hang out invitations because I fear I might see trigger food, feel nauseous and want to vomit. However, the problem here is that I have gone online to do test on emetophobia and I scored 16/40 on average for the tests. The part that I scored pretty high was the behavioural aspect (like the fear of eating in public and trying new food etc but I am not fearful of children around me or that people around me are sick or vomiting, I don’t really get affected by these). Not only that, when I see oily food or large scale of food, I would get anxious and start to feel a little naseous , my heart start beating fast (intend to vomit but nothing comes out) I was thinking if I really should seek therapy because it’s really affecting my emotions and relationship with food… I didn’t dare to tell my family members about this because they would simply think that it is a mindset issue.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles, I want to acknowledge and validate your feelings, as it takes a lot of courage to open up about something so personal. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a painful situation related to both your acid reflux and the fear of vomiting in public, which you’ve identified as emetophobia.
It’s completely understandable that these experiences have been affecting your emotions and your relationship with food. The anxiety and worry you describe, especially when faced with certain triggers like oily or large amounts of food, are undoubtedly distressing. I want to commend you as you’ve taken the initiative to explore the possibility of seeking therapy to address these concerns.
Your feelings are valid, and yes seeking therapy can be a helpful step in finding support and coping strategies. A therapist can provide a safe space for you to explore and understand these emotions, as well as work with you to develop effective ways to manage them.
I hear you, it’s actually very common for people to hesitate in sharing such experiences with family members, especially when there might be concerns about how they’ll be perceived. I want to encourage you that seeking help is a strength, and a therapist can offer guidance and support without judgment.
If you decide to pursue therapy, you might consider finding a mental health professional with experience in anxiety disorders and phobias. They can work with you to explore these feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and help you regain a sense of control over your emotions and relationship with food.
Take your time to make the decision that feels right for you, and know that you don’t have to face these challenges alone. Do let us know how you’re coping and what you’ve decided to do as well, we’ll be here to walk with you.

Thank you for sharing more details with us. I would think that you could try out these strategies, and I hope they work for you. But if they don’t work very well after awhile, please do consider seeking therapy as most of the time these issues are linked to deeper emotional issues that we may not be fully aware of. I would also highly encourage you to seek help from a nutritionist who may be able to guide you about your reflux.
Here are some possible strategies to try:
- Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Practice mindfulness or deep breathing exercises to help manage anxiety. You can use these tools to try:
2. Practice mindfulness - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Guided meditation - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
4. Reframe thoughts - [Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
5. Anxiety - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
6. Relaxation - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
7. Deep breaths - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Gradual Exposure: Gradually expose yourself to situations that trigger anxiety, starting with less challenging scenarios and progressively increasing difficulty. For example, if you’re meeting your friends for a meal, meet somewhere that is not filled with food items that may trigger the senses, such as meeting at a park - then ask your friends to bring out the food gradually (one by one) so that it does not overwhelm you (This is just a suggestion, you can try other ways to expose yourself gradually)
3. Nutritional Guidance: Given your acid reflux, consider consulting with a dietitian to develop a diet plan that minimizes triggers for acid reflux while still meeting your nutritional needs. This can be part of a comprehensive approach to improving your overall well-being, which will need to address the emotional or cognitive part too!
Please do consider seeking guidance from a professional therapist or nutritionist who can meet you and work on these issues specifically.

Thank you for sharing your pain with us here, I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult and painful experience. Breakups can be very painful, and it’s completely natural to feel a range of emotions, including sadness, grief, and a loss of self-esteem.
I want to acknowledge that your worth is not determined by someone else’s choices. When you compare yourself to others, especially in terms of appearance or financial status, it can be harmful to your self-esteem. It’s really important for you to focus on your own well-being and self-love during this difficult time.
I would like to encourage you to consider reaching out to supportive friends or family members who can provide emotional support. If you don’t have close connections, seeking out therapy or counseling can be a helpful resource. Talking to a mental health professional can help you process your emotions, build self-esteem, and develop coping mechanisms to work through this difficult period.

Taking care of your physical health is also very important in this season. If you’re experiencing fatigue and changes in weight, it’s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying health concerns, and to establish a routine that includes exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep that can contribute to both your physical and mental well-being.
Remember that healing is a gradual process, and it’s okay to seek help along the way. Surround yourself with supportive people and engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles here, I commend you for your authenticity and willingness and courage to share.
Experiencing mood swings and having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, even if they seem to come and go, can be concerning. Please do not dismiss these feelings or minimize their impact on your well-being. While mood swings can be a part of various mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, it’s very important to have a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional to better understand your experiences.
Suicidal thoughts are not something to be taken lightly, and they should be addressed with care and urgency. If you ever find yourself in a crisis or having immediate thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a mental health hotline or emergency services:
- SOS: 1-767
- SOS whatsapp: Share on WhatsApp
- -IMH - 63892222
It would also be good for you to seek professional help from a mental health counsellor who can guide you on managing these thoughts.

Thank you for sharing with us your thoughts, I hear you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these feelings. It sounds like you’ve been going through a frustrating and emotional time, and it’s completely okay to feel the way you do. The experience of cringing at sadness and blaming yourself for disappointments can be really tough.
I can tell that you have a genuine desire for connection with others and a longing for their presence to bring happiness into your life, and everyone deserves to have these meaningful connections, including you.
I just want to encourage you that it’s also okay to ask for support when you need it. Feeling dependent on others can be uncomfortable, but seeking connection and support is a natural part of being human - we’re all wired for connection. It might be helpful to explore these feelings further, perhaps with the support of a friend, family member, or a professional who can help you process and understand these emotions.

It’s absolutely okay to take a break from your current psychologist, and receive support via email or call (which I assume will not be in-depth like therapy sessions), while seeing another therapist in session for actual therapy
It’s only considered seeing 2 mental health professionals at a time (and discouraged to) if you meet them both for therapy sessions concurrently.
For example, a student in school can be receiving therapy sessions outside of school with a psychologist, but have the school counsellor offer adhoc support through short chats or check-ins, it’s not considered concurrent

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, and I’m sorry that you feel this way about your parents. It sounds like you’re also feeling a bit overlooked or unsupported in certain situations like the coffeeshop example, and that can be understandably frustrating. It might be helpful to communicate your feelings with your father, expressing your need for support and understanding. If your father does not know what your needs are, he would not be able to understand or meet those needs, hence it would be important for you to share with him how you feel
Here are a few suggestions on how you might approach this conversation:
2. Choose the Right Time: Find a calm and quiet moment to talk. This ensures that both of you can focus on the conversation without distractions.
3. Express Your Feelings: Share your feelings with your father without blaming or accusing. Use “I” statements to communicate how certain situations make you feel.
4. Be Specific: Provide specific examples, like the incidents you mentioned, to help your father understand the situations that have been bothering you.
5. Ask for Understanding: Let your father know that you appreciate his kindness towards others but emphasize your need for his support in various situations as well.
I can also imagine that your parents might not be very receptive to your feelings or to the conversation. You could try to help him see things from your point of view and explain that you value his guidance and assistance and that it would mean a lot to you if he could offer support when you ask for it too.
Last but not least, I think it’s also important to seek a compromise and understand that everyone has different comfort levels and expectations. You could try to find a compromise that works for both of you, ensuring that your needs are acknowledged.
Remember, open communication is key to understanding each other better. It might take some time for your father to fully grasp your perspective, so be patient and persistent in expressing your feelings. With time and understanding, change may happen so don’t give up.
Let us know if you’ve tried any of the strategies out and keep us updated?

I have been sad,guilty,insecured,unloved throughout my entire life since i can ever remember. Almost everynight I cried secretly alone. But it is not like depressed sad. I can function well in day times and feel happy when supposed to be happy. I did tried to kill myself twice at 13 and 18 years old. And i also have PMDD. Now i am 30. I have been sad all the time everyday for 8 months. I am about to burst out the tears all the time. I have 4-5 mental breakdowns a day. I only slept 3-4 hours a day. I don’t want to work at my work and i just lazy around and i missed a lot of work deadline. I used to be so good at work before. I also got trichotillomania and i pulled out all my hair in 3 months. I had very long and thick hair but now i am bald. I have suicidal thoughts too. But i am 100% sure i won’t do it. I went to consult with Psychiatrist for my trichotillomania. I told him my current situation but didn’t tell him about my childhood and suicide attempts. He prescribed me with Lexapro and Clonazepam. After taking lexapro for a week, i feel less sad and my mental breakdown decreased to 1-2 times a day. I feel like i was faking it because i felt better only one week after lexapro. Normally people say it takes 4-8 weeka for them to better. Did i do the right decision to go to Psychiatrist? And shall i tell my paychiatrist about my childhood and previous suicide attempts at my next visit? Thank you.",,2,,,,,

First of all, thank you for sharing with us your struggles. It takes a lot of courage to be so authentic with us, and I commend you for your bravery.
I’m really sorry to hear that you’re experiencing such overwhelming emotions. It’s good to hear that you sought help from a psychiatrist, and it’s important to be open and honest with them about your history, including your childhood experiences and previous suicide attempts. This information can provide very helpful insights into your current emotional state and help your psychiatrist tailor the most effective treatment plan for you.
The fact that you’ve noticed some improvement in your mood after starting Lexapro is a positive sign. It is normal for individuals to experience some changes early on in treatment, and everyone responds differently. However, I feel that it is important to communicate any concerns or doubts with your psychiatrist during your next visit, so that they can provide guidance and make adjustments to your treatment plan if needed.
In the meantime, I hope that you will continue to reach out for support, because while medication can be beneficial, combining it with therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), can provide extra comprehensive support. Therapy can help you explore and address underlying issues, develop coping strategies, and work towards long-term emotional well-being. It would be good for you to speak to your psychiatrist about receiving extra emotional support to work on those underlying issues and to help you cope better.
I want you to know that seeking help is a big step towards healing, and you deserve support and understanding. If you ever find yourself in crisis or having suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a mental health professional, a helpline, or someone you trust.

Today is my 2nd visit to my Psychiatrist and told my current conditions and history. At my first visit, i was so miserable and told him all my problems and symptons. And my husband was one of the problems. But after i took Lexapro for 10 days, my sadness is lesser and lesser and my mood became more stable although i am still sad. But not like so sad to the point of wanting to unalive myself. As my mood becomes more stable and my husband accepted that mental health problems do exit at the same time, our relationship became back to good like before. At first he didn’t understand my mental health was so back and he just thought i am spoiled or whinny or ungreatful or just being negative for nothing. But this time he said he wanted to accompany me to my visit to psychiatriat if i am comfortable. So i brought him together today as well.

I truly appreciate you sharing your journey with me, and I’m glad to hear that there have been positive shifts in your mood and relationship dynamics.

Sharing your experiences, including the positive changes and your husband’s newfound understanding, can provide valuable insights for your treatment plan.

6834,Why did it turned out this way?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/why-did-it-turned-out-this-way/6834,Seeking Help,mentalhealth,5555,nrxsbr,User,,9641,1,"Hi.
To start off, I was in a relationship for 5 years. We broke up this year september. Initially he told me that he wanted to end the relationship or in his words its “time & space” because he wanted to better himself & that we’ll get back together once we got stronger & better.
I found out that the reason he wanted to break up/ “take time & space away” was because he wanted to club & drink. I told him that at the start of the relationship that I don’t like guys who clubs & drinks… In fact our first argument was me finding out that he drank w his friends…
Initially I was so hurt by the fact that he left me so that he could party & enjoy? I’m someone who doesn’t drink or clubs but because I love him so much, I wanted to understand him better & what he enjoys so much about that night life of his, I threw away my principles, I went to a club & drank with him & a few times after. We had a talk & I told him I understand him & he wanted to get back together but I chose not to eventhough I still love him. I’m afraid that he’ll leave again like how he always do but the messed up thing is, we still talk to each other like we’re still together, we behave like we’re still in a relationship eventhough he’s talking to someone else he met at the club just to past time.
I feel disgusted with myself, I feel stupid and pathetic. I cared & loved him more than I love myself. I put him first for everything including my family. If the roles were reversed, I don’t think that he’ll do such things for me. I became unstable, I don’t remember when was the last time I was genuinely happy. The whole 5 years was toxic. We argued every day, every single fight we had, he’ll leave me/ break up with me & I’ll come begging & apologising for everything. I can admit that with him, I lost my self-love, self-respect & at this point I don’t even see my self-worth.
I finally gave up, I went to starhub to change my phone number so that no one besides my family could contact me. I had to cut ties with my bestfriend just because we share the same circle group of friends with my ex.
I just want to run away from everything, I don’t feel like myself anymore. I can’t find joy in anything I do if i’m not with him. I revolved my world around him. I can simply say that I’m obsessed with him but I’m done. It still hurts & I do breakdown randomly whenever I’m alone & sometimes, even in front of my family & I hate when that happens because I don’t want them to worry about me.",,2,,,,,

I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a painful time. It takes a lot of strength to share your feelings, and I can see that you’ve been through a lot in your relationship. I acknowledge the pain and emotions you’re experiencing, and I commend you for your courage to share with us here on this platform.
Firstly, it’s commendable that you recognized the toxicity in the relationship and took steps to distance yourself from it. Ending a long-term relationship is never easy, especially when it involves changing phone numbers and cutting ties with friends. It’s a brave decision to prioritize your well-being and take steps towards healing.
It’s understandable that you’re feeling a range of emotions, from hurt and disgust to a sense of loss and confusion. I want to gently remind you that healing from a toxic relationship is a process, and it’s okay to seek support during this time. Please be kind to yourself in this season as you continue to heal.
I think it might be helpful to consider reaching out to your friends, family, or a mental health professional who can provide guidance and a listening ear. Sometimes, talking about your feelings with someone you trust can be therapeutic and help you gain perspective on the situation. If professional help feels daunting, even opening up to a friend or family member can be a crucial first step.

I’m sorry to hear that you’re going through a difficult time. If you suspect that you may be dealing with depression and anxiety, I highly recommend that you reach out to a mental health professional for a thorough evaluation as they can provide a proper diagnosis and guide you through potential treatment options, which may include therapy/counseling, medication, or a combination of these approaches. I’m so sorry that we’re unable to assess or diagnose here on this platform, so please do seek professional advice or assessment from a mental health professional near you.
Recognizing the signs of depression and anxiety is an important step in understanding your emotions. Common signs of depression include persistent sadness, a loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide.
Likewise, anxiety often manifests as excessive worry, restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbances, and difficulty concentrating. Physical symptoms such as headaches or stomachaches may also be present.
While waiting to consult with a professional, consider implementing self-care strategies:
2. Connect with loved ones: Sharing your feelings with trusted friends or family members can provide emotional support.
3. Practice mindfulness : Engage in activities such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help manage stress.
4. Establish a routine: Creating a daily schedule can bring structure and a sense of control to your days.
5. Incorporate physical activity: Regular exercise has been linked to improved mood and mental well-being.

I have had a very toxic first relationship where it was in sum mostly fights, and I find myself (even now) to have the same fears of repeat. I get very upset when wronged or misunderstood, and the extent to which I feel upset during an argument with my partner concerns me as I don’t want to let it seem like I’m manipulating through my tears but I can’t help it, 70% of the time it gets personal to me and I start sobbing.
My boyfriend has told me I worry too much, but I feel like I don’t experience physical discomfort as seen in anxiety disorders. For context, I have a form of hair pulling disorder and this has led to a worsened self image while growing up.
Any insights on how to improve my reactions to discomfort or stress in interpersonal relationships would be great…I don’t have a close relationship with my family, but it’s not a toxic home",,2,,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to share with us your concerns, I commend you for your courage to be so open and authentic here on this platform. I also want to acknowledge the strength it takes to open up about your experiences, and I’m here to offer support and guidance as we explore ways to enhance your well-being. It sounds like you have a deep awareness of your emotions and a desire for more constructive ways to work around your situation.
It’s great that your sensitivity and ability to read between the lines are valuable qualities, and it’s understandable that they may sometimes lead to upsetting thoughts or conversations. I want to acknowledge the impact of your past toxic relationship on your current fears and reactions. Let’s work together to find strategies that can help you manage and transform these emotional responses.
Firstly, I affirm you, that your emotions are valid, and it’s okay to feel upset during disagreements - it’s completely normal and it happens to all of us too. We can explore ways to express your emotions in a manner that feels authentic to you while learning effective communication with your partner. One approach might involve developing a set of “communication tools” to use during discussions, such as taking breaks when needed, using “I” statements to express your feelings, and actively listening to your partner’s perspective. We also have a great conversation tool here that you might find helpful too.
Considering your concern about your tears being perceived as manipulation, how about you work on creating open communication with your partner? You can share with him your feelings and fears, emphasizing your commitment to healthy communication. Being transparent can help bring understanding and strengthen your connection together.
Given your history with a hair-pulling disorder and its impact on self-image, we can explore techniques to enhance self-compassion and self-esteem. Mindfulness practices, such as grounding exercises and self-affirmations, may be beneficial in promoting a more positive self-perception.
Lastly, even though you don’t experience physical discomfort characteristic of anxiety disorders, I can imagine that the emotional distress you describe is equally intense too. Seeking support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can provide you with a safe space to further explore and address these concerns. For a start, I would recommend that you seek help from a counsellor at the nearest Family Service Centre to you, or at your convenience you can talk to someone online here:

I am convinced that the world hates me. If not, then why is it that I constantly find myself in situations that leave me feeling all these horrid negative emotions? It definitely got worse in the second half (of the year). Hell, it all went downhill from May. Since then I have felt nothing but heightened anxiety and sadness. I lead every day second-guessing everything and making up the worst scenarios in my head because I don’t want to relive them again. I’ve had enough. The whole of June, I laid in bed trapped by the fear of something tragic happening in the night. All I could hear was the pounding of my heart against my ribs. I ended up suffering from insomnia for the whole month. But hey, I pretended to not know the reason for my poor sleep. Spoiler alert: I did. And sometimes my heart is suddenly inundated and heavy for no reason at all. I just get this pang in my chest and I start thinking about all the bad things in my life right now. Man, holding tears in public is no easy feat. There was once I cried on the bus home.
Everyone around me always looks so happy and free. They have their own nice lives, they’re doing so many things out in this world, they’re studying hard, they’re having so much fun hanging out with their friends, they’re getting boyfriends and girlfriends and living out their own youthful romance. They have fun with their siblings. I hear people talk about their siblings, how they do fun activities together. I hear about how their siblings have all gone to university, lead their own lives. And somehow, that hole in my gut grows wider. I find myself at the brink of knowing and unknowing every day. I am envious of them. I want a sibling I can count on. I want to know that I have someone to talk to and feel safe with. I want to live a life free of worries.
All around me, I see friends with actual functional family relations. “Oh, my dad is picking me up”, they say. I am ever so tempted to say, “Hey, my dad is picking me up too.” I wish I had the privilege of growing up with a present figure in my life. My mom is great. But sometimes I kinda hoped little me had a dad to talk to, you know?
I don’t think I’ve really genuinely felt happy for a while now. I smile, yeah, but all my monsters come running back. I so desperately want to unravel them with someone, but I am a coward.
I dread coming home every day. I used to sprint home at any opportunity I got. Now I find myself purposely dragging out the time I spend in school just so that I can stay out a while longer. Home is where I should feel secure (In a mental sense? Not physical). I don’t feel relaxed. I find myself putting on a show for them to see, to hide the fact that I am crumbling underneath. Because if I do, I know all my feelings will get worse.
I wonder what my friends would have to say if they ever knew. Maybe I’ll bear witness to the pity in their eyes. Sometimes I think about how nice it would be if I ceased to exist. Or what if I had been another dimension. I think in that one, I’d be happy.
I find myself thinking a lot about the future. How will things change? How will I handle all my burdens and responsibilities? In that future, I probably won’t have a life of my own. And that I’m scared of. I want to hang out with friends into the late night. I want to go on international adventures with friends. I want to indulge myself in romance. But I can’t. Not in that future. Sometimes I imagine a different future, one where I am free to frolic in the fields. And I really hope that comes true. But I catch myself before I get too deep in those thoughts. Inhumane.
F_ck this. I just want to run away, climb up the tallest building and give this f_cking world the largest middle finger. I am so tired.
Sorry if all this is so cryptic and out of context. I’ve been bottling this in for a good half a year and yet I’m still too much of a chicken to give full details. Makes everything too real.",,3,,,,,

First of all, thank you for taking the courage to share with us your struggles and being so authentic with us on this platform, I really appreciate that and commend you for your bravery.
I want you to know that I’m truly sorry to hear that you’ve been going through such a challenging time; and does indeed it takes a lot of strength to share these feelings, and I appreciate your openness. The emotions you’re experiencing are incredibly valid, and I can see that you’ve been carrying a heavy burden for quite some time.
It sounds like you’re dealing with a multitude of difficult emotions, from anxiety and sadness to feelings of envy and isolation. The weight of these emotions can be overwhelming, especially when you feel like you have to put on a mask for those around you. Your longing for a sense of security, a confidant, and a more carefree life is palpable in your words.
I want to emphasize that seeking support is a courageous and important step. It might be helpful to talk to someone you trust about what you’re going through, whether it’s a friend, family member, or a mental health professional. You don’t have to manage these feelings alone, and there are people who care and want to help. For a start, you can actually try to contact the nearest Family Service Centre to your home, so that you can start speaking to a professional about receiving support. Alternatively, I encourage you to try speaking a professional online at either one of these options:

Thank you for sharing your pain and struggles with us here, I want to acknowledge the depth of what you’re sharing, and I can see that you’re experiencing a profound emotional connection to your past. It takes a great deal of courage to explore these feelings, and I appreciate your vulnerability in expressing them. It’s very common for memories and emotions from the past to resurface in such powerful ways, and the impact can indeed feel very real, like a tangible loss.
Grief and nostalgia are intricate aspects of the human experience (which we all experience at some point in our lives), and they can be particularly painful when associated with a past that holds significant meaning for you. The ache in your heart, the longing, and the tears are all valid expressions of the complex emotions you’re experiencing. Sometimes, moving on doesn’t necessarily mean forgetting or severing ties with the past; rather, it’s about finding a way to integrate those experiences into your present self.
Your reactions to certain smells and the intensity of the emotions you’re feeling are not uncommon. Each person’s journey is unique, and the process of healing and moving forward is different for everyone. It might be helpful for you to explore these feelings further, perhaps with the support of loved ones or a professional who help you process these feelings in a safe and nonjudgmental place. We all grieve differently, and that is normal.
I want to encourage you, your experiences are valid, and it’s okay to feel the way you do. It doesn’t make you abnormal; it makes you human. If you ever feel the need for additional support or guidance, I encourage you to seek it out through the nearest Family Service Centre by talking to a professional, or have a try with any of these online options:

6796,Disgusted by myself,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/disgusted-by-myself/6796,Seeking Help,"needadvice, emotions",5534,user925,User,,9585,1,"I am a 15 y/o currently studying in a neighbourhood school. Next year I will be taking my o lvls and determining my future plans. However, this fact unsettles me because I am very lost in my life…
Sometimes I feel like I shouldn’t even be complaining at all. My conditions are much better than my peers. I am a high achieving girl, top scorer in my cohort for the past 3 years, Student Council President/Head Prefect, have a reliable family and financially stable. I have more opportunities than my peers. I represent my school for competitions and participate in educational programmes. However, I just feel more and more lost as years go by as I realised I do not actually know where I am heading to. All my peers tell me I am perfect, but I am not. I have my own insecurities too.
Sure, I have hobbies, have ambitious dreams of becoming someone big, someone that can leave a legacy and impact others in need. To get there, I have a goal to get into top schools, top unis. But I am not so sure now.
I compare myself to others A LOT. I’ve been reminding myself not to do so (I understand it’s mentally taxing when one keeps comparing one’s life and feels inadequate, even though everyone has different life circumstances) I set expectations for myself. Die die exams must A1. Die die must be top scorer. If not how to get into top school? How to even do well and fit in well? I am already at a disadvantage by being in a not well known neighbourhood school.
Are those my own expectations? Or I have someone lived into others’ views of me being ´perfect girl’?
Most people like to be look up to, to be praised, to receive awards, to be the star. I feel like I had too much of these to the extent that I feel insecure that if I do something wrong, if I don’t set the new best record in my school, I will be forgotten, not longer the star. Yes, I am addicted to people’s affirmation. This is to the extent that I get jealous and upset when my best friend (also a top scorer) does better than me. I began to viewed him more of a competitor/enemy but he’s still super nice to me. Sometimes I am disgusted and ashamed of my thoughts. What leadership does that show when I don’t even know how to prioritise other’s (or majority) over my selfishness?
I try to distract myself by keeping my schedules booked. Out of kindness, my teachers and peers keep reminding me to rest— they are scared that I tire myself out. I did enjoy having schedules booked, but now I do feel tired, but I am not sure whether that was influenced by what others think of me. Isn’t she tired? We must offload her! Perhaps give others the opportunity to (do something) instead?
My desire for excellence has driven me until the top, but it seems to be the root of all my problems and insecurities. People feel pressured by me. My ExCo members broke down because of me. I did learn, I became patient. Then it feels like I am not making up-to-standard progress as a SC President as compared to my seniors. It feels like I am failing all my peers and juniors who look up to me. It feels like I am not ready to lead.
I keep my social circle small too, too tired of pleasing others and trying to fit in (I don’t play games, don’t watch TikTok, don’t know latest trends, don’t do Gen Z slang) it feels like I belong to a different generation!! I am aware of being left out because of who I am. I am aware of being left out because I am too afraid to try open up a conversation, for fear I will make the other person feel uncomfortable. I’m becoming more introverted, less willing to share my thoughts and feelings. I know that’s wrong too, because reaching out would be better than holding all these toxic in my body. But what would my friends think of me? Me and my selfishness? My best friend has a larger social circle than me, he’s a natural with people! What would he think of me? I don’t want to cause any harm to people. I should be a source of positivity, an inspiration, not negative energy.
I tried to read up on self care and self growth but the points mentioned just can’t sink into me…
Back to the topic of being lost. I don’t know what I want, or what is a good direction for me when I grow up. I wanted to be a doctor since young. It’s definitely a stressful job but I don’t mind. What I am afraid is the competition. How will I change my mindset and garner enough strength to push myself forward instead of focusing on all my insecurities? I am a messed up person in a ‘perfect’ shell. Sometimes I hate myself.
So sorry to take up so much time, I understand that you could be spending this time more meaningfully with your loved ones instead of reading someone else rant about their life. Thank you so much for your patience!",,2,,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to share with us your story, your courage to be authentic is really inspiring and I commend you for that.
I want you to know that your feelings and struggles are valid, and it’s okay to express them. I can see that despite your achievements and the positive aspects of your life, you’re facing some internal challenges that are causing you distress.
Firstly, I want to acknowledge that the pressure you’re feeling is a heavy burden, and it’s okay to seek support. It seems like you’re carrying a lot of expectations, both from yourself and others, and that can be overwhelming. I affirm you - it’s okay to have dreams and ambitions, but it’s also important to find a balance and not let them become a source of constant stress.
Comparing yourself to others is a common struggle (happens to us therapists too!), but I’d like to gently remind you that everyone’s journey is unique - yours too! Please know that your worth is not solely determined by your achievements or how others perceive you. It’s okay to ask for help, to not have all the answers, and to take breaks when needed.
The desire for excellence and the fear of not meeting expectations can indeed be stressful. It might be helpful to explore the root of these expectations—are they truly yours, or are they influenced by external pressures? Reflecting on this might help you gain a clearer understanding of your own values and aspirations.
Jealousy and competition can be challenging emotions to grapple with, but I’m glad to hear that you recognise them in your life - not many people can have that level of self-awareness, so I commend you for that too. I’d like you to know that it’s okay to feel these emotions, but acknowledging them and working on understanding their root cause can help you manage them more effectively.
Taking care of yourself in this period is so important, both mentally and physically. It’s definitely not selfish to prioritize your personal well-being! For example, setting boundaries, even if it means saying no sometimes, is really important for maintaining a healthy balance. What are some ways you can set boundaries in your life?
As for your future plans, I assure you that it’s completely normal not to have everything figured out at 15 It’s a process that takes time, and it’s okay to explore different paths. If the idea of being a doctor is causing stress due to competition, perhaps you could consider other fields that align with your interests and values.
Remember, you’re not alone, and seeking support from friends, family, or a counselor can be beneficial, as they can provide guidance, a listening ear, and help you work through these challenges. For example, you can approach a trusted adult or even a counsellor at a nearby Family Service Centre to talk about your stress.
Last but not least, you are not a “messed up person.” You (and all of us!) are a complex individual facing challenges, and it’s okay to be kind to yourself during this journey. If you ever need someone to talk to, whether it’s a friend, family member, or a professional, don’t hesitate to reach out. We are here to support you.

Firstly, I would like to say that I see YOU beyond your achievements. I see someone considerate of others. I see a person trying to be a good role model for others. I see an individual trying her best to make the most out of this life we have. And finally, I see someone with much strength and tenacity. You are much more than your accolades. That’s perhaps what your close friends and teachers see in you to have placed you in their social circle and in leadership positions.
It is ok to be lost. It is part of the growing up process and it is really part of being human. And it is ok to walk your own path in life and figure out what’s right for you. You will make mistakes along the way and that’s ok. It is part of learning and figuring out who we are and how we want to interact with the world.
I encourage you to try new things especially things which you are not familiar with and yet enjoy. Rock climbing? Pottery? Volunteering to give tuition to disadvantaged children? Finding ways to give to others is often a good way to learn about ourselves and connect with others. I hope you will continue this journey of self-discovery and let us know how you are doing along the way
Sharing this poem with you. It reminds us that just because someone likes to explore doesn’t mean they are lost. And that those who lost their way can still bounce back in life.
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.

a huge part of my stress comes from academics. due to this stress that feels never-ending yet keeps piling, it has made me feel incompetent and horrible about myself. it also doesn’t help that i am unable to properly express my feelings. over the years i have conditioned myself to not express any feelings, and now i think i am just numb. Many times i was hoping i could cry & feel better after however i just can’t - no matter how badly i want to. when i can’t express myself somehow i start feeling it in my body like chest tightness and i get so frustrated because it’s trapped in my body. to make it worse, recently i am starting to experience episodes where i would suddenly become breathless along with some worry that i just cannot seem to figure out what is it.
I also hate night time now, because its always at night that i suffer most with my thoughts. on some days i do feel that i am better off dead. i am introverted and get very anxious, so while i have few friends i also stopped socialising. i really don’t know what to do, i feel like giving up yet at the same time i do not have the courage to.",,2,,,,,

Hi @abcded
I strongly believe that you do deserve help. I think it’s a common myth and misconception that you only seek help if you’re at wit’s ends but a lot of times working on issues early can help prevent the issues to spiral even futher out of control. Everyone deserves for their issues and struggles to be validated and not dismissed as trivial/ not important.
I hope this gives you a little nudge to want to see help, I wish you well and do let us know if you do decide to seek help/ require some resources on where to seek help.

Thank you for sharing your feelings with us, I appreciate your willingness to be vulnerable with us on this platform. It certainly takes a lot of courage, and I commend you for that.
Firstly, I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re experiencing such a difficult time, and again, I appreciate your courage in reaching out. It’s entirely okay to seek help, and you absolutely deserve support. I want to affirm you, your feelings are valid, and we are here to support you.
It sounds like you’re having a very tough time managing your studies and also not being able to regulate or express your emotions well, and I can tell that it’s difficult for you to even cry at this point because you feel numb. I can imagine that these feelings are stuck within you, and it makes sense to feel frustrated because of this stuckness.
I also can understand how the night time causes you to become more anxious, especially with your thoughts. I am so sorry to hear that it’s been so tough for you and it’s almost unbearable.
I’m just wondering, have you considered talking to someone you trust about what you’re going through? It could be a friend, family member, or someone else you feel comfortable confiding in. Additionally, have you thought about seeking professional help, perhaps from a counselor or therapist?
Given the academic stress you’re facing, I suggest breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This might help alleviate the feeling of being overwhelmed. Also, incorporating relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or mindfulness, could be beneficial for managing stress and the physical symptoms you’ve described.
I hope that you would also try to reach out for help especially with the regulation of emotions, it will be great if you could approach a counsellor to process these emotions together. You could either try to talk to a professional near you (Family Service Centre) or try an online option here:

I am the eldest of 4 siblings, youngest being 11M. My parents are very strict, quite pious. Physical abuse has always been in my life since young, even my younger brother when he was a baby has been beaten before. Normal stuffs like when we made a mess or lie or anything, we would get beaten and shouted at. Even now sometimes I would still get shouted at. I would flinch whenever someone look like theyre gonna hurt me or shout. Is that childhood trauma? I bet everyone goes through that.

I do have a bf of 7 years. but i dont tell him much about stuffs. stuffs like me having suicidal thoughts. my parents like to shout at us and make us feel guilty about even going out with friends. they would always remind us to put family first, yet treat us that way.they would sometimes degrade us too. i don’t remember a single memory that theyre proud of me. me being the eldest, i feel like i dont have room to breathe. i have to always think abt my actions affecting my siblings. i just quit my job due to work environment and didnt applied any atm as i know my mom needs help in cleaning the house etc, but she would still nag most day. she rarely thanks me for anything that ive done. yet makes noise when i go out to meet a ‘friend’(bf, my parents doesnt allow rs). i have self harm before few years ago due to same reasons. being in this house makes me feel suffocated. i find it hard to communicate with people, i dont find joy in doing what i like anymore. whenever the nagging starts, the shouting, in my mind has always been to just end it. i had this thought before. to end my siblings life and thn mine, so they dont have to go through what i did. but i know its wrong. and they have a life ahead of them. i know im the bad one. i know it may not sound like hell?, but this place that is home, is hell to me on most days. sometimes i do feel okay, sometimes i just feel like maybe im just overreacting. am i though? i dont think i am depressed. am i lonely? but i do have a bf. i do have a home, i do have parents. but why do i feel like leaving? why do i feel this way? i feel like a failure(dropped out student). a burden. i dont have anyone that i can talk to. having suicidal thoughts and stuff like tht doesnt make one suicidal right? im actually just exaggerating right?",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles on this platform, I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult time. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your experiences, and I want to validate your feelings. What you’ve described is indeed a challenging and painful situation.
I acknowledge that the environment you’ve grown up in, with physical abuse, shouting, and guilt-tripping, can have a huge impact on your mental and emotional well-being. These experiences can indeed be classified as childhood trauma, and the feelings you’re experiencing, such as anxiety, the fear of harm, and suicidal thoughts, are significant and should not be dismissed.
It is very common for people in such situations to feel like they’re overreacting or that their experiences may not be as severe as they perceive. However, I want to assure you that your feelings are completely valid, and I want to encourage you to prioritize your mental health.
Having a supportive network is very important, and to be honest, I am very concerned that you feel you don’t have anyone to talk to. While I’m here to offer support and listen, it’s important to consider reaching out to friends, a mental health professional, or a helpline that can support you. I would highly suggest that you walk in to a nearby Family Service Centre to ask for help, or to contact any mental health professional online:

- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT

It’s good to hear that you have a long-term boyfriend, but I understand that it may be difficult to open up to him about certain aspects of your life. Perhaps you could consider discussing your feelings with him, as he might be more understanding and supportive than you think. Communication is key in any relationship. I would like you to try out this conversation tool that might help you be more confident in discussing this topic with him.
Sometimes, feeling like a failure or a burden can be overwhelming, that is why I feel it’s so important to challenge those negative thoughts.
Here are some helpful tools that can guide you on working through the negative thoughts:
- Reframing your perspective
- Build your worth
- Gain new perspective of your life
- Be compassionate to yourself
Last but not least, I want you to know that you are not alone, and seeking help is a strength, not a weakness. Please consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a helpline as soon as you can - your well-being matters.

I don’t really know how to express my thoughts and feelings but I need a space to just pour it out. All my life I feel like I’m stuck in a place where I find myself struggling to keep afloat. I feel like people tend to disregard or not care about me because I look “ok” or “unbothered”. but I don’t blame them because I tend to be quiet and pull myself away when I don’t feel like myself. I struggled a lot growing up and went through things that I’m not exactly proud of and I don’t speak to anyone about it and kinda heal myself along the way. But it makes me think that maybe I’m just feeling numb.
One thing that use to make me happy is taking photos. I use to do photography as a hobby but now I do it as a side hustle. Well now, it used to be what I love. but now I don’t find passion in it anymore and it upsets me because that’s all I know… And to let go of that hurts because what am I supposed to do now. Everyone asked me what do i want to do actually. I don’t have an answer for that. They kept saying “it’s okay you’re young, you will figure it out”.

I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts and feelings with us here. It takes a lot of courage to open up, especially when it feels like you’ve been navigating through a challenging journey alone. I can see that you’ve faced difficult moments in your life and carried burdens silently on your own, and I can imagine how disheartening it can feel sometimes.
I’m sorry to hear that the joy you once found in photography has faded, and I can understand how discouraging that must be. It seems like there’s a struggle to find your passion and purpose, compounded by the complexity of your own experiences. It’s perfectly okay not to have all the answers right now.
Given your interest in psychology, it’s intriguing how you’re drawn to understanding the minds of others while grappling with your own uncertainties. It’s actually pretty common for those studying psychology to use it as a way to explore and make sense of their own experiences!
Have you found any aspects of your psychology studies particularly resonant or helpful in your personal journey?
Have you also found anything else in your life that you’re interested in? It might be things like animals, or cooking, or even hiking - anything! From there, you could take time to explore the interest and work on it bit by bit! Photography is a beautiful art, and you can even combine photography with your interest! For example, photography + if you have a passion for the elderly folks, you can volunteer to take photographs at events for them!
There are really so many ways it could go, don’t give up yet!
Last but not least, I would like to encourage you that sometimes it’s okay for our interests to change - we go through different seasons in life, and we experience and expect different things in these seasons, so take heart! It’s a common occurance Stay strong and keep us updated about yourself!

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with us here, it takes a lot of courage to share your personal experience here, and I respect your vulnerability in doing so. I can only imagine how lonely it is to feel uncared for by others and to have to tide through your difficulties and struggles alone, because of your tendencies that may not reflect your desire for support at times
Additionally, it’s completely understandable if you feel powerless or lost about losing passion for an activity that has journeyed with you as a source of happiness in the past. It is really difficult to reconcile the possibility of losing interest in something that used to be meaningful for you, on top of the pressure (from the self and others) to navigate the uncertainty in the future. I can only imagine how demoralizing it can get to have to grapple with uncertainty and redefine photography concurrently
It can be frustrating how long and difficult the process of understanding yourself and self-discovery can be, especially when sometimes it would seem much easier to have a silver bullet to all the problems I’m sorry that you have been struggling for quite some time now, I’m wondering if the following resources may help:
2. emotional support
- mindline’s website
- mindline’s youth website
- if talking to someone helps, for a start, you can consider online chat options with organizations such as Limitless, CPH, or ec2
3. Self-discovery/self-awareness:
- Wysa chatbot
- counselling/therapy (contrary to popular belief, counselling is not only for those with mental health concerns, but also those who want to understand themselves!)
You are very resilient for trying your best to keep going despite everything, and I hope that you’ll eventually find a safe space to understand yourself and express yourself comfortably!

Thank you for sharing with us your struggles, I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult time. I can imagine how disheartening it must feel to go through this - not being able to find comfort in anything and feeling like nothing really matters. I can hear that the sadness and fear can be very overwhelming, and I acknowledge the depth of your feelings.
I would really like to encourage you to reach out for support. Here are some suggestions:
2. Speak to a Mental Health Professional: Please do consider talking to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. They can help you explore the root causes of your distress and work towards coping strategies and a healthier mindset.
3. Connect with Supportive Friends or Family: It’s important to share your feelings with someone you trust, whether it’s a friend, family member, or someone else in your life. Sometimes social support can make a huge difference in how we cope with challenges, and having someone to talk to can provide emotional relief.
4. Explore Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation and deep breathing exercises, can help bring a sense of calmness to your mind. These techniques may not provide an immediate solution, but they can be helpful in managing distress over time.
Last but not least, if you’re in immediate distress, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a crisis helpline. Please do contact them in case of emergency or in case you find yourself in crisis:

Thank you for sharing with us your frustrations and feelings, I hear you and we are here to journey with you. I’m truly sorry to hear about the challenges you’ve been facing, and I can see that you’ve been dealing with a huge amount of stress and hardship. It sounds like you’ve been shouldering a heavy burden, both physically and emotionally, while feeling undervalued and unappreciated.
Given the physical and emotional toll, I encourage you to prioritize your well-being. I would really like you to consider seeking medical attention for your injuries and health concerns. You could also try implementing self-care routines, such as taking breaks, getting adequate rest, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, can contribute to your overall mental and physical health. One thing you can try is practicing deep breathing, to help you stay calm and focused if things get overwhelming. You can also try to this activity to declutter your mind, to give you some rest emotionally.
I also think it’s important for you to communicate your needs with your family, by having an open and honest conversation with your family about your experiences and the toll it has taken on your health. Sometimes, expressing your feelings and setting boundaries can be difficult but can help others understand your perspective and bring a more supportive environment.
Also, considering your prolonged struggle with depression, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can offer a supportive space to explore your emotions, work through past experiences, and develop coping strategies. A mental health professional can provide guidance tailored to your specific needs. There are many resources available for you to seek support. For example, reaching out to someone at the Family Service Centre nearest to your home is one option. Another way is to speak to a trained professional here online:

I’m so sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. It sounds like today’s therapy session was challenging, and I can understand how losing control and not being able to complete the work with your vulnerable child would be distressing. It’s okay to make mistakes, and I want you to know that you’re not alone in feeling overwhelmed.
Taking a photo of the notes might not be a purposeful one, and that’s okay too. It’s completely normal to feel scared or hesitant to talk to your psychologist about it, but they are there to support you. Therapists understand that everyone has moments of vulnerability and can work with you to manage through them.
I want to encourage you that you are not at fault for struggling, and it’s okay to reach out for help. Your psychologist is there to provide a safe and supportive space for you to express your thoughts and emotions. If you feel comfortable, I would encourage you to consider sharing your concerns with your psychologist. They are trained to help you through difficult moments and can work with you to find a way forward.
Perhaps in your upcoming session, you can bring up the topic and discuss this with her directly so that she can also help you to process your thoughts together.
Remember, it’s okay to ask for support and to be gentle with yourself. You’re taking steps to care for your well-being, and that is a courageous and important journey.

Hi @Jelfel
Your psychologist writes notes as a form of record keeping, it also helps make case management easier. However, if you’re feeling very uncomfortable is there any way you can discuss on a compromise or alternatives with your psychologist? But again generally writing notes help them remember/ track stuff better.

I ever told her it’s very uncomfortable and she told me before and also I know it’s for her own record so all she suggested was she would let me see her notes that she wrote for me at the end of session for 1 month but that didn’t end well too - I couldn’t sit with the fact that she was writing as I talk and it was really hard just that cuz I wanted to move forward hence I gave in a lot of times and I just can’t take it now cuz it’s been so long and I admit now I have to face it otherwise if it happens again she won’t see me in person anymore just because of this fear is ridiculous to do what I did and stop therapy cuz it’s not going to help - just imagine keeping on repeating this but not addressing the issue hence I really needed to face it not my usual thing to do but so I took that leap and emailed her on this but at the same time I cried non stop in the MRT and I was trying to soothe myself cuz a lot of people were just looking at me so embarrassing

Sometimes she doesn’t want me to see it and I always question why like did she judge me and not want me to see or did she wrote something that she didn’t want me to know and her way of saying no is so firm and direct til I feel so wrong as a client to ask not saying firm and direct is wrong but saying if it’s firm and direct it can be hurtful at times and just imagine leaving session feeling session is not good and that’s been the case for me and I always need my therapist to say it’s been a good session so that I feel reassured

Sometimes we can’t change the situation and circumstances but through skills building we can learn to be more tolerable and accepting towards our situation. It’ll definitely be very uncomfortable and it’ll take time, sometimes it’ll feel that we aren’t making any progress but continue to push through.

No leh she never really explore it yet with me
And yes I know I can’t change the circumstances and I need to learn skills yet when I go to therapy, I haven’t really learn any skills and when I say this to my therapist she say it takes time and I am trying to be patient with myself and to push through too but I really don’t understand how long I must wait or go through how many times then she will teach me skills - the only skills she taught me was grounding techniques… how am I supposed to use it when I lose control ? I don’t understand cuz when I lose control I literally lose control of everything and I just sit and cry and yell
I think when I lose control I just hope people can help me by being with me and treating it as a child melting down, don’t really need to say anything much cuz I really can’t control crying and yelling and I won’t be able to hear whatever people say so calm me down then say something soothing and hug me to tell me is ok
I felt like you guys hear me out a lot which I really needed it cuz a lot of times my friends though thy say they are for me to hear me out but when I needed them they normally just say they can’t help but I don’t really need help, I just want to be heard and understood hence I find it super helpful in this space esp when I’m in a rough patch like this kind of situation and sometimes is really I need advice yet they can’t give me helpful advice hence here is a great place too",,2,,,,,

My partner and I had many fights and as neither of us were in a good state to resolve issues, he asked to resolve the fights only after his stressful period. So our fights accumulated. At a point, unsure of what exactly attributed to it because there are many external things going on, I reached a burnout - feeling apathy, exhausted and demotivated. I did try (in a mild attempt) to communicate it to the people around me, including my family and friends, by saying I am exhausted, but maybe due to their own situations, my words were minimized and unheard. As such, I started avoiding everyone around me. I probably ruminated on this relationship and due to a warped perspective that perhaps the relationship was the reason of my exhaustion, I communicated that I want to take a break to focus on me. Yet ever since the break, I felt worse and guilty for the selfish decision. I still feel burned out and as he was my support, I want to confide in him whenever he reaches out. As I am trying to work through the burnout, is it selfish of me to want support from him?

First of all, thank you for sharing your struggles here on this platform, your concerns are real and valid - we are here to journey with you.
I can see that you’ve been going through a challenging time, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling conflicted about the decisions you’ve made. Burnout can really impact our ability to make clear decisions, and it seems like you’ve been doing your best to work through a difficult situation.
I think that it’s important for you to know that seeking support is not selfish. Everyone goes through tough times, and reaching out for help is a healthy and necessary part of managing our well-being. In a relationship, it’s normal to lean on each other for support during challenging periods. It’s okay to communicate your feelings and share what you’re going through.
Considering your burnout and the impact it has had on your relationship, it might be beneficial to have an open and honest conversation with your partner. Let him know what you’ve been experiencing, both emotionally and physically, and express your need for support. Relationships are a partnership, and being vulnerable with each other can strengthen your connection.
It’s also important to prioritize your own well-being during this time. If you feel that your burnout is affecting your ability to make decisions, please consider seeking support from a mental health professional who can support you emotionally.

Thank you for sharing with us here on this platform, and I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a challenging time. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your feelings, and I want you to know that your struggles are valid. It sounds like you’re experiencing a range of emotions and thoughts that are affecting your well-being.
I want to encourage you to recognize that seeking help is a brave step, and reaching out to others is a sign of strength, not weakness. Sometimes, understanding what’s going on within ourselves can be complex, and having support can make a huge difference. If your previous attempts to seek help didn’t bring the relief you were hoping for, it might be worth trying again or exploring different avenues.
We don’t necessarily need to know what’s “wrong” with us before we seek help - the reason why we reach out for support is precisely because we do not know what is happening within us. Many of us go through similar struggles, and there are professionals and support networks available to assist you. If you’re comfortable, consider talking to a mental health professional who can provide support for you.
I encourage you to try reaching out to a Family Service Centre near your home, or speak to a mental health professional online first:
- Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
- ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
I also want to encourage you not to give up. Sometimes when we think that we have sought help but it does not seem to work, regardless of the reason, please continue to look for someone who can help you. I acknowledge that you are here seeking support, and we are here to support you but I would love for you to speak to a mental health professional who can help you truly become better Please do consider reaching out to any of the options shared above, and do update us on how the conversation went.
Remember, your feelings are real, and you deserve the help and support necessary to navigate through them. You’re not faking anything, and you are not the problem. It’s okay not to have all the answers right now. Take small steps, reach out to those around you, and consider seeking professional help to work through these emotions.

Thank you for sharing with us your thoughts and for being so vulnerable here with us on this platform. I can sense how remorseful you feel when you think about how much of your life has passed by and you still feel like you have not achieved anything great. It sounds like you had a difficult time growing up and I can imagine how painful it was for you to think about your life. I empathise with you, your feelings are all valid and anyone else in your place would feel the same too.
I would like us to take some time to process this together through reflection. If you have time, I encourage you to think about these:
2. Can you identify any patterns in your thoughts or behaviors that you’d like to change or understand better?
3. What does “achievement” mean to you? How do you define what is it?
In the meantime, I would like to also encourage you with these suggestions:
- Practice self-compassion: Please do treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend. Be gentle with yourself when facing your stressors and difficulties, it is truly a delicate moment.
- Positive Statements: I also encourage you to speak positively to yourself, and challenge your negative thoughts with positive statements. You can try this activity here for a start: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Journaling: Try writing down your thoughts and emotions can be a therapeutic way to process and make sense of your feelings. It can also help identify recurring patterns, or thoughts that are repeating.
- Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: I highly encourage you to try mindfulness meditation or deep breathing exercises to stay in the present moment and reduce stress and anxiety. These activities can be very helpful in regulating your emotions if it gets overwhelming for you.
Last but not least, I really encourage you to seek support and consider reaching out to a friend, or family member, or a mental health professional to discuss your feelings and process your thoughts together. When we connect with others, perhaps they can provide valuable insights and emotional support.

Thanks for sharing how you’re currently feeling. I sense that you’re a very reflective person and you often look back to your past to see what could have been done better. While this is a good quality, I hope you can learn to do it in moderation so that you don’t let your present pass you by. Everyone has made mistakes in their past and I hope you know you’re not the only one. While we can’t redo all the wrongs in the past, the best that we can do is to take all the learnings from the past into the future, to try avoid making the same mistakes.
Some people say that 20s are the best time of their lives and I’m excited for you to enter this new life phase. While it is true that you might not be able to do some of the things that teenage-Wira wished to do in your 20s, there are still plenty that you can do in your 20s.
Perhaps it’s also time for you to try new things that you can only do while you’re in your 20s. Do you have a list of things that you want to do or accomplish?

Thanks for sharing with us your thoughts, I really appreciate the vulnerability
I can hear that you’re carrying a lot of emotions and reflections on your past experiences, and that’s completely valid. It sounds like the challenges you faced with your classmates in college had a significant impact on your path, and it’s understandable that those memories are still affecting you. It takes courage to open up about these feelings, and I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to confront and process them.
Regret can be a heavy burden, but I want you to remember that everyone makes decisions based on the information and circumstances they have at the time. Your choice to step away from engineering was a decision you made to work around a challenging situation. It’s also clear that your passion for engineering still lingers within you, and that’s a powerful realization!
It’s never too late to explore your dreams and pursue what you’re truly passionate about. It took me years before I finally found out what I really enjoyed and was passionate about too. And (fun fact!) I was actually from engineering too! I did a whole diploma course (3 full years) on engineering but I didn’t pursue it - but was it a waste? Not at all. Although I don’t remember what I learned (haha) I still had wonderful memories with my friends at that time. Nothing is a waste if you don’t let it become a waste
Your new dream is a great step forward, and while it may feel overwhelming, taking small, consistent actions can help you move in the direction you want! It’s okay to acknowledge the regret while also recognizing the potential for growth and new opportunities. There’s nothing wrong with feeling regretful, and it’s completely normal to feel regretful too. I encourage you to embrace that sense of regret and use it to fuel you forward, instead of holding you back

Example 1:
I’ve recently taken the flu vaccine for some travels happening soon. After a few days most of my symptoms(body ache, sore throat and runny nose) were mostly gone and weren’t that bad. But after going to school 3 days ago my symptoms got worse, and today I can barely talk without my throat hurting. My father keeps on telling me that my symptoms are from the vaccine but I know my body better than that. The sore throat wasn’t as bad and I was healing before it got worse today. I just want to tell him to shut up cause he’s been doing this type of thing to me all my life and I’m so tired of being downplayed like that. Am I wrong to feel this way?
Example2:
I have gotten into a fight with best friend. And a mutual friend who has been ‘neutral’ was my main support system through it. However, everytime I’ve brought it up she keeps on telling me she’s been through the same thing with that same friend and kind of implying that I’m overreacting. She doesn’t want to tell me what even happen when she fell out with that friend before getting close again so I don’t even know what she went through. But it just pisses me off that she tells me ‘she went through the exact same thing’ when she sides with that friend though she’s ‘neutral’ and doesn’t even give me decent feedback and help with my reflections and rather just brushes my feelings aside with ‘Bad things happen and bad happens’ when I’m being vulnerable to the only person who will actually try to hear me out.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us here, I appreciate your vulnerability.
I just want to say - It’s absolutely normal to feel frustrated and upset when someone dismisses your feelings or imposes their own conclusions without taking the time to understand your perspective. In both of your examples, it seems like you’re experiencing a lack of validation and empathy, and it’s entirely valid for you to feel the way you do.
In the first example, your father’s insistence that your symptoms are solely from the vaccine, despite your own awareness of your body, can be disheartening. I would feel the same way too if I were you. It’s okay to express your feelings and let him know that you appreciate his concern, but you also want your experiences and observations to be acknowledged.
In the second example, your frustration with your friend’s response is also understandable. Feeling heard and understood is so important, especially when going through a challenging situation with a friend. It might be helpful to communicate directly with your friend, expressing your need for support and understanding, and sharing your feelings about how her responses have made you feel.
In general, healthy communication involves active listening and mutual understanding. It’s okay to assert yourself and communicate your needs in these situations You deserve to have your feelings acknowledged and respected! If these patterns persist, consider seeking support from others who are more willing to listen and empathize with your experiences.

That’s a really good question!
The idea that “you are what you think and believe you are” is a concept that aligns with certain aspects of psychology, particularly within the realms of self-perception and self-fulfilling prophecies. However, I need to clarify that this notion is not an absolute truth and doesn’t capture the full complexity of human behavior and cognition. Humans are complex creatures
In psychology, there are several related concepts to what you shared:
2. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: This happens when an person’s belief or expectation about a situation influences their behavior in a way that ultimately makes the belief come true. For example, if someone believes they are bad at math and approaches math tasks with a negative mindset, they may not invest the necessary effort to improve, thus fulfilling their own expectation.
3. Self-Concept: This refers to the way individuals perceive themselves, encompassing beliefs, attitudes, and feelings about their own identity, abilities, and worth. A person’s self-concept can influence their behavior and interactions with the world.
4. Cognitive Distortions: These are patterns of irrational and negative thinking that can contribute to emotional distress. Believing one is “stupid” at math, despite evidence to the contrary, might be considered a cognitive distortion.
There are also external factors, objective skills and abilities, and the influence of others also play a huge role in shaping an individual’s reality. Believing you are capable and having a positive mindset can certainly contribute to success and well-being, but it doesn’t negate the importance of objective skills, effort, and external circumstances.
So yes, while there is a psychological basis for the idea that our thoughts and beliefs can influence our behavior and experiences, it’s not a simple or absolute equation.
We need to balance positive thinking with a realistic assessment of our abilities, seek external feedback, and take concrete actions to achieve goals If negative thoughts or beliefs are causing distress, it’ll be good for us to explore these with a mental health professional who can provide support and guidance!
Hope this clarifies some of your questions!",,3,,9375,,9375.0,

The problem is how often I feel like crying because of how often these negative feelings overwhelm me.

Thank you for sharing with us your concerns on this platform. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re experiencing such overwhelming emotions, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. It takes a lot of strength to reach out and share your struggles. It sounds like you’re going through an emotionally stressful time, especially with the pressure of your internship and the sense of feeling lost in life.
It’s commendable that you’re not ashamed of expressing your emotions through crying, as it can be a healthy release. However, I understand that the frequency of these overwhelming feelings is taking a toll on you both physically and mentally. Breaking that cycle can be helpful, and I’m here to offer some suggestions that might help until you can discuss this further with your counselor:
2. Mindfulness and Deep Breathing: Taking a few moments to focus on your breath can help ground you in the present moment. Deep, slow breaths can calm your nervous system and provide a sense of control over your emotions. Some tools that you can try too (Click on each!) :
- Mindfulness
- Deep breathing exercise
- Declutter your mind
3. Journaling: Consider keeping a journal to write down your thoughts and emotions. This can be a therapeutic way to process what you’re going through and gain insights into the patterns of your feelings. You can also use these questions to help you process the negative thoughts - Helpful Questions to Counter Negative Thoughts when Journalling
4. Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself during these challenging times. Acknowledge that it’s okay to feel the way you do and treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend.
5. Physical Activity: Engaging in regular physical activity can have a positive impact on your mood and overall well-being. It doesn’t have to be intense; even a short walk or some gentle stretching can make a difference.
6. Reach Out for Support: If you have friends or family you feel comfortable talking to, consider reaching out to them. Sometimes, sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust can provide valuable support.
Remember, these suggestions are meant to offer some relief in the short term. It’s important to discuss your experiences and emotions with your counselor during your upcoming session to explore more specific strategies and support In the meantime, please take care of yourself and update us on how you’re doing!

I had started to see my partner that is from another SEA country, once in June, Jul over just 1-3 days each and once in August where my partner came to visit over National Day week and I later decided to go back with my partner for two weeks. We had just been Instagram friends chatting randomly once in awhile, since Jul 2022 and we never got the chance to meet up until only in June when I was went to visit with my family and got the chance to hang out over drinks. We never got to really discuss and talk about our relationship if it was indeed a relationship or how we were going to move forth with it. However, we had become closer after these three months of knowing each other better and everyday video calls and texting whenever we’re not physically together.
I went over recently in October to visit while my friends were also going to visit and spent time together. However, it had begun a week or two before I went over whereby my partner felt quite distant and he started to change. Even when I was there with my partner, he felt less caring and uninterested, unlike before. I had decided one of the days, that I was going to ask my partner what was going to happen to us, especially when my partner had just got an job offer in Maldives. I had agreed that him getting a job in Maldives while I’m in Singapore is not going to solve the distance between us as my partner had already found it hard and something that doesn’t make much sense for him between our two home countries since my partner prefers more physical interaction ultimately too. My partner also suggested that we could still remain in contact as friends and if ever someone else comes along, I could still go ahead.
When I left and came back to Singapore, I had still responded to my partner’s messages casually trying not to have any feelings/emotions and attachment. However, sometimes I think of the negative side of my partner of how uninterested and less caring during the most recent times. I was upset that my partner could not even talk to me face to face in person properly even until we left each other at the airport. I had decided to have a video call a week after and we cleared things up more but still staying as friends. We still messaged a little now and then, and just go silent for awhile as well. I decided I didn’t want to involve my partner as much and didn’t want to still communicate much with my partner but my partner asked on the recent Saturday about my job application that went the final round. Eventually, I gave my partner an update about it.
Apart from all of these, this has definitely got to be the reason I have had sleepless nights or sleep and wake up middle of the night thinking a lot about it. My partner probably had it so easy, as already had the thought of not wanting this anymore and just being friends but decided to tell my so much later, hence my partner could also be so carefree and happy. My partner had even thought of coming to Singapore to tell me, which made me confused why. My partner has been texting casually since I got back but after one week, it has been on and off and not as casual and friendly as before. I keep thinking if I should really still text as friends while I still feel hurt about some negative feelings. I do feel I may be bad for not texting and leaving no contact but I shouldnt as well. I keep having bad sleep because all of these that I keep stressing over.
I am in a very bad situation of struggling and stressing over multiple job interviews trying to seek and secure a new job as I had been affected by a layoff in Jul.",,2,,,,,

First of all, thank you for sharing your concerns and feelings with us so openly on this platform. I appreciate your honesty. I can see that you’re grappling with complex emotions and uncertainties surrounding your relationship with your partner who is from another SEA country. The fluctuating dynamics, from the initial closeness and connection to the recent distance and detachment, have left you feeling disoriented and burdened with emotional strain; and this is completely understandable.
I’d like to encourage you that it is normal to experience a range of feelings in such a situation, especially when there are so many uncertainties about the status and future of the relationship. The inconsistency in your partner’s behavior and the challenge of transitioning from a more intimate connection to friendship can really be quite taxing, especially when there are still feelings of hurt within the relationship.
I completely empathise with your experience - from the mix of emotions, coupled with the stress of job interviews and the impact of a recent layoff; all these can undoubtedly amplify feelings of uncertainty and emotional distress. It’s understandable that the ongoing back-and-forth in communication and the ambiguity about maintaining contact can add to your mental and emotional burden.
Managing such emotional weight while dealing with job-related stress is undoubtedly overwhelming. I would like to encourage you to take some time for self-care and introspection, allowing yourself to process your emotions at your own pace. There are a few things you can do to take care of yourself, and here are some tools that might help:
2. Practice mindfulness - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Declutter your mind - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
4. Reframe your thoughts - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
I feel that in this turbulent time, it is important for you to think about your emotional wellbeing and consider what feels most comfortable for you regarding maintaining communication with your partner - this could be a step toward relieving some of the emotional stress. I also encourage you, perhaps you could try to establish clear boundaries that respect your feelings and mental health too.
It would also be great if you could seek support from trusted friends, family, or a professional, who can offer you a space to share your thoughts and feelings and gain insights that could assist in navigating these complex emotions and decisions.
Last but not least, please do prioritize your own mental health and well-being amidst these challenging circumstances Give yourself permission to take the time you need to process and heal from these emotional difficulties.

I think you were already invested emotionally during the talking stages and when you went to visit …but because without a very clear definition to the budding relationship, and when you guys decided it to end it, the closeness had been built. It sounded like you are more emotionally invested + bonded to your partner than they were. This isn’t your fault but probably the reason you are feeling extra hurt when your partner already “moved on” faster. I’d suggest you cut off ALL communication for the time-being, and lean on your other friends/loved ones for support rather than this person. Maybe block them online if you have to. You’ll be able to think more rationally, and even though going thru a breakup is always hard, you might see what happened in a more logical way when your emotions are not clouding.
Also try to add some self-care or happy activities into your day and I’m sure your friends will be happy to take you out to recover from the breakup too LDR is always a challenging situation that must have an end goal/timeline and both parties have to align for it to work. After you heal and when you are rational, you can make judgements and still decide later on if you want to continue pursuing the relationship. All the best!!",,2,,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to share with us your experiences and concerns. I’m truly sorry to hear about the deep struggles you’re experiencing. Your pain and the weight of carrying these burdens, especially when your family doesn’t seem to understand, must be incredibly difficult. It takes immense strength to have survived and coped with these challenges for so long, and I commend you for the courage to reach out.
Let’s continue to process this a little more:
2. Have you found any healthy coping strategies that offer even temporary relief during these difficult times?
3. Have you ever considered reaching out to a mental health professional or support group who might better understand and support you through these complex issues?
I can imagine that the dismissive attitude from your family must be incredibly disheartening, especially when your cry for help was met with misunderstanding and scolding. Feeling like a burden can deepen the emotional pain you’re already enduring. It’s so understandable that you’re exhausted from wearing a façade and hiding your true feelings.
I want to encourage you further that you are important, and you are strong. It’s so important to recognize that your struggles are valid, and they go beyond academic stress or lack of sleep. The emotional toll and the impact on your mental health, including the experience of sleep paralysis and hallucinations, deserve understanding and proper attention.

Thank you for sharing with us how you feel and some of your struggles. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a challenging time. It’s a brave step to share your feelings here with us, and I commend you for your courage. Dealing with mental health issues, especially when medication side effects contribute to distress, can be incredibly tough - I can imagine how difficult it is for you.
It makes sense to feel emptiness and depression despite the efforts - and facing challenges with weight gain, is undoubtedly distressing. I think it is important to communicate your struggles, and I hear that you’ve tried reaching out to your mum. I’m sorry that you feel unheard, and it can be frustrating when those around us may not fully understand.
Considering the complexity of your situation, it’s advisable to speak with a mental health professional about your concerns, including the impact of medication on your mental well-being and the challenges you’re facing with your weight. They can provide guidance on how to manage these aspects effectively. Additionally, discussing your feelings of unsafety when not taking the medication is crucial, and a mental health professional can help navigate this concern.
Have you considered talking to a counselor or therapist about your experiences? They can provide a safe space for you to express your emotions and work collaboratively with you to explore coping strategies.
I understand that it might feel overwhelming sometimes, so please do keep these numbers and contact them in case of emergency or in case you find yourself in crisis:
- SOS: 1-767
- SOS whatsapp: Share on WhatsApp
- -IMH - 63892222
In the meantime, I hope that you will use these resources to help you manage these feelings, especially when it becomes overwhelming:
- Practice mindfulness - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Have some Self-compassion - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Use this Guided meditation - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Try this relaxation tool - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Last but not least, managing emptiness is not just about filling our lives with things to do, but it’s about finding purpose. But in order to find purpose, sometimes we need to ‘declutter’ our minds and root issues before we can truly know what our purposes and passions are in life. This can be done when you speak to therapist, these professionals happen to be very good at “decluttering” our minds and lives!
Remember that you don’t have to navigate this alone, and seeking professional support is a huge and important step toward improving your well-being. Can you please keep us updated about what your next decision is, especially about reaching out for help? Also let us know how you’re coping.

Thank you for sharing with us your concerns and struggles. I’m truly sorry to hear about the challenges you’ve faced, and I appreciate you sharing your experiences. It sounds like you’ve encountered significant obstacles, from being diagnosed with dyslexia and diabetes at a young age to grappling with low self-esteem, fear of failure, and bullying throughout your school years.
Your perseverance, especially during the PSLE examination, and the support you received from that caring teacher are truly commendable. I can see that you have inner strength and resilience, even though you may not always recognize it.
I want to encourage you, taking steps to want to change and no longer live in fear and regret is a powerful decision! It’s so important for you to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and seeking support is a crucial part of this journey. Have you considered reaching out to professionals, such as counselors or therapists, who can provide guidance and support as you navigate through these challenges?
I understand that it is really difficult for you to go through all these struggles and we want you to receive the help you need. I would highly recommend that you try to speak to a mental health professional so that you can have the chance to work on your emotions and process your struggles together with someone who can hold a safe space for you.
I truly believe that change can happen for your life, and you are the only one who can bring the change! For change to happen, you would need to do something differently - right? Perhaps the next best step is really to speak to a mental health professional to explore what are some of your options, and to learn some wonderful strategies to help you cope with these struggles for the time being while processing your struggles.
I would highly suggest speaking to an external counsellor since the school has not been a safe space for you. You could try Family Service Centres (affordable or free!) or even an online option here:
- Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
- CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
- IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
- ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
Additionally, I would also suggest setting small, achievable goals for yourself - this can be a helpful way to gradually build confidence and work towards positive change. Sometimes, celebrating even the smallest victories along the way can make a significant impact on your self-esteem

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and worries. I hear you, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and feel the need for guidance. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these challenges, especially when they’re so intertwined and impactful. I want you to know that seeking help is a huge and positive step toward healing and finding solutions. You’re not alone in this.
Considering the complexity of your situation, a professional therapist or counselor can provide a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore these issues. Start by seeking out a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychologist, who specializes in the specific areas you mentioned—relationship issues, trauma, mental health concerns like PTSD, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. They can help you navigate and untangle these interwoven challenges.
There are various platforms and resources available to find a suitable therapist or counselor. There are a few options that I can share here with you:
2. Family service centres: SupportGoWhere
3. Online mental health options:
a. Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless

4. You can also seek out community health centers, local support groups, or hotlines could offer immediate support and guidance.
Remember, it’s okay to take your time in finding the right fit. Building a therapeutic relationship takes time and trust. It’s important to feel comfortable and understood by the professional you choose. Your well-being is a priority, and taking care of yourself is a courageous and vital step toward healing.

Here are some recommendation for private practice:
2. Talk your heart out (Find Therapists in Singapore | Best Therapy in Singapore )
- Mostly counsellors though they’ve a few psychologists
- You are able to view the therapist’s profile (what approach they ultilised eg. cbt, dbt, sfbt etc, the issues they are able to help in eg. depression, anxiety, personality disorder etc, mode of therapy ie. f2f, online, walk and talk etc)
3. A space between (Private Counselling & Life Coaches In SG | Find A Therapist)
- Psychologist, therapists, coaches
- Again able to view therapist’s profile
4. Annabelle Psychology (Clinical Psychology Clinic - 新加坡临床心理诊所 - Novena Singapore - Annabelle Psychology | Singapore's Leading Mental Health Practice)
- Psychologist and therapist (art therapy)
- Again able to view therapist’s profile

I was never officially diagnosed because I’ve been seeing a counselor instead of a psychiatrist, but more or less it seems like anxiety.
Every morning I would wake up with my heart racing and sometimes shortness of breath that requires a while and a lot of talking with my parents to calm. It’s been like that for so long, it feels like my morning routine. In addition, I tend to get plagued by negative thoughts and worries.
Due to circumstances that are personal to explain, some changes have been made to my life recently but I’m still going through my internship. Today, I woke up but without the shortness of breath and a slightly less severe racing heart.
This should be a good thing, right? It’s a sign that I’m not panicking in the morning like I have been everyday for the past few months. But it makes me feel so uneasy. The panicking feels normal to me, it’s my routine, something I have to do before I leave for work at this internship.
So not doing so makes me feel weird. It makes me feel… Unprepared. Different. I don’t exactly like this feeling, although I also can’t say for certain if I’ll be able to start waking up like this everyday. I might bring this up with my counselor, but this isn’t normal, is it?",,2,9140.0,,,,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and your concerns here on this platform. I hear you, and I commend you for your courage to share with us here.
Your experience with anxiety is understandably challenging, and the adjustments you’ve been facing, especially during your internship, seem to have really impacted your well-being. It’s important to acknowledge that what feels ‘normal’ for us is often what’s familiar, even if it’s discomforting. So, when your routine shifts, it can generate feelings of uncertainty or unease, even if it’s a positive change.
Sometimes, feeling less anxious in the morning might seem unfamiliar and, paradoxically, unsettling. The absence of your usual morning panic may feel strange and then it may cause you to question this change. Sometimes, the absence of familiar discomfort can feel unfamiliar and evoke a sense of being unprepared or uncertain about what lies ahead.
I agree with you that discussing this with your counselor is an excellent idea! It’s very common for people experiencing anxiety to find unfamiliar feelings or reduced symptoms discomforting. Your counselor can help you navigate and understand these changes, and they can offer strategies to cope with the discomfort of this new experience.
Remember, everyone’s journey with anxiety is unique, and reactions to changes in anxiety symptoms can vary from person to person! Feeling uneasy about feeling less anxious is a valid and real experience. Your counselor can help you unpack these feelings and support you in navigating this new phase.
Last but not least, I want to encourage you to celebrate any progress you’re making in managing your anxiety, even if it feels unfamiliar or uncomfortable at first! Embrace change, even if it feels uneasy – that’s how we grow, right?

It takes a tremendous amount of courage and self-awareness to recognize these patterns within yourself, and I commend you for that. The fact that you’re reflecting on your behaviors and their impact on others is a huge step in your personal journey.
I want to encourage you, that apologizing to those you feel you might have hurt or manipulated can be a part of the healing process! It’s a brave and responsible step to acknowledge any past actions that might have caused pain or distress to others. And it’s important to approach these apologies with sensitivity and understanding that the other individuals might need time and space to process your words.
The feelings of remorse and concern about your interactions with others, particularly in group settings, are undoubtedly distressing - and anyone in the same position would feel the same too. The fear of being seen as the ‘bad person’ can be indeed overwhelming, and I’m glad to see you taking the first step toward change, and you’re demonstrating this by seeking guidance
Perhaps the self-pity you experience might indeed be a defense mechanism, a way to shield yourself from further blame or criticism. Exploring this further, possibly with the help of a professional, could shed light on this pattern and help you find healthier coping mechanisms. One of the ways you could seek help is through any of the Family Service Centres or even through an online platform - these options have qualified professionals to help you understand the root issues clearer.

Thank you for being so courageous to share your true feelings and thoughts on this platform, I commend you for that. It’s not easy to be open and vulnerable and yet you still chose to be.
I am really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult time, and it sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of distressing thoughts and emotions right now such as restlessness, confusion, guilt, and swinging moods. I want to acknowledge that what you’re feeling is real, and you don’t have to go through it alone.
Sometimes feeling forgetful, restless, and unable to stay in the present moment can be signs of anxiety and racing thoughts. It’s common for our minds to wander, but when it becomes overwhelming, it can be distressing. It’s also common to be self-critical, but it’s important to remember that making mistakes is a part of being human (every one does!), and making mistakes doesn’t define your worth.
I can imagine how you feel about disappointing others - this fear of disappointing people can indeed be a heavy burden to carry. I would like you to know that you have inherent value, and your worth is not solely determined by others’ expectations or judgments.
Perhaps it would be good for you to try out this activity to see how you’re feeling emotionally and mentally - it would be a good place to start as the simple assessment can point you to the right direction:

I hear you, and I’m truly sorry you’re going through this. It’s really disheartening when the weight of these thoughts persists despite everything appearing fine on the outside. I can imagine how it’s like to feel like the problem rests within you, but I want to gently encourage you - that your struggles do not define your worth.
I can also empathise with you that you’ve tried talking to different professionals, and it’s understandable that the repetition of safety plans and consultations might feel discouraging when these thoughts persist.
My friend, you’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed by these persistent thoughts. I want to encourage you that healing isn’t always a linear journey, and it’s more about finding the right strategies that work for you personally. I want to acknowledge your strength in continually seeking help and being willing to fight against these thoughts, even when it feels like an exhausting battle.
I would like you to please reach out to a professional especially if you feel really exhausted and overwhelmed by these thoughts, as I want you to be safe. These are some numbers and contacts that you should keep with you all the time:
- SOS: 1-767
- SOS whatsapp
- IMH - 63892222
Last but not least, I affirm you, it’s entirely valid to yearn for a normal teenage life and to desire freedom from these thoughts. You’re 100% deserving of a life without this heavy burden. Keep in mind that progress might not always be immediately noticeable, but your efforts in reaching out and your courage to persist despite this challenging situation are commendable :')
Please do continue to engage in the resources that provide you with support and comfort, and remember that the right solution might take time to emerge. Your journey is unique, and the right path to healing will be as well.

6538,it’s my fault that our friendship is severed now,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/its-my-fault-that-our-friendship-is-severed-now/6538,Coping,---,3367,okay,User,,9170,1,"hi. i’ll be quick with this
i’ve been friends with this person (whom i will call j here) for quite a while now. at first, i was excited to be friends with j. we interacted a lot with each other in the early stages of our friendship, chatted, texted, the usual stuff you would expect from friends. later on, quite quickly i would say, we started to open up to one another. i guess you could say we were close.
nothing much happens in the first half.
for the second part, just a heads up, i blame myself entirely for the whole situation. keep that in mind. i don’t blame j for habouring certain sentiments.
slowly, i started to resent j. it came as stabs of jealousy, when i saw j have want they wanted, i got envious. to me, they were better than me. and they looked down on themselves. i resented them even more. they had the things that i longed for. but i disagree with that notion now. they have told me they were struggling with their mental health, and i simply couldn’t apportion blame. i still felt that way, which made me feel bad.
of course, as time passed, i resented them more. i couldn’t bring myself to talk about what they liked. at the same time, they also slowly lost enthusiasm for the friendship too. i’ve noticed that we wouldn’t talk about the intimate stuff close to our hearts anymore. now, it’s just shallow, superficial interaction. it felt weird.
i guess this resentment also made me notice the things that i disliked in their personality. the small, yet so obvious pet peeves came into view. i shouldn’t be resenting them, i told myself. but the feeling kept growing.
i didn’t notice it at first, but i guess i stopped caring about mantaining the friendship. i didn’t bother to show any interest in whatever they liked. whenever i sent a monosyllabic message, i felt guilty. they also gradually stopped caring.
now, upon knowing that they felt exhuasted with the friendship, i have no idea anymore.
i’ve been on pinterest as of late. i feel guilty for not allowing them to talk freely about they things they enjoy. and by ending the friendship, suppose if they actually cherished the friendship, then i would be doing a huge disservice to them. i was single-handedly ruining their mental wellbeing. i really don’t want that.
at the same time, i still don’t want to out my heart and soul into mantaining this friendship. it’s exhausting, as they put it.
so yeah.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us about your feelings on this platform, it takes a lot of courage to be so authentic and I commend you for that. It sounds like you’re going through a difficult time in your friendship with J, and you’ve been carrying a huge amount of emotional weight. It’s a real challenge when jealousy and feelings of inadequacy start to affect our relationships, and I can see that you’re concerned about the well-being of your friend, J.
Sometimes, when the dynamics of our friendships evolve, the deeper connections may fade into more superficial interactions - and this can be disheartening. It seems like this shift has taken a toll on both sides, leading to a feeling of exhaustion and perhaps a mutual withdrawal from the relationship.
I can imagine how difficult it is for you; the conflict between not wanting to hurt your friend and also feeling unable to invest as much in the friendship is a tough place to be in. I want to affirm you, that it’s actually a very normal thing to feel conflicted about this, especially when trying to balance your own well-being with that of a friend.
Perhaps you could take time to reflect on your feelings and the reasons behind the strain in your friendship? I can tell that you care deeply about J’s well-being and want to avoid causing any harm, and at the same time it’s important to acknowledge your own emotional boundaries and limitations as well.
Perhaps you can consider discussing these feelings and concerns further together. Is there a way to communicate with J about your thoughts and feelings? It could provide an opportunity for open dialogue and perhaps mutual understanding, even if the outcome might involve adjusting the nature of the friendship. You could try out this tool (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg ) as I can imagine how difficult the conversation might be.
Again, I encourage you, it’s not solely your responsibility to maintain a friendship, and it’s okay to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. It might be helpful to seek support or guidance from someone you trust, whether a friend, family member, or even a mental health professional, as navigating complex emotions and relationships can be challenging.
You can also try speaking to a mental health professional online if you’re more comfortable, and these are good options to begin with:
Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
Ultimately, I feel that it is important to find a balance that respects both your feelings and your friend’s, while also taking care of your own emotional needs. It’s okay to prioritize your mental health and well-being while also considering the best way to manage the situation empathetically.

Thank you for sharing with us your thoughts and feelings. I can understand how hurtful and difficult it must be to feel ignored and disconnected from your family, especially when it’s related to feelings of not meeting certain expectations. I empathise with you; feeling sad and lonely in this situation is completely valid. It’s also tough when you’re with friends and find it hard to engage fully in their conversations, leading to feelings of inferiority.
Your tendency to stay home and seek solace in sleep during the day is a way of coping with these low moods, particularly considering your early waking schedule. I want to validate these feelings and acknowledge the difficulty you’re experiencing.
I would like us to process this together, please take some time to share with us:
- Have you found any specific reasons or events that might have led to this distance with your family?
- How would you prefer to feel more connected with them and your friends?
In the meantime, here are three strategies that might help:
2. Communication: I encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with your family about how you’re feeling. When you can express your emotions and concerns, it can sometimes help bridge that gap. If you find it difficult to have an open conversation with them, try out this tool: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Seeking Support: Is there someone outside of your family and friends, perhaps a counselor or a support group, who you’d feel comfortable talking to? Sometimes an impartial perspective can provide a fresh outlook and support. It would be good if you can also speak to a mental health professional who can help you process your emotions in this situation. There are some online options which might be helpful for you too:

I’m truly sorry to hear that you feel unsupported by your wife and children, especially when you’re still grappling with such deep and profound emotions. It makes sense that you feel isolated and unheard, which leads to your distress.
I’m glad that you have at least kept trying to discuss your feelings with them, and despite their reactions, I wonder if there may be reasons for their actions too. It might be possible that they do not know how to respond appropriately or to support you, or they might also be dealing with their own challenges.
Even though it’s tough, I encourage you to seek support from others who can understand and provide the help you need. You could try reaching out to friends, a support group, a therapist, or a counselor. Speaking with a professional can offer a safe space for you to express and process your emotions without fear of judgment.
Your feelings are important and I encourage you to process them in a healthy way, and to take care of your mental health and well-being even if it means seeking support beyond your immediate family.

First of all, congratulations And thank you for sharing with us here on this platform.
I want to affirm you that it’s completely understandable to feel a whirlwind of emotions upon discovering such life-altering news. Your mixed feelings of joy, relief, and simultaneous sense of loss are very common for some women in this situation. The arrival of a child often brings a complex blend of emotions, including a profound shift in various aspects of life
The conflicts you’re experiencing—between the happiness and the worries about the changes that are approaching—are 100% valid and entirely natural! Your concerns about a potential loss of identity, freedom, and the adjustments to your relationship with your partner reflect the many adjustments and adaptations that come with this transformative journey as a parent.
I want to encourage you that this is really a very normal process, to have these complex feelings about the pregnancy. Please take your time to go through these feelings, and remember: there’s also the hormonal factor - which can really intensify your feelings on some days too.
In terms of advice, I encourage you to maintain open communication with your partner. When you can share these feelings and concerns with each other, it can help strengthen your bond and prepare both of you for the changes ahead as new parents. It might also be helpful to explore avenues for support, such as speaking with a counselor or joining a support group for expectant parents. These platforms can provide you with a safe space to share your concerns and connect with others who may be experiencing similar emotions.

You can also speak to a professional counsellor, who is trained in pregnancy/prenatal issues They will provide you strategies and a safe space for you to share your feelings openly, and support you through your journey.
Remember, it’s alright to feel a wide range of emotions during this time.

Thank you for sharing honestly with us on this platform; it’s truly brave of you to open up about these feelings. I want to affirm you; it’s completely normal to experience heightened emotions before or during your menstrual cycle. The fluctuation in hormones can genuinely impact your mood, making you more sensitive or prone to feeling upset. I’m glad that you have noticed these changes, and that awareness is the first step to getting better.
I want to assure you, feeling weepy or clingy doesn’t make you toxic It’s a part of being human, and being self-aware of how these emotions affect you and your relationships is incredibly insightful. It’s actually really common to question whether these feelings are solely due to hormones or if there might be an underlying issue.

I was scrolling through my phone when suddenly I felt hopeless. I felt that everyone was better off without me. My mindset was that other people would be happy if I was no longer around in this world.
I texted my best friend saying that I wanted to kill myself this time round. All this while, I kept on saying that I wanted to die but I always didn’t do it. Without me knowing, my best friend approached my Form Teacher about it.
I went to my kitchen, opened a cabinet full of knives and stared at it for a bit. I was in a dilemma. I stared at it for a bit and I remember vividly that there were so many thoughts in my mind.
Mindset A: If I attempted, people would be happy that I am no longer around. I won’t burden people. The people around me will be better off without me. I am better off dead.
Mindset B: If I attempted, would my loved ones be okay with it? What about my parents? What about my family? What about school? What about my friends? Will my best friends and teachers be happy about it when they find out that I died? What about my dreams? What about the plans that I had for myself?
I went back to my room and received a text message from my Form Teacher. I told my FT straight away that this time around, I wanted to do it. It’s always No Action, Talk Only. I wanted to change that N.A.T.O. to action. Theory–>Practical. My FT stopped me. I put away my phone and went into blank space for a while. That resulted in my form teacher spamming me with messages cause I went offline. I continued staring into blank space until my phone rang. I checked my phone and it’s a call from my teacher. My FT called me but I didn’t pick up. I just stared at my phone while waiting for the call to end. After a while, I felt bad for not picking up his call.
I appeared again. I replied to him and asked him why he called me. He replied that I wasn’t online with him. He did ask me to stay with him and be online. I told him about me going to the kitchen. He asked me what I did there and obviously, I wouldn’t want him to know what I had in mind. I told him that I did nothing and he didn’t believe me. So I had to tell him what I wanted to do in the kitchen. He told me that he wanted to check in with my father about me. He said nothing about me wanting to attempt.
Without me knowing, he told another FT of mine. I told him that I disagreed with him trying to call my father to check in about me. I made a deal with him that if I called him and told him everything, he wouldn’t call my father. But he did anyway, behind my back.
I called him and he picked up. I told him about it and he somehow hung up on me. He said that ultimately, he is always here for me. The whole episode ended at about 1.40 am and I went to sleep right after.
I woke up at 6 a.m. only to be awakened by my father. He asked me what happened and I was confused. He showed me his phone with my female form teacher that she had called my father 18 times. Then, I felt betrayed by my FT. ‘Oh so all this while, behind my back, he was contacting my other FT about it?’ That’s when my father asked me to get ready and he brought me to IMH.
I was admitted for 2 days and 1 night. Being there is an experience. I also observed that the people there were much worse than me and I felt that I was just overreacting and exaggerating things.
Fast forward to today, and I am doing fine. I don’t have any suicidal or intrusive thoughts but I do feel down, sad, empty and numb from time to time. EOY exams are coming in about 10 more days and I’m honestly stressed about it. But looking at it from another point of view, I think that EOY is good for me now as it is distracting me and keeping me busy 24/7.
About my form teacher, he is always there for me. He gave me advice and he helped me both in terms of academics and my mental health. I also approached him for help. He also taught me how to study and gave me study tips and it really works. One thing I know for sure is that I will never forget what he did for me and honestly, I appreciate him a lot as he was really there for me. He has seen every side of me and he knows how to make me focus on reality instead of my negative thoughts.
Apart from my form teachers, I also seek help from my school counsellor and now I am seeing her every week. Honestly, the people around me are very supportive and understanding of me. They are always here to stay and help me.",,4,6954.0,,,,

That was 2021 when i was in Sec 1. I was referred to sch counselling by my ft. I was highlighted because my subject teacher found me sh-ing in her class. I couldn’t trust the teacher-counsellor i was referred to nor my ft that time after i found out that they have been communicating with my mum without me knowing. And yes, i understand sometimes if is safety then ya la need to inform but please inform me first leh…and that time my mum would always scold me when she gets contacted by my ft which led me to not wanting to go home cuz i feared my mum.
My year head noticed that i am uncomfortable with the teacher-counsellor and asked me if i would like to switch and i politely accepted her request. From then i was bouncing between my year head and the senior sch counsellor. Why? Because my year head said that the senior sch counsellor might be busy at times so my year head would check-in with me too…
2022, i was sec 2 and my plan was simple… fake it thru and one month before my birthday, i would kill myself. Things took a turn for the better. February, a new FAJSC just transferred to my sch and instead of year head and senior sch counsellor, i was assigned to that fajsc and i could slowly trust her. Although i was attacked online by this girl, there was another victim and we both became good friends afterwards and we stayed sh sober together. I even told the new fajsc my attempts and she helped me thru it…
2023, now i am sec 3 and the start was great but things slowly went downhill and i relapsed on sh My fajsc went on a pregnancy leave aft june holidays and me and my bestfriend was assigned to another fajsc.
In August, that fajsc understood my little cries for help and she found out about my next attempt plan and she contacted my mum. Next day, she informed me that a psychologist will see me and do a assessment. I got the results after September holidays and was diagnosed with Adjustment disorder with depressed moods. I was then referred to live on by touch and the psychologist from live on helps my mum better understand me too. and i am currently still fighting",,3,,,,,

Firstly, thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts with us about what you’ve been experiencing. It takes a lot of courage to be truthful about your feelings, and I commend you for that.
I can tell that you’re feeling a mix of emotions about your elder daughter’s behavior, and it’s completely okay to feel that way. Parenting can be very challenging, especially when your child’s personality feels vastly different from your own. I can also see that you deeply care for both of your children and want to ensure a harmonious family environment.
Your concerns about your elder daughter’s behavior—her negativity, lack of remorse, and difficulties in sharing—are completely valid. It’s tough when her actions affect the family’s joy and celebrations. It sounds like despite your efforts, she perceives favoritism towards her younger sister, adding to the challenges.
Your feelings of frustration and even starting to dislike her are understandable, yet it’s important to acknowledge that these feelings are a part of the struggle you’re facing, and they don’t diminish your love for her.
I would like to encourage you:
2. Learn to understand and manage your feelings while helping your daughter with her behaviour. You could ask yourself questions to reflect, such as: How do I help my daughter feel loved and cared for in her love language? What do I need to learn about her internal world? What are some of her emotional needs that we have not met?
3. It might be helpful to consider seeking support, either through family therapy or by speaking with a professional who specializes in child behavior and parenting. Such experts can offer valuable guidance on how to foster better communication, manage emotions, and build a healthier family dynamic. I would highly recommend you to reach out to a therapist to help you manage your relationship with your child.
4. Continue to have empathy, patience, and a desire to understand your daughter’s perspective - it can go a long way in establishing a deeper connection with her. I encourage you to try having open communication (through conversations ) and find shared activities or moments; these might help bridge the gap.
Last but not least, it’s a journey, and with time, effort, and support, it’s possible to strengthen the relationship and create a more positive environment for your family as a whole. You’re doing your best, and seeking professional support is the next best step for your situation.

Thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts, I really commend you for your authenticity in sharing here with us. I hear you, it takes a lot of strength to express what you’re feeling right now too.
It sounds like you’re carrying an immense weight on your shoulders, juggling a full-time job that lacks fulfillment, studying in a course that doesn’t resonate with your passions, and dealing with the profound pain of a recent heartbreak. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed when so many aspects of life seem to be pressing down on you.
The emotions you’re experiencing, the sense of not doing enough despite your efforts, and the feeling of meaninglessness are all real and valid. These feelings can sometimes cloud our perspective and make it difficult to see a clear path forward. Your struggles at work and in school, influenced by this recent heartbreak, are understandable, and it’s okay to feel this way.
To help us continue processing this, take some time to reflect on these questions:
2. What activities or hobbies brought you a sense of fulfillment or joy before these overwhelming feelings took over?
3. Have you considered reaching out to someone you trust or a professional to share your feelings and experiences, and do you think this might offer some support or guidance during this challenging time?
I want to encourage you, that even though you feel like there’s no way out of this lifestyle, it is not permanent. Your life is not set-in-stone and things can change for the better.
If you’re willing, I would really like to encourage you to try reaching out to a professional counsellor who can help you process these thoughts clearly together and also to find strategies to cope with your situation. Your stuckness can be untangled and I really hope you will seek support. You can start by reaching out to any of these online options:

Here is one short activity that you can try and practice: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg

Do try out this tool to help you practice countering negative thoughts: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Remember, it’s really alright to not have everything sorted out at this stage of your life. What you’re going through is a lot to manage. It might be helpful to consider exploring what brings you joy or a sense of purpose, even in small ways, to bring some light into this seemingly dark time. While it might feel overwhelming, sometimes taking small steps or seeking support can gradually help to ease the burden and discover new pathways to change.
Last but not least, you’re not alone in this, and there’s hope for a different, more fulfilling path ahead, even if it might not be immediately visible. Stay patient with the process, and keep going.

Thank you for sharing with us your thoughts and feelings here, it takes bravery to do so and I really commend you for your vulnerability and bravery. I can see that you’re going through a tremendously challenging time, and it takes a lot of strength to share these feelings of stress and sadness - and these feelings are 101% valid.
Sometimes, struggling with anxiety at work and feeling stressed due to mistakes can be a heavy burden to bear. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed and find it difficult to focus when anxiety and stress take over.
The fact that you’re also battling thoughts of wanting to die is deeply concerning. I want to encourage you to reach out for support/help immediately whenever you have thoughts of hurting yourself. Please save these numbers on your phone and keep them close to you, and contact them if you feel overwhelmed:
- SOS: 1-767
- SOS whatsapp: Share on WhatsApp
- -IMH - 63892222
Also, what you’re describing—feeling an extreme level of sadness, especially when alone, and finding it hard to mask these feelings in social situations—is so real and I completely empathize with you. These symptoms sound like they align with depressive experiences. Depression is more than just a passing phase; it can impact various aspects of your life, affecting your ability to function at work, in social settings, and even in your personal time.
However, we can never be too sure unless we are assessed - so I encourage you to seek professional help to get an assessment and receive the support you need. You can also try out this tool to assess your mental health: https://mindline.sg/youth/assessment
Please know that depression is a valid and treatable condition. Seeking support and guidance, whether through therapy, counseling, or speaking to a mental health professional, can be immensely helpful. These professionals can assist in providing coping strategies, understanding the underlying causes of these feelings, and supporting you in navigating through these challenging emotions. They can also help you to process your thoughts and situation, and I encourage you to speak to one. You can either look for a therapist at a nearby Family Service Centre here: https://www.msf.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/list-of-fscs-in-operation.pdf

4260,a tournament?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/a-tournament/4260,Coping,---,3367,okay,User,,5864,1,"recently, or for a few months now, i’ve struggled with getting over a tournament.
i’ve been in a sport cca, which i will call z. i have liked and enjoyed this sport, but when i was made captain before the tournament, i felt pressurized by myself and i told myself that i was not good enough, and i shouldn’t disappoint my teammates and coaches. i liked my coach, platonically, because she was funny and friendly to me.
during the training period, i started to fall into a hole of self-deprecation. i played z. sport mostly because i felt obliged to do so, and to prepare for the tournament.
fast forward to the tournament, for the first game, we won by nine points. however, the next game, the loss was by a huge margin. during that game, i felt further pressurized that i should win, or make the loss a close one, which broke me. i knew from the first goal that the opponent scored that there was no chance to win, and i lost heart to play the game. the coach was probably disappointed at me, which also tore me apart, but i didn’t know what to do.
as i was also struggling with self-worth/ self-esteem then, i impulsively sent a vent email to my coach. maybe it was a sort of excuse to wriggle out of the inability to play well during the second game.
something happened, and the vent email was leaked to the teachers that were in charge of z. sport. before the third game, one of the teachers talked to me, and i pushed her away (metaphorically and physically).
this led on to my form teachers knowing about my current situation, and my parents knowing about it too. this isn’t bad per se, but i much rather prefer it if the coach had kept the email to herself. i asked her if she had leaked the email, but she denied it.
after the tournament, the relationship with the coach had become taut and tense. i did send her a few letters, mostly to apologise for how i acted. i also clung onto the mostly bitter memories of the tournament and the times when the coach pulled me aside to ask how i was. before the tournament, i was mostly happy and callow. now, according to the teachers, i had changed. i found it very hard to move on from the tournament and kept revisiting it. z. sport also became a very touchy topic for me to explain.
i tried to be mostly happy, but i would still come back to the coach and the tournament. i refused to admit that i was the captain, because i thought didn’t deserve to be one, and wondered why the coach selected me, out of everyone else. i revisited the juniors when they had their own tournament, cried during some nights, still struggled with my self-worth, etc. i probably became a worse person after all this.
i’m trying to move on from this tournament and the email leak incident. in the past, i felt really attached to the coach, and even after all of this, i still would trust her, time and again. i do need advice to move on because i can’t do it myself.
thank you for reading, take care of yourselves.",,2,,,,,
4260,a tournament?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/a-tournament/4260,Coping,---,59,Jaws,User,,5882,2,"Thanks for sharing @okay. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed.
I think your story is very similar to mine. You’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect, and you’re beating yourself up for losing the game. It’s important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and that it’s okay to not be perfect. You’re a good player, and you should be proud of yourself for what you accomplished this season.
When I was younger, I played basketball and I was also captain of my team. Not sure how familiar you are with the game but basically my team was losing by one and I had drawn a foul at the end of the game time. So I needed to sink two free throws to win the game, one free throw to bring it to overtime.
I sank zero.
I was devastated and felt like I was the worst player on earth. Who misses two free throws in an elimination game?
It took me a many days to get over the loss. I talked to my coach and my teammates about how I was feeling. They helped me to realize that it’s okay to lose sometimes. Everyone loses at some point in their lives. The important thing is to learn from your losses and to come back stronger.
The fact that you’re feeling attached to your coach and still trusting her, even after everything that’s happened, is a good sign. It shows that you have a strong relationship with her, and that she is someone you care about and respect.
Is there any chance you can tell her how you feel? Or are there any teammates that you’re close enough with to share your feelings?
If all else fails, maybe an alternative is to let go of this incident and pick up a new hobby / cca. The ball’s in your court now to decide on your next step but please remember that you’re not alone in this, and that our community is here to help.",,2,,,,,
4260,a tournament?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/a-tournament/4260,Coping,---,194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),5907,3,"Dear @okay,
Thank you for reaching out and sharing your feelings and experiences with us. I’m hearing that you’re going through a challenging time, and I want you to know that our community is here to provide you with support and guidance as you navigate through this journey.
It sounds like the tournament has significantly impacted your emotional well-being, and I want you to know that it’s okay to feel the way you do. I imagine being put in a leadership position can feel like a huge responsibility, and the pressures of being the captain as well as the resulting self-doubt can take a toll on anyone. I’m truly sorry that you’ve been carrying these emotions, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. I also want to gently remind you that setbacks and failures are a part of life, and it’s okay to feel disappointed or upset about them.
The events that followed, including the sharing of your vent email, have understandably added another layer of complexity to your experience. It’s completely understandable that you would have preferred to handle the issue privately, and I’m here to support you through these feelings.
Your attachment to your coach is an indicator of the positive connection you had before the tournament. Such relationships can be very meaningful and impactful. While it’s natural to have strong feelings, it’s also important to navigate through them in a healthy way. Here are some suggestions that may help you cope and move forward:
2. Embrace your emotions: Allow yourself to feel and process your emotions related to the tournament and the email leak. It’s normal to experience a range of emotions, and acknowledging them can be a healthy step towards healing. This may look like - sitting with yourself and really paying attention to how you’re feeling. Ask yourself: what emotion am I experiencing? How intensely am I feeling this emotion? Writing out how you’re feeling may also be helpful in processing these emotions, especially if everything feels all too overwhelming at once. I’m attaching a picture of an emotion wheel below that you may wish to refer to as well to help you identify how you’re feeling. Acknowledging, and understanding your emotions is a fundamental first step in moving forward from everything that has transpired.


2. Practise self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel vulnerable and seek support when needed. This also includes being mindful of the way you talk to yourself. Negative self-talk can reinforce feelings of self-doubt and hinder your progress. Practice self-compassion and challenge negative thoughts by replacing them with positive and realistic affirmations. This can be challenging to do on your own, so I’m linking a guided thought reframing exercise here you could try for a start. Examples of negative self-talk include “I’m worthless”, “I can’t do anything right”, “I’m not good enough for anything”.
3. Set realistic expectations: This ties in with the above – I’m hearing that you’ve placed an immense amount of pressure on yourself after being made captain, exacerbated by your struggles with self-doubt. While it’s truly admirable that you’ve dedicated so much of yourself to the team and upheld high standards for yourself, I’d like to remind you that nobody is perfect, and that the pressure you’ve placed on yourself as the captain doesn’t define your worth. It’s completely understandable to be feeling discouraged and upset with yourself after a loss, but shifting the perspective and looking at the loss as an opportunity to learn will go a long way in ultimately helping you pick yourself up.
4. Communicate your feelings: You mentioned having sent a few letters to your coach as an apology – how did that go? If you’re comfortable, consider having an open conversation with your coach. Sharing your emotions and attachment can lead to a deeper understanding between both of you. If you don’t feel comfortable enough to have this conversation with your coach, or perhaps not at this juncture, you may also consider writing a letter to your coach expressing your thoughts and feelings. This can be a therapeutic exercise that allows you to release any lingering emotions and gain closure. You can choose to send the letter later on, or keep it for yourself as a personal reflection.
5. Focus on personal growth: Use this experience as an opportunity for personal growth and learning. Reflect on the lessons you’ve learned, the skills you’ve developed, and the strengths you possess. Set new realistic goals for yourself and focus on building your self-esteem and self-worth.
Remember, healing takes time, and it’s okay to seek support from others. If you find it challenging to move on, consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.
Your willingness to seek guidance is a sign of your strength and commitment to your well-being. If you ever need to talk or explore these emotions further, know that our community is here for you. Take care of yourself, and remember that you are not alone in this journey.", https://global.discourse-cdn.com/youthmindline/original/1X/dc045867b230b41aae249fba51d420f05752f7b8.jpeg; here 2 http://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=find_perspective; writing a letter https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=find_closure,3,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with us on this platform - it takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable with us and I commend you for your courage.
It sounds like you’ve been through a challenging time, and it’s completely understandable to feel the weight of these past experiences. The feelings of inadequacy, doubt, and a sense of being left behind are entirely valid. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these struggles, and I completely empathize with you.
Firstly, I encourage you to recognize that your past doesn’t define your future. The fact that you’re considering returning to school is a huge and positive step! Remember, your age is not a barrier to education - many people actually do return to school later in life, and each individual’s journey is unique.
Sharing with you some examples to encourage you:

Even past his retirement age, Dr Aw Yong Keong Poh, 72, still felt there was room for improvement and time to upskill himself. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physician graduated from the Singapore University of Social Sciences with a...
My friend, your worth is not determined by comparing yourself to others. You have your own strengths, capabilities, and a path that’s solely yours. As you think about returning to education, consider it as an opportunity to build upon your skills, knowledge, and most importantly, your self-confidence.
Additionally, reflecting on your interests and passions could help shape your educational and career path. Sometimes, what you’re truly passionate about can guide you in the right direction - and honestly, most of us only find out what we’re truly passionate about at a later stage of life (like yours truly here!)
I would also encourage you to speak to a mental health professional as it might be beneficial to speak with a counselor or an academic advisor at the school you’re considering. They can provide guidance, support, and information about available resources that might assist you in making this transition. I understand it can be a little intimidating to “suddenly” seek support face-to-face, so I’m linking a few online options for you to try:

6401,Feeling Unsafe,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/feeling-unsafe/6401,Is This Normal?,---,5251,msixism,User,,8972,1,"20s/Female here
Generally, I am an anxious, worry and easily stress person. I have become protective of myself.
My role in my family is more protector, middle person. I feel anxious most of the time even since I was as young as 4 years old, I have witnessed many quarrels, conflicts, silence treatment & occasional violent incidents (throwing of furnitures) between my parents. Around my teenager age, the frequency increased 1-3 times a day and hasn’t improve. Even till today, i have always been listening out and sieving out for noise at home. I was always cautious and want to defuse the situation. Aware of violence tendency, I be there to defend or protect.
I didn’t feel safe at school either when I was young. I people please, want people (students and teachers) to like me. Was bullied/outcasted in my teens.
In personal relationships with friends & work, i noticed I have no longer able to say feel safe with any relationship … actions include: deleting my messages after sending, hiding my true self (ie hobbies, ambition), trying to align my values with my friends, needing reassurance consistently, sometimes giving silent treatment/ shutting down when I feel unsafe.
E.g even being close friends for long time (I.e 5 years or more), I still observe every reaction and over analyse it on and off line. I have also realised that the state of over-worrying/anxious, lead me unable to enjoy/cherish the moment & bond I had with my friends.
I have always assumed my state of mind as slightly anxious, and since I don’t have panic attacks, I assume seeking help wasn’t necessary. My main question is whether is it normal, and should I speak to a therapist/counseller. I hope to be able to talk to others without having to over think, over analyse, looking out for threats/weak points.",,2,,,,,
6401,Feeling Unsafe,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/feeling-unsafe/6401,Is This Normal?,---,3690,cottonsoul,Professional,Professional,8981,2,"Hi @msixism
I want to begin by saying that it takes a lot of courage to express your experiences and feelings. Your upbringing, witnessing conflicts between your parents and enduring a lack of safety both at home and at school have deeply impacted your sense of security and relationships - and it’s completely understandable to feel anxious and panicky.
Feeling anxious, constantly on guard, and having a strong need to protect yourself are common responses to the environment you’ve been in. So it makes sense that these feelings can affect how you interact and form connections with others, leading to behaviors like overanalyzing interactions, people-pleasing tendencies, and feeling unsafe in relationships.
The experiences you’ve described and the ongoing impact on your well-being are common. I encourage you to seek help - seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor could actually be beneficial for you. While you might not experience panic attacks, the persistent feeling of anxiety, worry, and the impact it has on your daily life is worthy of attention.
Sometimes, talking to a therapist can provide you with tools to better understand your reactions, manage your anxiety, and develop healthier coping mechanisms. I highly encourage you to seek help because these issues are clearly impacting your life, and therapy could help you navigate your thoughts and feelings in a way that allows you to experience moments without constant overthinking or fear. Therapists or counselors can provide a safe space for you to express yourself freely, without judgment. They can help you work through these patterns of behavior and help you learn how to build safer, healthier relationships.
There are many agencies, community places and hospitals that provide counselling and therapy services, and I highly recommend you to reach out to any of these places to talk to someone. Or, you could also start by speaking to a mental health professional online, which might be less intimidating for some people. Here are some options:

I just wanted to share that you don’t necessarily have to be struggling with panic attack/ severely before you seek help, therapy can be seen as a preventive step to prevent an issue from escalating futher into something even more servere.
For example, you might be feeling stress from an upcoming assignment/ exam and you need some tips to cope with the stress, you can turn to a counsellor and he/ she will be able to provide tools and tips on how to cope so that your stress doesn’t turn into distress.
Likewise for your case, I would highly encourage you to seek help too to cope with your anxious feelings and even help with your other issues so that it doesn’t escalate further into something serious and it (further) affects your ability to function.
Let us know if you decided to give therapy a shot and how it has been for you. Looking forward to hearing from you again, take care!", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/feeling-unsafe/6401/1,2,,8972,,8972.0,8972

Firstly, thank you so much for sharing with us your thoughts and feelings - it takes so much courage to be open here with us and I commend you for that. I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re going through such a difficult time. It’s truly very challenging when these overwhelming feelings seem to surface unexpectedly, especially when they affect your sense of self-worth and daily life.
Sometimes, bottling up emotions can lead to a build-up that seems to come crashing down without warning. I think it’s great that you’re recognizing this pattern and trying to make sense of what might be causing these intense emotions.
The pressure from graded projects can weigh heavily on your shoulders and impact your self-esteem. I can imagine feeling this sense of ugliness and the inability to look at yourself in the mirror is a very distressing experience. Your efforts to take care of yourself with regular skincare and exercise show immense strength and resilience, even when it’s really difficult to maintain motivation during such a tough period.
I can sense that the emotions you feel can be such a struggle, especially when every little thing seems to push you closer to tears. It’s okay to acknowledge that your coping mechanisms, like skincare and exercise, are important, even if it’s a struggle to keep up with them right now. If you feel ready, I encourage you to try deep breathing or positive self-talk which can help you to cope with the overwhelming moments too.
I would like to encourage you to consider seeking support. Sometimes, speaking to a counselor or therapist can offer a safe space to unpack these feelings and help develop strategies to navigate this difficult time. Additionally, confiding in a trusted friend or family member about what you’re going through could also provide some relief.
To kick start the process, you can try out either of these online options which will be helpful for you to discuss your feelings:

Would it help if you start small to release your emotion, maybe getting a journal? Talking to someone can seem like a huge jump/ step so you can start small by writing down your feelings in a journal in hopes this will help release your bottled up feelings.

Thank you for sharing your authentic feelings about your break up, and I’m truly sorry to hear about what you’re going through. Experiencing the end of a relationship that felt so profound, especially when it was the first time you truly felt deeply loved, can be incredibly overwhelming and disorienting. It’s completely natural to feel a whirlwind of emotions right now.
The attachment you developed and the emotional investment in the relationship are very valid. Sometimes, when we care deeply for someone and invest a lot of ourselves in the relationship, it can inadvertently create pressure on the other person. The desire to connect and show care can be intense and genuine, but when it becomes overwhelming for the other person, it can put a strain on the relationship.
The reason for the breakup, based on his feelings of being overwhelmed, doesn’t invalidate the love or the depth of emotions you both shared. Relationships can be complex and sometimes despite the love, the timing or dynamics may not align in a way that sustains the connection.
Feeling a mix of emotions right now, including hurt, confusion, and the sudden loss of something so dear, is completely understandable. It’s okay to grieve the loss of what was meaningful to you. I want to encourage you to take your time to heal through this process - and do be compassionate to yourself by allowing yourself to express your feelings whenever you can. You can try expressing your feelings through drawing, journaling, exercising, or even talking to a friend about them.
Recognizing that you’re spiraling and acknowledging the need for help is a powerful step. I encourage you to consider seeking support, whether through talking to a trusted friend or family member, or seeking guidance from a counselor or therapist. Having someone to talk to can help sort through the multitude of emotions and provide perspective and support during this challenging time.

It’s great that you’re exploring and seeking to understand your experiences better! It’s normal to feel like this can be confusing and even a bit overwhelming when you encounter terms like “autism” or “Asperger’s” and start recognizing similarities in your own behaviors or experiences.
The funny thing is, it’s actually very common for friends or family members to observe certain behaviors and, with the best intentions, suggest or inquire about conditions like autism or Asperger’s. Some of the behaviors you mentioned—like spacing out, fidgeting, feeling uncomfortable in crowded places, being straightforward in communication, or having trouble understanding body language—are indeed associated with traits found in autism or Asperger’s.
However, it’s very important to recognize that these behaviors alone don’t necessarily indicate a diagnosis. Many people exhibit these traits without having autism or Asperger’s. Each person is unique, and these characteristics can vary widely among individuals.
If you’re feeling unsure or if these behaviors are affecting your daily life or causing distress, it might be helpful to consider seeking professional guidance. Consulting with a mental health professional or a specialist in neurodevelopmental conditions can provide you with clarity. They can evaluate your experiences and behaviors more comprehensively to determine whether these align with any particular condition too.
Remember, understanding more about yourself and seeking guidance doesn’t necessarily mean that something is ‘wrong’ with you. It’s about gaining a deeper understanding of your unique characteristics and how to navigate the world in a way that’s most comfortable and fulfilling for you
If you decide to seek an evaluation, it might offer insight and strategies that can help you better understand yourself and manage any challenges you might face. Whatever you choose, your experiences and feelings are valid, and taking steps to explore them is a positive move toward better understanding yourself.

I want to thank you for being so open with us about your struggles, because it takes so much courage to be so vulnerable here - and I commend you for that. I can imagine how incredibly tough it is to navigate a family dynamic that feels suffocating and controlling, especially when the source of that control comes from older family members. The impact it has on everyone’s sense of freedom and individuality is understandably distressing - so it makes sense to feel disturbed by this, feeling as though you’re not living the life you wish to, especially due to this influence, I can imagine it would create a huge emotional burden.
The desire to leave home and gain independence is a natural response when the environment feels constraining, and I understand that financial dependence can become a barrier to taking that step. I hear that you wish to create a different, more liberated environment for yourself and your children, but the circumstances make it challenging to do so.
Your feelings are valid, and I encourage you to recognize the stress and conflict arising from these family dynamics. It’s important to take care of yourself, even in situations where the ability to change the circumstances immediately might not be feasible.
Perhaps exploring potential ways to set boundaries or seek support, even within these constraints, can be a helpful first step. Is there anyone outside the family whom you trust and could confide in? Sometimes, external support from friends, community resources, or counseling services can offer guidance on managing these difficult family situations.
I encourage you to reach out for support from a mental health professional, to discuss specific strategies to help you manage your situation. Here are some online options that might be helpful for you:
2. Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless

5. ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
While it might feel overwhelming right now, perhaps acknowledging your feelings and seeking ways to maintain your well-being and that of your children, within the current limitations, is a courageous and foundational step.
I want to affirm you - that you’re not alone in this, and there might be strategies or resources that could help alleviate some of the distress caused by the family dynamics. If you’re comfortable, please consider exploring further options or discussing how to cope with these circumstances with a friend or a mental health professional.

Firstly, thank you for sharing your vulnerability with us. It truly takes a lot of courage to be authentic about feelings, and I commend you for that.
I hear you, and I can see that you’re going through an incredibly challenging time. Feeling like every day is blending into the next, with no sense of purpose or belonging, is a heavy burden to carry. It’s incredibly brave of you to share these feelings, especially when you’ve faced challenges opening up to those close to you.
The struggle to find someone who truly listens and understands can be very disheartening. It’s difficult when the people we hope will support us, like family, seem unavailable or caught up in their own concerns. It’s tough to wear different masks for different situations, especially when it feels necessary even at home, where we hope to find comfort and understanding.
I understand that you’ve been grappling with these feelings for a while, searching for answers both within yourself and through external resources. The emotional exhaustion from attempting to comprehend your feelings and finding no solutions can be truly draining - and it makes sense to feel this way.
I want you to focus on being kind to yourself and offer yourself compassion. The idea of starting over in a different life might offer a sense of escape from the current challenges, but I want to reassure you that your life is meaningful and valuable, even if it might not feel that way right now. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed and lost, and it’s incredibly important to acknowledge that seeking help or support is a courageous step.
I can see that you’re really struggling emotionally, and have thoughts of hurting yourself. I want to encourage you to reach out to crisis hotlines if you feel overwhelmed or are in immediate danger:
- SOS: 1-767
- SOS whatsapp: Share on WhatsApp
- -IMH - 63892222
I also noted that you mentioned financial constraints hindering your ability to access counseling. There are resources available, even on a limited budget. Many community centers, universities, or online platforms offer low-cost or even free counseling services. Additionally, there might be helplines or support groups that can offer guidance and a listening ear without financial obligations.

You are so brave, and I commend you for this. Secondly, it does sound like you’re having a hard time struggling with how you feel and managing the relationship with your girlfriend. I’m so sorry to hear that it’s been difficult faking things and missing her at the same time, and that you miss her all the time. That can happen when we really want our partner to be close to us all the time.
I’m proud of you for recognising that you may have an anxious attachment style and that you’re aware of the impact it’s having on your relationship. Sometimes, anxious attachment can create challenges in relationships, but with self-awareness and effort, you can work on developing a more secure attachment style and develop healthier relationship dynamics.
For the time being, you might want to try these to help you manage your relationship in a healthier way:
2. Try communicating with your girlfriend in open and honest way, and share with her your anxious thoughts in a calm manner. It’ll be good for you to help her understand from your perspective how you truly feel, and let her know that you’re trying your best to work on this.
3. Practice self-soothing techniques - Try to engage in activities or relaxing techniques that help you to relax and stay calm while you’re apart. It could be simple things such as taking a walk, or drawing, or even going to play a game of basketball by yourself. Find something that helps you to keep your mind off worrying, and focus on yourself (e.g. how many hoops can you shoot in 1 min? )
4. Journaling will be helpful for you to share your feelings and thoughts whenever you feel anxious about her or the relationship. It will be good to have a safe space for you to express everything out, so that you don’t feel so “stuck”.
Bonus tip: Reach out to a mental health professional such as a counsellor! It will be good for you to speak to someone who can help you to build your confidence and practice healthier relationship habits to help you and her enjoy the relationship! Perhaps both of you can also go for therapy together to help you both work on the communication and tensions too! After all, a couple that goes through difficulties together, stay together!
Most importantly, please be encouraged and remember that you’re not alone in experiencing attachment-related challenges in your relationship (many people do actually!), and seeking support and help is a positive step toward personal growth and improving your relationship.
Hope this helps!",,3,,,,,

Thanks for sharing more about your relationship here. I definitely relate with some of the struggles that you have. In my previous relationships, I have been in those spirals where I struggle to understand why my partner did not prioritise spending time with me.
While it is sweet that you want to be as close and spend as much time as possible with your girlfriend, I’m glad you realised that it might be an unrealistic expectation. I’m curious if you have tried to ponder more on this? What then is a realistic expectation, that can help you feel more at ease? Perhaps it would then be easier for your girlfriend to work on a compromise when you two discuss the issue.
Also, I’m wondering if you have taken the time to understand what your girlfriend does in the time that she’s away from you. Perhaps it would be easier for you to understand why she needs the time away and to support the cause that she believes in. Similarly, it might also be worth exploring a cause that you want to contribute to and something you can do in your free time. That way, you would not be spending the time away waiting for your girlfriend to text back.
Another suggestion that I have is to try to get to know each others’ circle of friends. This would allow opportunity for group hangouts and be close to your girlfriend’s support system.
Lastly, I just want to say that I’m proud of you for taking the time to reflect and recognise some of your behaviours that might be unhealthy. Awareness is the first step and you’re definitely on the right track to being a better partner!",,3,,6704,,6704.0,

First of all, I want to affirm your efforts for sharing with us on this platform - it certainly takes alot of courage to be so open about your feelings and thoughts.
I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a tough time right now and it sounds like you had a very overwhelming day during your internship, and it’s completely understandable to feel anxious and upset about it. Sometimes starting a new thing (in your case it’s the internship) can be a challenging experience, and it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed at times.
It’s great to hear that your significant other was there to support you and help you feel better earlier in the day. Their belief in your abilities is valuable, and their comfort can be a source of strength for you. It’s also okay to have mixed feelings about your internship after your first day, as it can take some time to adjust to a new environment and responsibilities.
I would like to affirm all your feelings of anxiety, nervousness, stress and confusion after your first day of work - it must be really overwhelming to the point that you feel like giving up and not returning to the workplace.
I would like to help you to process your thoughts a little about the internship experience. If you’re feeling lost and anxious, it might be helpful to take some time to reflect:
2. What specifically is causing you distress in your current workspace?
3. Is it the work itself, the environment, the people, or a combination of factors?
Understanding the root of your discomfort can help you make a more informed decision about whether to continue with the internship or explore other options.
Additionally, do consider talking to someone at your internship, such as a supervisor or mentor, about your feelings. Sometimes they may be able to provide guidance, support, or even make accommodations to help you feel more comfortable in your role. They could also share more details or help you with your role, so that you don’t feel lost. You could also approach someone who sits near you and (maybe) engage in a short conversation, and start to make friends with people so that during lunch/break time you can take a breather and have your mind off the workload for a while.

I would also like to encourage you, that it’s okay to seek professional help if you continue to struggle with anxiety and overwhelming emotions. A therapist or counselor can provide you with strategies to cope with stress and make decisions about your career path and help you to manage the feelings of anxiety as well.
Take some deep breaths, and try to focus on what’s best for your mental and emotional health It’s okay to ask for help and take the time you need to make the right decision for yourself.

Thanks for sharing the struggles on your internship. It sounds like you had a rough first day at work and were feeling overwhelmed. I hope you know that it is ok to feel the way you did. You were outside of your comfort zone and perhaps that was causing you to feel anxious. If you don’t mind sharing more, I am curious what was the trigger that caused you to feel overwhelmed. Because you shared that it was all going great initially.
Personally, I have a lower stress tolerance and I also feel overwhelmed often at work. But what I find helpful is to note down the difficult task in my to-do list and first work on the other easier tasks. Sometimes, the difficult task does not seem so challenging after giving myself the space to process what’s required and checking in with my boss if the output expected is aligned. There were instances when the tasks seemed more complicated in my head, than what my boss actually expects me to deliver.
Like what @cottonsoul suggested, I recommend talking to the colleagues in your team or your mentor for guidance. It is normal for an intern to ask for help and I hope that you can give yourself time to adjust to your internship environment.
Also I’m glad that you had your significant other to lean on for support and it is heartening to hear how much they believe in you! I hope you would let that spur you to face the challenges one step at a time!",,2,,7179,,7179.0,

I’ve been confiding in my close friends and they’ve been encouraging me to talk to a professional. But is that actually going to help me? what if my parents think im weak?

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings here on this platform. I want you to know that reaching out for help is a brave and important step, and it’s a sign of strength, not weakness. I’m truly sorry to hear that you’ve been struggling with your mental health, but you don’t have to go through this alone.
I want to affirm you that your concerns about troubling your parents or becoming a burden on your friends and family are valid and real, but it’s crucial to remember that they care about your well-being. They want to see you happy and healthy, and they would likely prefer that you seek help if you’re going through a difficult time.
I want to affirm you also, that it is completely okay to cry when you feel overwhelmed. Crying is a way for us to express our emotions, and it signals to us that our emotional wellbeing is in distress. I encourage you to find ways to address these feelings rather than trying to keep them to yourself and handle them on your own. You don’t need to continue feeling this way, and I encourage you to seek professional help.
When you speak to a mental health professional, it can be incredibly beneficial as they are trained to provide support, guidance, and tools to help you manage your mental health. They can also offer coping strategies for dealing with stress, anxiety, and any other challenges you’re facing. Most importantly, they provide a safe and confidential space for you to express your thoughts and feelings without judgment. The therapist will also be able to help you develop effective strategies to manage your exam and responsibility stressors.
If you do decide to talk to a mental health professional, you can also discuss your concerns about your parents’ reactions with them, and the great thing is that they can provide guidance on how to approach this conversation with your parents in a way that helps them understand your needs and concerns too.
Last but not least, I would like to share a few options for you if you’re still not ready to seek professional help face to face. You can also try these online counselling services which may be helpful as a start:

Thank you for taking the first step to share about your mental health struggles with us here. I relate with what you said about your stressors and how it may seem like normal teenage struggles, when you look at them individually. However, collectively, I can see how the impact of exams, responsibilities and friendship compounds and it can definitely be too much for someone to handle. So, I hope you know that you’re not weak for saying that you can’t handle it anymore. You have tried to do so in the past few months and I hope you’ll give yourself some credit for surviving thus far.
The choice to seek professional help is a personal one and I understand your hesitation to do so. However, another way to look at it is that you’re exploring different solutions which you have not tried before! You’re right to say that there is a chance that it might not help. Nevertheless, you might still come out of the experience knowing yourself a little better, even if it’s through finding out what doesn’t suit you.

First of all, thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with us on this platform. It takes a lot of courage to be open about your feelings, and I commend you for that.
I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re going through this challenging situation. Breakups can be tough, especially when you discover that your ex has moved on quickly. I affirm your feelings, and I want to let you know that it is normal to feel hurt and vulnerable in such circumstances, even if the relationship was relatively short.
The prospect of running into your ex at a shared religious place can undoubtedly be anxiety-inducing, hence I encourage you to prioritize your own well-being during this time.
I would like to share some strategies to help you cope with these emotions and prepare yourself mentally for the possibility of seeing your ex:
2. Acknowledge Your Feelings: This is a period of grief for you, so I encourage you to allow yourself to feel and process the emotions you’re experiencing. If you need to cry, just cry. If you need to roll around in bed and feel sad, it’s okay too. It’s okay to grieve the end of the relationship and the shock of their new involvement with someone else.
3. Practice Self-Compassion: Please do be kind and gentle with yourself. I hope you will understand that healing takes time, and it’s okay to not be completely over the breakup yet. You are doing your best
4. Set Healthy Boundaries: If seeing your ex at the religious place is causing you some distress, do consider talking to a trusted friend or family member who can accompany you and provide support. It’s also okay to establish some personal boundaries to maintain your emotional well-being.
5. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: I believe these techniques can help you to reduce anxiety. You can try deep breathing exercises, meditation, and grounding techniques as they can be particularly helpful in managing overwhelming feelings.
6. Positive Self-Talk: Try to challenge the negative thoughts and replace them with more positive and empowering ones. Please do gently remind yourself of your own worth and the potential for a better future. You can try out this activity here for a start: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
I encourage you to focus on your own healing, by continuing to engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. You can invest time in self-care, hobbies, and focus on your own personal growth.
Lastly, If your feelings become too overwhelming or persistent, consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can provide you with specific coping strategies and emotional support. The professional will be able to journey with you through this season of your life and help you cope better.
I want you to know that it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed, and it’s okay to seek help when you need it. Do let us know how you’re doing and coping, and keep us updated on your situation.

Thanks for sharing how you’re feeling at the moment about your breakup. It must have felt terrible when you learned that your ex has moved on so soon. I relate with what you shared and I want to affirm you that it is normal to feel vulnerable upon hearing this news. I understand why you’re worried about how you will react if you were to bump into your ex. It was difficult enough to imagine your ex with someone new, let alone experiencing it in real life.
Nevertheless, I am happy to hear that you’re already thinking of ways to prepare yourself emotionally for it. It shows that you’re committed to your own healing, which I find admirable.
If you don’t mind me sharing from my personal experience, what I find helpful is the imagery of a wave. While going through a breakup, there are often moments which remind us of the past relationship, the ex and what it could have been. And in these moments it felt like I was hit by a wave of emotions. However, like the waves, these moments will pass and the intensity of the painful emotions will also subside. While we can’t avoid getting hit by the wave, what we can do is to be kind to ourselves when we’re hit by it. This may look like smiling through the pain while we’re outside and then going home to cry after. But that’s okay. I hope you know that you can take your leave anytime you feel overwhelmed and find a space where you can re-calibrate.
While there’s no fool-proof way of preparing yourself for the scene, I hope it helps when you remind yourself that the pain will pass, like how the wave will eventually subside. Feel free to share more of your healing journey with us here on the platform, we’ll be here to listen.",,0,,8643,,8643.0,
6106,Stressed and anxiety after moving,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/stressed-and-anxiety-after-moving/6106,Seeking Help,---,5060,submarine,User,,8634,1,"Hi everyone. This is rather trivial but I’ve been troubled by this recently. Apologies in advance for this trauma(?) dump.
I just moved with my parents to the new flat they bought. Turns out we forgot to account for how loud the noise of train tracks nearby can be. For some reason, I started having very bad buyers remorse for my parents’ purchase and started getting extremely worried and paranoid about their health. They repeated reassured me that they are alright and will adapt (since a new development nearby will block the tracks in a few years time), but I still feel constantly regretful and worried for them, to the point that they have started to get annoyed and start worrying for my worrying. They seem to be really excited about the house, but somehow I am constantly thinking that they might be just enduring it and are actually very frustrated.
At the same time, I seem to have gotten a bit too sensitive to the noise of the train. I spent an excessive amount of time obsessively reading up on how people adapt to noise, but the more I read, the more annoyed by it I become. I had a bit of trouble focusing at work as I would sometimes hear the train noise when the office is pretty quiet. I will also wake up in the morning feeling restless for the whole day.
Since I just moved in a few days ago, I hope this is just part of adapting to new environment, but I feel that how I’m reacting to this is extremely unhealthy and am wondering if I should seek help. Or are there anything I can do to make myself adapt better?",,1,,,,,

Firstly, thank you for sharing your thoughts with us on this platform. I appreciate your honesty in sharing your concerns, and there’s no need to apologize for seeking support. I can tell that you care deeply about your parents and their well-being, as well as your own adaptation to this new environment.
I can imagine how frustrating and irritated you feel with the noise and your confusion about whether your parents are truly okay with it, and I want to commend you for your thoughtfulness towards them. I hear that you’ve begun to feel anxious and restless when thinking about the noise and it’s starting to affect your daily life.
I would like you to consider these 2 questions, so that we can process this further:
- Have you experienced similar anxieties or regrets in the past when facing significant changes or decisions? Perhaps when you try understanding your patterns of reacting to change, it can provide insight into why you’re feeling this way now.
- Do you have any coping strategies or self-care routines that have helped you manage stress and anxiety in the past? When you take time to reflect on what has worked for you in the past can be a valuable resource as you adapt to your new environment.
If these feelings of anxiousness persist and impact your daily life and well-being, it might be a good idea to consider seeking professional help who can provide you with strategies and support tailored to your specific situation and help you manage your anxieties effectively.
For the time being, I would highly encourage you to:
2. Have Self-Compassion It’s so important to remember that your reactions are valid, and it’s actually very common to have mixed emotions when transitioning to a new environment. Do consider practicing self-compassion for yourself - for example, instead of judging yourself for feeling this way, try to be kind and understanding towards your own emotions. This can help reduce some of the anxiety and regret you’re experiencing. It might be helpful for you to try our activity here too: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Have open communication Open and honest communication with your parents is key to this issue. I encourage you to have a candid conversation with them about your concerns and anxieties, let them know that it’s a huge issue for you and that you’re being affected by the noise. Ask them how they genuinely feel about the new flat and their own adaptation to the noise. Their reassurance is valuable, but gaining insight into their perspective can help ease your worries. You can try out this tool to help you navigate this conversation better: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Last but not least, I encourage you to speak to a therapist to work out these anxieties and help you manage your emotions about the noise adaptation issue. It takes a lot of strength to recognise that you need support, and I commend you for that

This sounds quite stressful to live with @submarine. I hope you find a way to cope with this (with or without help from a therapist).
On the sound issue, it really reminds me of living in Punggol where you get planes flying over you all day, and sometimes at night too. I think it’s a matter of getting used to. For context, I used to live at level 2 right in front of a bus stop on the main road. People who come to my house would always be surprised at how I can live with so much noise.

And I am from SP(Singapore Polytechnic), currently a Year 1 student studying Mechanical Engineering and My Name is Koh Ze Kai. And This message that I am sharing with you is the truth that I am struggling and facing currently right now.
Like Imagine if you could talk to your Year 1 Poly self, What would you say to him? Plus, Also, What would you say to a Year 1 Poly person like me who keeps on constantly thinking about the negative things that happened to him or her in secondary school and the things that happened to him or her in secondary school that makes him or her feel very depressed, sad and cried. Because Apparently Many negative things happened to me back when I was in secondary school which caused me to feel very depressed, sad and cried and hurt my feelings too and hurt me too and like for example, my secondary school teachers scolding me very harshly for the way I talk to them like asking them about personal things and private things and also crossed the boundaries of my secondary school teachers and I still remembered I did something one time that crossed that the secondary school teachers boundaries by looking at a sheet for the teachers to sign in and sign out then when my secondary school discpline master saw this, she scolded me so fiercey that I went home and cry and I also cry throughout my whole entire school day and my secondary school teachers scolding me because at first, I thought it was okay to ask them about their own personal and private things without even knowing that I am completely in the wrong and my secondary school teachers scolding me for just being slightly late by the assigned time which is 1.30pm by 3 minutes late one time which is 1.33pm just to collect a jacket only while right actually during that time, the people will are the students who are giving out the jackets are still there and haven’t left and it is like as if like the thing hasn’t ended yet and talking to a few things that are considered inappropriate which caused people to avoid me. One of my secondary school friends whom I thought was a very good person and a consuellor blocked me on WhatsApp due to him thinking that I am very annoying and me constantly sharing about my problems which he at first wanted to listen but then after that, he didn’t and went to block me on WhatsApp and that happened around the end of my secondary school life and my graduation which is last year in 2022.
And Now In Poly, I still rethink back about The Many Negative Things/Memories that happened to me back when I was in secondary school which caused me to feel very depressed, sad, cried and made me feel very low on spirits and very low in mood and very dull and making me not wanting to enjoy Poly Life and treating Poly Life as if it is still my depressed secondary school life and also which made me very unable to concentrate and focus on my studies like my 8 modules which are considered very important in Poly and also made me very unable to concentrate and focus during lessons in Poly too. And The 8 modules are Engineering Materials 1, Digital Electronics 1, Engineering Mathematics 2, Introduction to Engineering, Computer Programming, Persuasive Communication with Data Storytelling, Problem Solving with Creative and Computational Thinking and Effective Writing for the Workplace.
And Then Right I still remembered right My secondary school teachers were like saying that They will care for me, but then One of The Friday Bible Study Group members who is a Year 3 NUS(National University OF Singapore) and His name is Ejin Low or/and Low Ejin. student studying law and One of The Friday Bible Study Group members also tried to warn and tell me that My secondary school teachers will only both care for me and care about me up till my O Levels only lor, then right after I graduate, There is a 99% chance that All of my secondary school teachers will stop caring about me completely because They are not obliged to care about me. At first, I didn’t really listen to and I was like very non-chalant about One of The Friday Bible Study Group members advice on telling me that There is a 99% chance that right after my secondary school that all of my secondary school teachers will completely stop caring about me.
And Then Right After My O Levels and My Graduation from Secondary School and Right After I received my O Levels Results, I started to realise that He was right in saying that because I still remembered right after a week I received my O Levels Results, I texted one of my secondary school teachers who said that they including him care about me about some things that looks like problems but then he blue tick me and he completely ignore and he never even bother to reply my message on the some things that looks like problems. And This is also another reason why I feel very depressed, sad, and have a very dull mood which caused me to think that Poly Life will also be the same as how my secondary school teachers treat me and how my depressed secondary school life is because I felt like I was being tricked by my secondary school teachers into thinking that they care about me which they actually didn’t and even One of The Friday Bible Study Group members tried to warn me about it and even my parents said that what my teacher did by not replying to message about that thing that looks like a problem is correct because he is no longer my teacher and my relationship with him is already completely over already. Plus somemore right my secondary school is like keep on continuously repeatedly saying over again and over again that all of their/the teachers in my secondary school will care for me and everyone and all of their students and look out for me and everyone and all of their students over again and over again and will care about me and everyone and all of their students.
But I really hope that all of you Please don’t tell this to Madam/Mdm Shwu Lan NGOH in SP(Singapore Polytechnic) because she is currently my personal tutor for This Sem 2 and She is teaching Engineering Materials 1 for This Sem 2 and I really don’t want her to know about the very long message and very lengthy message that I have written here too because I am very scared that if she knows about this very lengthy long message, she will scold me and reprimand me very badly and very fiercely which will end up causing me to feel very depressed, sad and cried and very hurt and then unable to concentrate and also unable to focus and also unable to listen and also unable to study on all of my Poly Lessons and also all of my Poly Classes too and all of my Poly work and all of my whole entire Poly Life too which will end up making me viewed my whole entire Poly Life as once again my depressed secondary school life again which means my whole entire Poly Life will still be as depressed as my whole entire secondary school life and I really don’t want my whole entire Poly Life to be like my depressed secondary school life again because I really hate it when that happens to me over again and over again and also including all of the other Poly Lecturers in SP(Singapore Polytechnic) like every single Poly Lecturers in SP(Singapore Polytechnic) and especially The Discpline Master Team in SP(Singapore Polytechnic) because I feel very scared that when The Discpline Master Team in SP(Singapore Polytechnic) were to see this very long lengthy message that I have written right here, they will immediately come and scold me very fiercely for writing this very long lengthy message. And Basically My Depressed Secondary School Life ruined my mental health and mental well-being as a person completely making me not wanting to enjoy Poly Life and making me both view and still think that Poly Life will still as My Depressed Secondary School Life over again and over again and is like still making me think My Poly Life will eventually become as depressed as my secondary school life over again and over again repeatedly continuously. And Also Please Don’t tell this very long lengthy message to people like My SP CCA Videography Club Members who are Celeste, Jacnita, Ding Heng, Zun Kai and Zun Kai is also the same secondary school as me as well too, But He is just a year older than me and My SP CCA Welfare Services Club Members who is Justin and My SP 22 years old Chrsitian Best Friend who is Garren and Garren is currently studying Year 1 in University right now, I think NUS (National University OF Singapore), My Other SP Chrsitian Friends who are Zac and Ian but Both Zac and Ian already graduated from SP last year and a few years ago. And Also Don’t tell this very long lengthy message to My 19 years old Brother, Ze Xian who is currently studying Year 3 Maritime Business in SP and about to graduate from SP very soon and Also all of the SP people and all of the SP Graduates as well too!!..",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your honest thoughts and feelings here on this platform – it really takes a lot of courage to be so vulnerable and real. I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re feeling scared, worried, and exhausted and I want to reassure you that it’s completely normal to experience burnout, especially during such a challenging time as exams. It’s evident that you’ve worked hard and achieved a lot over the past two years, and it’s okay to have moments of exhaustion and reduced motivation.
First and foremost, please know that your self-worth is not solely determined by your grades. I want to affirm you that you are a valuable and unique individual regardless of your academic performance. It’s understandable to want to meet the expectations of those around you, but it’s equally important to prioritize your own well-being too. Do remember that no matter what happens, you are more than the grade on your report card.
I would also like to share some suggestions that may help you prepare for your exams in the next few days, so here are some steps you can consider:
2. Break Tasks into Smaller Steps: Instead of trying to tackle all your subjects at once, break your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. Try to focus on one subject or topic at a time.
3. Set Realistic Goals: Don’t aim for perfection; aim for progress Set achievable goals for your study sessions, and celebrate your accomplishments along the way.

I know I can’t rely on my therapist / keep the relationship going forever but it’s something that I’ve a hard time to cope/ deal with and somehow it affects/ hinders my recovery because if there’s something “wrong” with me, there’s something to work on and I can continue to keep the relationship with my therapist.",,4,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, it takes a lot of courage to be so vulnerable and open on this platform so I commend you for that. I appreciate you sharing this complex and understandable concern about your therapeutic journey. It is actually very common to feel attached to the support and relationship with your therapist. Let’s explore this further.
Firstly, can you tell me more about the reasons you value the relationship with your therapist so much? What aspects of the relationship are particularly meaningful to you?
Secondly, it’s important to consider the balance between seeking help and your personal growth. Have you talked to your therapist about these feelings and concerns? If not, what might be holding you back from discussing this with them?
I’d like to offer a few suggestions:
1) Open Communication with Your Therapist:
Your therapist is there to support you through your entire healing process, and they understand the significance of the therapeutic relationship. I encourage you to share your concerns about your fear of getting better with your therapist, as it can be an essential part of your therapy. When you discuss these feelings with your therapist, it may help both of you understand and work through this process better.
2) Exploring the Meaning of Recovery:
Take time to consider what “recovery” means to you. It doesn’t necessarily mean the end of therapy or support. It could signify a transition to a different type of support or a more independent approach to managing your well-being. You can also process this idea of recovery with your therapist too.
3) Creating a Gradual Transition Plan:
You can work with your therapist to create a transition plan that allows for a gradual decrease in the frequency of sessions while maintaining support as needed. This can help you feel more in control of the process and reduce the fear of a sudden loss of support.
I also want to affirm you that your therapeutic journey is unique, and it’s important that you feel empowered in your recovery. I highly encourage you to bring up these issues of fear and anxiety into your therapy sessions and eventually process them together with your therapist.

Thank you for the reply and for your suggestions. Really appreciate it!
Answering your questions:
2. I feel heard and validated. I felt someone finally truly cared about me, I felt important.
- Growing up, I had a lot of people dismiss my issues, like no one paid attention to me/ I wasn’t important cause no one expected me to be struggling cause “I grew up in a good family”.
3. I just engaged a new psychologist, so far we’d 5 sessions together. I haven’t shared yet about this issue and it’s not really cause of fear but I think it because it won’t be so soon that we’ll cease the relationship hence there’s no urgency to tell her. But I guess when the right time comes, I’ll talk to her about this?
I’m not sure if I should speak to her early about this? Cause it might hinder my recovery?
I guess I’m asking also cause last time I had a counsellor (she has since resigned) but when she was still my counsellor, I was getting better and there was that fear/ I started fearing/ overthinking that if I fully get better, I won’t need her anymore and there was a period of time that I started to struggle emotionally again cause of the thoughts (I experienced low mood and it became so bad that I started to self-harm again).
I’m just worried it’ll happen with my current psychologist like I can’t cope without her and start to struggle again.",,2,,8494,,8494.0,

Thank you for responding to the questions! It takes a lot of courage to be so honest and truthful about your past, so I really want to commend you for that.
I’m proud of you for having that good sense of self-awareness, as you have described that in your past you felt that no one paid attention to you and that you weren’t important. I empathise with your feelings of insignificance, it can really be a painful emotion to deal with - and just because someone grew up in a good family doesn’t mean that they don’t have struggles. I can sense that there was likely a lot of misunderstandings as well.
I’m also happy to read that you’re working with a psychologist now, and although you don’t forsee the therapeutic relationship ending anytime soon, I think it would also be good to share this with her too - but of course at a time whenever you’re ready to. I feel that therapy is a safe space and there’s nothing too early, too scary, too painful, to embarrassing (or etc) to share - the right time is always now (when it surfaces) because if you’re going to wait until you feel the same way again, it’s probably going to intensify and get even more scarier to manage, and you might not want to even bring it up at all.
I hear your worries, I understand that you are concerned if bringing this up might rupture your relationship with your therapist or hinder your recovery process. In my opinion, I think it would be good to process this with her soon, but if you don’t feel ready to, you can wait until the time is right But, I truly believe that if your therapist is sensitive enough (to your feelings), she will be able to hold that space safely for you and she would be able to process them together (even if the relationship isn’t coming to an end yet).
It’s ultimately your decision, and no matter what you decide to do, we’re here to support you. Do share with us what your thoughts are and what your next steps are too! Happy to journey with you here.",,3,,,,,

Actually one reason why I sought therapy is cause I’ve a huge fear of people leaving/ relationships ending cause I see it as them abandoning/ not wanting me. Logically I know it’s not true but it feels very real/ true to me and it causes a lot of problems.
Actually with my current psychologist I haven’t gone in depth yet (cause I want to take it slow/ pace myself) but in our last session I did scrap the surface of talking about relationships and how it affects me but yeah, in the next few sessions, I’m probably going to go in-depth and talk about my fear(s) (fear of the end of relationships and its impacts on me).
It’s hard for me to open up but I trust and feel comfortable enough with my current psychologist to probably in my own time open up. It’s just really hard to open up and talk about relationships cause it’s very uncomfortable for me but I trust eventually I’ll/ we’ll get there",,2,,8620,,8620.0,

I’m truly sorry to hear that you’ve been experiencing daily dizziness and discomfort for the past three weeks. It sounds like a challenging and distressing situation. I’m here to help you explore and address what you’re going through.
First, have you noticed any specific patterns or triggers that might be contributing to this dizziness and gastric pain when you’re about to eat? For example, any particular types of food, certain environments, or stressful situations?
Secondly, it’s essential to consider your overall health and well-being. Have there been any recent changes in your life or significant stressors that could be related to these symptoms?
I’d like to offer a few suggestions to consider:
2. Consult a Medical Professional:
Given the persistent nature of your symptoms, it will be good to reach out to a healthcare provider who can assess your condition. They can help determine if there are any underlying medical causes contributing to your dizziness and gastric pain.
3. Keep a Symptom Journal:
It might be helpful to keep a journal of your daily experiences, noting what you eat, when your symptoms occur, and any potential triggers. This can provide valuable information for both you and your healthcare provider.
4. Practice Relaxation Techniques:
Try to incorporate relaxation techniques into your daily routine to help manage stress and potential anxiety that may be exacerbating your symptoms. Techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, and progressive muscle relaxation can be beneficial.

Thank you for sharing this with us! It’s completely understandable how our minds can create scenarios as a way of coping, especially when faced with a traumatic upbringing. Your ability to acknowledge and explore this is an important step in understanding yourself better
It’s actually quite common for people to daydream or engage in elaborate fantasies, and in moderation, it can be a healthy way to escape temporarily and even inspire your creative pursuits. However, when these fantasies start interfering with your daily life or sense of control, it’s worth processing it with someone, or a mental health professional.
I would like to ask a few questions for you to process and think about, and if you have time you can answer these:
- Can you recall any specific situations or triggers that seem to lead to these prolonged daydreams or fantasies?
- How do you feel after these episodes of daydreaming? Do they provide you with a sense of relief or serve as a distraction from certain emotions or thoughts?
It might also be good to use some helpful strategies to manage the fantasies so that you can continue with your daily functioning. Here are a couple of strategies that may help:
2. Mindfulness and grounding: Practice mindfulness exercises to become more aware of the present moment. Techniques like meditation and deep breathing can help you gain better control over your thoughts and bring your focus back to reality when needed. You can also try this activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Journaling: Consider keeping a journal where you can channel your creative thoughts and fantasies. This can provide a safe outlet for your imagination while allowing you to reflect on your feelings and experiences. It’s great that you currently write, so this journal can be a helpful outlet for you to process your thoughts and feelings at the same time
I would also like to encourage you to seek the support of a therapist or counselor, which can be immensely beneficial. They can help you further explore the relationship between your coping mechanisms and your past, and provide you with tools to create a healthier balance between fantasy and reality.
Lastly, I’m proud of your willingness to understand and address this fantasizing issue! This is truly a positive step towards self-awareness.
Let us know if you’ve tried any of the strategies and how it worked for you?

Yeah I used to practice about 5-10 mins of meditation or mindfulness but that was about 6 years ago/ Life has been going downhill generally now cause of the nature of my current job - Long hours at the night and inconsistent days of work that i have to anticipate.
I am working and contemplating on taking a course in IT - Block Chain. In hopes that i can get a more structured lifestyle. I know 9-5 is mundane to most people but i find solace in predictability. Cause i can plan out my week and make time for things like gym, my hobbies- gaming night,busking etc .
I do still do journaling but the irony of it all is that over time i have forgotten the lessons that i have learned cause of my current living state. I used to talk and ponder about deep issues like questioning our existence, how time have change for eg. i used to listen to Radio dramas and now its replaced with Podcasts - Stuff like that.
I will check out the link now and before i go…
I am seeking counselling with Club Heal and i was asked why? because i seemed mentally stable but the thing is like in the example of fantasies and internal dialog that i have ( sometime full of rage ) i guess i just wanted to learn ways to control my mindset. Cause I definitely can’t control the people or the outcome of situations but i can have a genuine positive outlook on how i look at myself and manage my mindset.

Firstly, I want to let you know that there is nothing wrong with you having to pace around while you study. There is no rule stating that you must be seated quietedly in order to study - if what you’re doing works for you, that’s great! I may be able to offer a theory as to why you do this that is separate from ADHD, and that is pacing helps to reduce distractions while your brain is trying to focus on your study material. On top of this, incorporating movement (e.g. walking, standing, pacing) with studying can be beneficial in ways like boosting memory, thinking, and executive functioning - so I’d say you’re on the right track
Next, I want to emphasize that just because you pace around, or if you have certain symptoms of ADHD you find online, it does not necessarily mean you have it. The only way to be certain of this is to get a formal evaluation by a psychologist or psychiatrist. Here is an article breaking down the symptoms of ADHD and where you can go to be evaluated for it: [The Ultimate Guide To Identifying and Treating ADHD in Singapore ]
Additonally, you could also reach out to your family doctor or a school counsellor to get a referral or advice on the next step.
Finally, I would like to let you know that if you do have ADHD, it is nothing to be ashamed of nor does it mean that there is something wrong with you! Everyone operates differently and getting a diagnosis just means having to adjust your lifestyle to what suits you. Whether that is changes in habits or taking medication, relevant help can be provided and we are always here to support you in your journey (ADHD or not )

I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through this, and I want you to know that your feelings are completely valid. It can be incredibly challenging to open up about something like this, especially when you’ve had a difficult experience in the past. I want to affirm you that you are not alone, and many people have faced similar fears and concerns.
First and foremost, I want to reassure you that ADHD is not a measure of your worth or capabilities. It’s a neurobiological condition, and it doesn’t define who you are as a person. If you suspect you have ADHD and it’s affecting your ability to focus and perform in school, it’s important to address it so you can receive the support and resources you need.
When it comes to talking to your parents, it may be helpful to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Let them know that you’re struggling, not because you want to, but because you need some help and support. You could also share your concerns about your grades and your focus in class, and express your desire to do better. It’s possible that your parents may not fully understand ADHD, so consider providing them with some information about the condition to help them gain a better understanding. If you find it uncomfortable to start the conversation, you could try out this resource that could help you to navigate the conversation: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
I want to encourage you that seeking help is a sign of strength, and it’s a step towards improving your well-being. If you’re uncomfortable discussing this with your parents alone, you might want to involve a teacher, school counselor, or another trusted adult who can assist you in the conversation too.
You deserve the opportunity to receive the support and resources that can help you thrive academically and in other areas of your life. I’m here to support you, and there are professionals and resources available that can provide guidance and assistance throughout this process
Let us know how it goes for you, and what your next step is like. I look forward to hearing from you!",Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg 3 https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=resolve_conflict,0,,7966,,7966.0,

For instance, he often quarrel and argue with my mum and this has started since young. Hence whenever they start quarrelling, I will somehow feel anxious and unsafe.

5517,Childhood trauma,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/childhood-trauma/5517,Is This Normal?,---,3690,cottonsoul,Professional,Professional,7996,2,"Hi @reyy
First of all, thank you for sharing your experiences and feelings here on this platform so authentically - it takes a lot of courage to share and I commend you for that effort. I want to express my deep empathy and understanding of the challenging and distressing environment you’ve been living in; it truly takes a lot of strength to share so openly about your family.
I can see that living in a household with ongoing conflict can be emotionally taxing, and it is completely normal to feel emotionally drained when these things happen at home. And your responses, such as feeling anxious and unsafe, are entirely understandable. I affirm your feelings, they’re real and valid - and anyone in your shoes would feel the same way too.
I was wondering, have you been able to reach out to someone you trust, like a friend or other family member (cousin, uncle, aunty, grandparents?), to discuss your feelings and experiences? Sometimes, sharing your emotions can often provide a sense of relief and support.
In this delicate and difficult situation, I would suggest these things:
2. Seek a safe space to express your emotions and thoughts. It can be helpful to speak with a therapist or counselor who can provide you with a confidential and nonjudgmental space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies. You can start by exploring the family service centres near your home and ask for help from the counsellors there - they would be able to guide you to regulate your emotions better, and keep you safe as well.
If you’re still uncomfortable, you can try these online options which also will give you access to mental health professionals:
2. Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
3. CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
4. IMH CHAT : https://www.imh.com.sg/CHAT/Pages/default.aspx
5. ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
6. Practice self-care and relaxation techniques. Try to engage yourself in activities that help you manage stress, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or engaging in hobbies, which can be beneficial in times of distress. You can try these activities for a start: Deep breathing (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg) or positive self-talk (https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=find_perspective)
It’s important to remember that you are not alone, and it’s okay to seek help and support to navigate these challenging family dynamics. You deserve to feel safe and secure. If you ever feel very unsafe at home, please have a safe space to run to (like e.g. grandmother’s home or cousin’s home or school) and these adults will also be able to lead you in the right and safest direction.
Last but not least, if you ever feel overwhelmed or are in immediate danger, please reach out to a crisis hotlines:

- SOS whatsapp: Share on WhatsApp

I appear very happy go lucky , everyone around me also get the vibe which i hope helps them. Smiling is the best get away, everyone will think you are just happy! But i seriously do not understand? Know? How i’m actually feeling, or is it a neutral emotion? Im so confused. Im always so expressive with other people, but i just have a straight face when im alone. Its so werid, the only time i know what im feeling is when the emotion is suitable in the context, e.g watching my fav yt channel : happy and excited
Watching comedy : happy

Im so confused, this is normal right?",,3,,,,,
4953,Im confused,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/im-confused/4953,Is This Normal?,---,3690,cottonsoul,Professional,Professional,7202,2,"Hi @1outof7billion !
Thank you for taking the time to share your feelings and thoughts here on this platform. I’m sorry to hear that it’s been difficult for you to reconcile the feelings of happiness like “smiling” versus the underlying emotion of feeling “neutral”. I would like to affirm you that these feelings of confusion and anxiety are completely normal - we all experience these feelings at some point of our lives.
I also would like to assure you that it is absolutely normal if you don’t get too emotional, or if you overreact about some things, and also when you remain emotionally-neutral. Sometimes when we have these ups and downs, it can appear to be exaggerated or minimalized to ourselves but it might actually be very normal responses for ourselves
For example: If I feel happy laughing about a cartoon show, it might look like an exaggeration to someone else who doesn’t find it funny - does it mean that there’s anything wrong with me or my feelings are overreacting? No, it just means that we all have different thresholds and limitations to what we find funny, sad, endearing, or what pushes our buttons, or creates an emotional response in us.
In simple terms - we are all different and we may respond to the same stimulus in different ways, and different magnitudes : and that is 101% okay
So I want to assure you that it’s completely normal to feel confused about your own reactions and feelings.
However, I do want to put a little disclaimer here:
If you ever feel like your reactions and emotional responses are way out of line:
2. As compared to what is acceptable in general, for example, ""I enjoy hurting pigeons and cats and I feel calmer after I kick/hurt them""or
3. It is disrupting your functioning, for example “I cry so much that my eyes swell and my head hurts and I can’t go to work and I can’t even shower”
Then I would suggest that you seek professional help and assistance and have a psychologist to assess for any mental health issues, as they are able to help further.
However from the sound of what you described, it does not seem to be in those 2 extreme examples that I’ve written, so you’re all good

My husband is a great individual who appreciates family time and bond with the children.
We went through ups and downs together building our home and family.
I have huge problem! Since the start of the relationship my issue would be either his parents or his impulsiveness temper.
Weighting his strength n weaknesses, he scored more on the strength and fall only about his anger management for weakness.
Each time when he is mad/upset, he will shout at me or kids even in public and using cursing words or vulgarities.
This had always been the reason for me to leave this marriage since before…
I have always calmed down and believe he will change… But slowly things building up and my tolerance for this temper is no longer valid.
I got upset even with little tiny things.
Eg: his mom had leg cramp in the car, he got anxious and he started shouting at me to lift her leg helping her to ease the pain. With him shouting at me furiously, his both parents just looked at me and said nothing. This wasn’t the only occasion where he had shouted at me.
I realised RED FLAG! even his parents not able to protect me!
I have been holding on and accepting it as a norm thing but lately I felt that it’s too much and I felt pain in my chest each time he shouted at me😞",,4,,,,,

Thank you for sharing with us how you feel, it takes so much courage to be real here on this platform and I commend you for your authenticity. I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re going through such an emotionally painful situation - it does takes a lot of strength and courage to open up about these feelings of sadness, and these unbearable experiences. I can see clearly that you deeply care about your family and have tried to make the best of your marriage for many years. It’s also clear that the anger and shouting from your husband has been a recurring issue, and it’s causing you emotional pain.
I empathise with you; I can completely understand that you’ve reached a point where you’re no longer able to tolerate the constant outbursts of anger from your husband. I want to assure you that your well-being and emotional health matters, and it’s important to prioritize your own feelings and safety.
I’d like to encourage you - that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, valued, and safe. If your husband’s anger and verbal abuse are causing you distress and impacting your emotional and physical health, it may be time to consider seeking help, whether through couples counseling or individual therapy. I think it is important to address this issue and explore whether change is possible.
If you’re not sure where to begin seeking help from, you can try one of these online counselling options which may be less intimidating for you for a start:

I get startled easily when there’s sudden sounds.
Would like to ask if this is normal or I should get it checked.
i.e. speeding motorcycle, loud bang, thunder, popping sounds
For the most part, I would jump when I hear such sounds. It doesn’t seem as much as a specific sound that I am more sensitive to but sounds that catch me offguard. It will take me a few minutes to calm myself down and bring down my breathing to a normal rate. Sometimes I lose sleep over this since my bedroom is facing the main road.
I do think that I am more sensitive to sounds more than others. For example, I do get frustrated with chewing sounds or clicking of pens to some extent.

5216,Sensitivity to sound,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/sensitivity-to-sound/5216,Is This Normal?,---,3690,cottonsoul,Professional,Professional,7581,2,"Hi @yung
Thank you for sharing your feelings with us here on this platform, I commend you for taking the courage to be authentic with us. I understand that you’ve been experiencing a heightened sensitivity to sudden sounds and that it’s causing you distress.
Your description suggests that you may have a heightened startle response, which can be due to various factors, including heightened anxiety or stress levels. It’s important to explore this further to better understand the root cause and determine the most appropriate strategies to help you manage your sensitivity to sounds.
You also mentioned that this sensitivity extends to other sounds, such as chewing or clicking of pens, which could be indicative of a condition known as misophonia. Although we are not able to diagnose on this platform or on social media, it might be useful to know what Misophonia is – it is a heightened emotional response to specific sounds, and it can also be associated with heightened sensitivity to unexpected noises.
I would recommend reaching out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychologist, who can provide you with a comprehensive assessment and work with you to develop strategies to manage your sensitivity to sounds. Therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral techniques, can be effective in helping you understand and cope with these sensitivities and they can also provide relaxation techniques and mindfulness practices can help reduce anxiety and stress, which may contribute to your heightened sensitivity to sounds.

My experiences with psychotherapy haven’t been the most pleasant, in fact it was because of these experiences that caused me to be hestitant about attending therapy and eventually I took a year long break from therapy.
In this year long break, I’ve been coping mostly alright, I still engaged with counselling and that has been rather helpful, my counsellor taught me certain skills on emotional regulation and distress tolerance.
However, I decided to restart psychotherapy because of recent turns of events and also there’s a specific issue that I would like to work on that requires a more specialised kind of help. I’m really nervous, there’s definitely a chance that this therapeutic relationship might not work out again but I’m definitely going with an open mind, It’s a leap of faith.
I guess what I’d hope to share is that don’t be discouraged or disheartened if your experiences in therapy haven’t been the most pleasant/ great. Tbh, this is my 5th psychologist that I’m engaging, I wanted to give up but I thought to myself how therapy is/ can be helpful/ beneficial and I wanted to be able to improve the quality of my life…
I hope we’ll all be able to find a therapist we can have a good rapport with and in time that therapy will be beneficial for us because I think everyone can benefit from speaking to a professional, just need to find the right fit and I’m still on my hunt of finding one so don’t give up

I think it’s generally the same for me but on top of that, I tend to look for someone who has similar life experiences (but sometimes that can be hard to find)
I’m also mindful that I often judge too quickly so if the therapist doesn’t show that they understand me in the first 5 mins, I tend to shut off already.
While I would like someone that I can relate to, sometimes I do enjoy hearing a different perspective. Basically I like someone who can tell me where I was wrong because that’s very valuable to me.

I am so glad to hear that you’ve decided to restart therapy, and I wonder how has it been for you so far? Would you be able to share with us some of the things that you have found helpful, and some things that has worked? We would all be able to learn from your experiences too.

Psychotherapy can be really helpful for us, and if we take our time to find the most suitable one for us, I’m sure we will be able to form a healthy therapeutic relationship with the therapist and continue to benefit from speaking to them.
Let us know how your search has been and how you’ve benefitted so far! I’m excited to know how the progress has been for you
Hear from you soon!",,2,,6121,,6121.0,

Thanks for checking in. Through a friend’s recommendation I managed to find a psychologist for myself. So far we’ve had 4 sessions together and I’d really liked her, I feel like we’ve a good rapport, she makes me feel safe and comfortable to share and talk with her, she also validates my experiences and feelings, she always ask more about my experiences (don’t gloss through any issues) while also creating a safe and non-judgmental space .

Firstly, thank you for sharing your honest thoughts and feelings here on this platform – it takes a lot of courage to be so vulnerable here and I’m really glad you reached out to talk about this. I want you to know that you’re not alone in experiencing social anxiety, and your feelings are completely valid. I can imagine how distressing and frustrating it can sometimes feel to have to manage the feelings of anxiety that can sometimes overwhelm you. I affirm your efforts to seek help here on this platform and I am proud of you for reaching out.
I want to encourage you that there is hope for the situation and you are not alone. I would like to share some strategies and helpful suggestions so that you can learn to cope.
For starters, I think it’s important to be kind and patient with yourself. Self-compassion is a powerful way to help you manage your anxiety. When you recognize that these feelings are valid, and you’re not a burden to your loved ones – that they care about you and want to support you, you will be able to extend patience and kindness to yourself, the same way that your family and friends are extending to you too If you don’t know where to start, you can try out our activity here on self-compassion: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Another wonderful technique you can try is mindfulness. Mindfulness involves staying in the present moment without judgment. When you’re alone and anxiety starts to creep in, focus on your breathing or the sensations in your body. Taking slow, deep breaths can reduce physical symptoms of anxiety. You can practice deep breathing here: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
I would also recommend trying gradual exposure. This means that you could start by taking small steps outside of your comfort zone and stretching your window of tolerance. For example, you could start by just stepping outside for a few minutes or taking a short walk around your neighborhood. Gradually increase the time and distance as you become more comfortable outside and keep encouraging yourself to not give up trying! With more exposure, you’ll get better at managing your feelings too.
Last but not least, I encourage you to challenge the negative thoughts that come to your mind. When you feel like everyone is judging you, try to remind yourself that actually most people are too preoccupied with their own lives to pay much attention to others. Remember that your thoughts aren’t necessarily reality You can also practice challenging your negative thoughts by countering them with positive thoughts, and one activity that you can start with is: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Again, I want to commend you for reaching out on this platform to seek support. Another way you can seek support is through therapy – you can consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in anxiety. They are mental health experts who can provide you with tools and strategies tailored to your specific needs and can support you throughout your journey.
Please remember that progress may be slow, and there will be ups and downs, but with time and effort, you can learn to manage your social anxiety and regain more confidence in yourself.

Couple of weeks back, my mood was amazing. I woke up and feel great while preparing for my day. However for the past week, my mood has been so bad.
I wake up unsure of what I am feeling, and in a few hours time, I’ll get so tired and sleepy. I don’t even have the mood to even use my phone. I just want to lie down and stare at my ceiling, and sometimes, I’ll suddenly have a sense of anxiety rushing up, and I’ll feel like crying. When night comes, it becomes worse. I’ll blank out, no energy, don’t feel like talking, and even using the phone or watching TV becomes hard for me. I just don’t feel like doing anything and I feel so lonely. In the past, I would watch TV or scroll through my phone watching Youtube or Instagram, or watch anything funny. But now, I just laugh and immediately after that, I’ll feel lonely and sad. Not only that but any loud bangs that my neighbours make upstairs make my body tensed up and I’ll get so irritated and annoyed. In the past, I could try my best to ignore it, but now, I can’t seem to do that.
I’ll be honest, I thought it has something to do with the trees being trimmed around my block. All of the trees behind my block were trimmed down so much that it feels empty. And it’s around that time when I started feeling super down and have no energy to talk to anyone. I have no clue whether that is affecting me but I can’t think of anything else.
Honestly, I feel so tired and irritated now a days. I know there are things for me to look forward to, such as I am heading for an overseas trip soon, or I will be starting my new job soon. But I can’t seem to find the energy to look forward for either and I keep thinking of negative thing. What should I do?",,1,,,,,

Firstly, thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings here on this platform; it takes alot of courage to be vulnerable here and I commend you for that. I’m really glad you reached out to talk about what you’ve been experiencing lately.
I’m really sorry that you’ve been feeling confused, anxious, and having low moods as well. It sounds like you’ve been going through a tough time, and it’s completely okay to feel the way you do.
I want to affirm your efforts - that you’ve been noticing significant changes in your mood and energy levels, you do have a good sense of self-awareness. The contrast between how you felt a few weeks ago and how you’re feeling now can be quite disorienting and distressing, I would feel the same confusion too if I were you. The fact that you’re having difficulty finding joy in activities you used to enjoy, as well as experiencing anxiety and sadness, suggests that something is indeed affecting your emotional well-being.
One of the resources you can perhaps try here, is this mental health assessment tool: Take A Free Mental Health Self-Assessment Test | mindline.sg
It’s interesting because it helps you to have an idea of what you’re experiencing and it could point you in the right direction to seek further support.
Also, your observation about the trees being trimmed near your home is interesting! Changes in your environment can sometimes have an impact on your emotional state, as they can disrupt your sense of familiarity and comfort. It’s possible that this change has played a role in how you’re feeling, but it’s also essential to consider other factors that might be contributing to your mood.
I’m wondering - did something happen recently that caused you to feel so low? Could it be something that someone said earlier? Or did something in your life change, like a routine? Were there any recent losses or friendship/family issues in the past few days? Is the new job something that is a totally new field for you?
These are some questions you can think about to find out what could have triggered these low moods. It will also be good for you to process your thoughts with someone - it could be a friend or a family member that you could try to talk to.
I also want to encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide you with the support and guidance you need. They can help you explore the underlying causes of these changes in your mood, and together, you can work on strategies to manage and alleviate your symptoms. Therapy can be a safe space for you to express your feelings and gain a better understanding of what’s going on within you.
If you feel unsure about which therapist to talk to, you can try these few online options for a start:
2. Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
3. CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
4. IMH CHAT : https://www.imh.com.sg/CHAT/Pages/default.aspx
5. ec2 : (http://ec2.sg/) : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself. It’s okay to have moments of low energy and sadness, and it’s essential not to judge yourself for feeling this way. If you need help with being compassionate with yourself, try this activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
I would also encourage you to engage in self-care activities that you find comforting and soothing. For example, do you enjoy drawing or painting? Or maybe taking a walk in the park will help to ease your senses. You can also try to practice deep breathing when you feel overwhelmed: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg

From then on, everytime I am in public I would ensure that people dont laugh at me. As funny as it sounds, I would do things, walk, or eat in a certain way just so people wouldnt laugh at me.

I can imagine how draining it can be when you’re in a toxic work environment. It does sound quite rude for your colleague to laugh in your face.
I get the feeling of wanting to fit in so that people won’t laugh at you. It must be really tiring. Walking on eggshells all the time is not sustainable. Do you have someone to confide in at your workplace? Maybe a good way to start is to hang out more with people who are more accepting of you.
How about outside of the workplace? Do you feel the same way too or is it better?",,1,,,,,

Since I am an introvert too, I guess I tend to listen more actively. I shall try to hang around and engage in more conversations with my colleagues who are nicer.
It is the same when I am in public too. I used to be carefree and not be bothered by what anyone thinks. Now I care too much what people think. Whenever I board the train, everytime when someone laughs I get so triggered if they are laughing at how I look or stand.
I have a few friends outside of work and we hang out at times when we’re free. I had a very close friend from school that I would confide my feelings and problems. We had a friendship that lasted for quite sometime even years after graduation. She would listen and give some encouragement and advice. Ive also tried to switch topics every now and then so she wouldnt be bored listening to my problems all the time. Unfortunately, that didnt last very long.

First of all, I want to commend you for your courage in sharing your feelings and thoughts on this platform. It takes a lot of bravery to be vulnerable, and I thank you for that. I also want to affirm you of your feelings; I can imagine how painful it is to hear and experience such encounters with your father.
With that, I’m truly sorry that your relationship with your family has been challenging and it has caused you to wonder about your worth, and I want you to know that I’m here to listen and support you. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of emotional pain, hurt, and confusion. I want to affirm you that these feelings are completely natural, I would feel the same too if I were in your shoes.
At this point, I understand that you feel like disappearing because of the pain you’re feeling, but I would like to offer another perspective: that your worth as a person is not determined by your father’s opinions or actions. You are valuable just as you are, and you have the potential to achieve great things in life. It might feel as though your father has a lot of power over your life and you feel like you can’t change anything, but there are actually a lot more things in your control than you believe…
For example, it’s true you can’t change your family, but - you have the power to seek support for yourself! It can be incredibly beneficial to talk to someone you trust about what you’re going through, whether it’s a close friend, a teacher, or a counsellor. When you share your feelings with someone, it can be a powerful way to relieve emotional pain and receive support.
Given the complex family dynamics you’ve described, it might also be helpful to involve a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support to you and your family – the professional can help guide you through this difficult situation, with tools and strategies to empower you and help you regain control over your emotions and life.
Also, if you feel like you nee to talk to someone, you can try these online chat options too:

I would also like to recommend that you focus on your self-care routines. This includes practicing self-compassion, engaging in activities that bring you joy, and finding healthy ways to cope with stress. You can read this article for more ideas about how to manage your self-care: 5 Self-Care Practices for Every Area of Your Life
Last but not least, if you ever feel like you’re in immediate danger or need someone to talk to, consider reaching out to a crisis hotline in Malaysia (Read this: Abuse & domestic violence helplines in Malaysia) . They are available 24/7 and can provide you with support and guidance.

- Women’s Aid Organisation Hotline: +603 3000 8858 (9 am – 5 pm)
- SMS/WhatsApp TINA: +6018 988 8058 (24 hours)
Finally, I just want to encourage you and remind you that you are a strong and resilient person for reaching out and sharing your feelings. It takes courage to open up about what you’re going through. Your life has value, and there is hope for a brighter future.

Thank you for sharing about your situation, it definitely isn’t easy to be vulnerable in sharing about something close to your heart, and I respect your courage for that. It sounds like this situation has been ongoing for a long while now, and I can only imagine the frustration or fear that you may be feeling as a result of the remarks and actions by your father.
If I’m understanding you correctly (feel free to correct me!), it sounds like you may be experiencing some helplessness and feel hurt that your father uses insulting remarks and scolds you for things you may not necessarily have had control over, which can be frustrating as well
I’m concerned when you mentioned that you want to disappear, it sounds like you’re not sure of how to put a stop to this situation that’s causing you so much pain. Since the situation seems to have been present for a while, perhaps there have been certain coping strategies or outlets of self-expression that you’ve found helpful to cope with the situation thus far? (if not it’s perfectly ok as well!) Otherwise, perhaps I can suggest mindline’s website for youths, which includes an AI chat bot, Wysa . It has personally been useful for me to tide over some tougher times, and perhaps it could be a resource for you to tap on when things get stressful. However, I acknowledge that your situation is complex and you may have other preferences and means of coping that works better for you; which I would then encourage you to tap on
To end off, I understand that you may be feeling useless when the environment you’re in may not be supportive, though I believe that you definitely do have unique and valuable strengths that may just have not yet been recognised by others.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings on this platform, it takes a lot of courage to be real and authentic with your struggles and I commend you for your bravery. I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a stressful time, as I can see that you’re dealing with a lot of pressure both academically and at home.
I think that you are really resilient, for wanting to seek help and support (instead of turning to self-harming first) and I want to affirm your efforts by sharing with you a few things you can try instead:
2. Seek Support from the people around you: Try to talk to someone you trust about what you’re going through, whether it’s a friend, family member, teacher, or a counselor at your school. Sometimes when you share honestly about your feelings, it can provide relief and often can help you to find other ways to be supported. You can also consider having an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings and their expectations. It’s possible that they may not be fully aware of the pressure you’re under or the impact it’s having on your mental health.
3. Time Management and Self-Care: It might be helpful for you to create a realistic study schedule that allows for short breaks and self-care moments. Learning to balance your academic responsibilities with self-care activities can help reduce stress Self care can look like exercise, meditation, or hobbies you enjoy. These activities can be helpful in managing stress and improving your overall well-being. Want to know more about self care? Read this: https://mindline.sg/youth/article?type=resource&resource-id=888 and https://mindline.sg/youth/article?type=resource&resource-id=883
4. Seek Professional Help: If you’re feeling the urge to self-harm or experiencing persistent thoughts of self-harm, it’s crucial to seek professional help immediately. You don’t have to go through this alone, and there are mental health professionals who can provide the support and guidance you need.
Whenever you feel overwhelmed and feel the urge to self-harm, please contact these hotlines:
a. SOS: 1-767
b. SOS whatsapp: Share on WhatsApp
c. IMH - 63892222
Just remember, it’s okay to ask for help, and taking care of your mental health is just as important as your academic success. You deserve support and the opportunity to navigate this stressful season but in a healthy way. Please also try your best to reach out to a trusted person or professional who can provide more direct support for you during this time.

i agree with @cottonsoul , it sounds like you have multiple concerns that don’t seem to have straightforward solutions… I can only imagine how overwhelming and stressful it would be to attempt to juggle the financial and social concerns on top of the stress from academics
With regard to your question, here’s a few suggestions for your consideration (though, if none of these are an apt fit for your lifestyle or preferences, it’s totally ok as well! it definitely takes time to slowly explore and find out which coping mechanism may work better)
building on the notion of self-care that cottonsoul suggested, there’s a few aspects of self care that you could look into:
2. physical (eating healthily, staying active, getting enough sleep)
3. emotional (self-expression through art, music etc., self-compassion, journaling)
4. spiritual (spending time with self, connecting with nature, meditation)
I hope that some of these strategies can aid you in coping with the stressors that may be out of your control, and perhaps act as outlets to express your emotions and release some of the accumulated stress! Though ultimately, I do acknowledge that your situation is complex and it may take more than the self-care strategies I listed above to cope with the stressors. In this case, perhaps talking to professionals (be it in-person mental health professionals, or through online platforms such as CHAT, EC2 or Limitless’s discord) may help alleviate your situation!
Once again, thank you so much for your courage to share this with us, and do take care amidst everything!",,1,,,,,

When I was 16 years old, I was granted an opportunity to study in Australia. After arriving for a few days, I was unable to cope with the anxiety plus kept overthinking and return to SG. And at the present, I was granted another opportunity to study in Australia again but I am having difficulties to cope about myself. I keep overthinking about the future like if I go to Australia, will I be able to look a job to cover my daily expenses or if I am at there now, what will my parents do if I am not here with them. They are getting older and I am afraid if I don’t stay with them, I will lost those memories with them. But after debating for so long, in my heart I really want to go but on final decision that I decided to go. I will think what will happen in the future(but haven’t actually happen) and will I be able to get a part time job or will my expenses be enough for me and more, that causes me to go repeat again and again with my decision. But I am scared if I let go this opportunity, I will regret it later. I am scared that my relatives will think me as a loser in life, as I getting all sorts of elder “talks” for them. I am facing difficulties in sleeping and eating. Sometimes after finishing my lunch and dinner, I felt the urge to vomit and would need to do something else to get it off my mind. For sleep, I mostly can’t sleep and will take a long time to sleep because I keep overthinking. I felt like someone is in my brain talking. I was facing this alone, I am afraid to let my family knows about this as my family don’t understand me. I need to wear a “ happy” face whenever I was with them and my relatives. But after staying in my room alone, I tend to get sad and cry a bit. I was facing suicidal thoughts before, thinking if I am dead probably I don’t need to suffer so much. What should I do?",,1,,,,,

Firstly, thank you for choosing to share your feelings and thoughts here on this platform. I want to say that you are really brave and courageous for taking the step to be authentic and vulnerable here, and I commend you for that.

You can try sharing your struggles with a close friend or family member who can provide you with emotional support.
• Focus on Self-Care: Self-care practices to help manage your anxiety and improve your overall well-being.

You may not be aware, but the things that you are worried/overthinking about are the stuff that you can control! You are in charge of this! You have an opportunity to study in Australia, do you have extra savings that can tide you over if you cant find a part time job there?

Do not judge me please. We are in love and his marriage is already on the rocks. Divorce is on the cards when his wife found out about us. She called my phone, scream and hurled insults at me. I deserve it. Me and my bf communicate discreetly after that for abt 1 mth, before he says he have to disappear for a while, during the divorce proceedings. I was distraught during this no contact period. I almost go crazy, I have no mood for anything. I am acting on blind faith. Cried everyday. Two months later, he appreared back saying everything is going on as planned. We manage to meet once, a quick meet as wife is still keeping tabs on him despite divorce is happening. We kept in touch for 4 days before he disappeared. This time without warning. I stalked his wife’s facebook account (she create a new one while we are on no contact) and got hints that a fight is going on. Their shared FB acc disappear. Then she deleted all photos and pictures in her FB and finally deactivate/terminate it. Probably all this is not important bt what is, is that it has been two weeks he didnt text me and I am worried, depressed, sad, anxious.
I feel like I cant do anything and I tried keeping busy but…I felt like I am making progress bt then I go backwards two steps. I prayed so hard when he disappeared for 2 mths and I havent stop praying and talking to God since. I could not text/contact him coz as previous, I do not want his wife to throw evidence to court that we are still communicating. Promises has been made and I agree to be patient.
Just that my feelings and anxiousness is affecting me and this is so so hard. Tried to keep busy, clean my storeroom, clean my wardrobe, I guess I can clean every room in the house to keep busy. This “no contact” is driving me crazy. I know he will message me when he can and when the coast is clear, but I dont know when - and this uncertainty is causing me to have a million things in my head. Overthinking all the time.

First of all, I want to commend you for your courage in sharing your feelings and thoughts here on this platform. Being authentic is such a vulnerable thing to do, and it takes a lot of bravery too. I hear you, and I want you to know that I’m here to support you without judgment. It seems that you’re going through a very stressful, anxious and emotionally intense situation. I understand that you’ve been trying to distract yourself from the anxious feelings and that the lack of communication from your partner is causing a lot of tension emotionally.
Sometimes, when we are in situations where we have a lack of control or we have no clarity/certainty about an outcome, we might experience strong feelings of anxiety – this is a very normal emotional response, so what you’re feeling is very valid and real. Although we can’t change anything beyond our control, we actually do have the power to change some things within our control.
Here are some things that are within your control that you can help yourself with:
2. Focus on self-care : Help yourself to stay grounded by practicing mindfulness techniques. When you stay in the present moment, you can reduce anxious feelings and calm racing thoughts. One thing you can try is deep breathing exercises, especially when you feel overwhelmed. Try to take a few moments to focus on your breath - Deep, slow breaths can help regulate your emotions and reduce anxiety. You can try this activity for more practice: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Establish a Support System:
a. Try to reach out to your friends, family. You don’t have to go through this situation alone. You can confide in someone you trust who can provide emotional support and a listening ear.
b. Consider Therapy: A therapist can provide you with a safe and confidential space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies. Therapy can be immensely beneficial during times of emotional turmoil. You can also try these chat options if you prefer:
i. Limitless : Talk To Someone - Limitless
ii. CPH chat : https://www.cphonlinecounselling.sg/hc/en-us
iii. IMH CHAT : Home - CHAT
iv. ec2.sg : https://fycs.org/ec2-sg
4. Accept Uncertainty: It’s understandable that you want to know when he will contact you, but it’s important for you to accept that you may not have control over the timing. Even though you can’t control WHEN he will contact you again, remember that you can control what you can control, which is your own well-being. You can also try to declutter your mind through this simple activity: https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=declutter_mind
5. Reevaluate Medication: I think it’s important for you to discuss with your doctor about the medications and not to rely too much on OTC medication for the timebeing. If you’ve been prescribed anxiety medication, taking it as directed might be beneficial during this challenging period. It would be best for you to consult your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.
Last but not least, you are not alone. I want to affirm you that it’s entirely normal to feel anxious and overwhelmed. Be patient with yourself, practice self-compassion, and take one step at a time toward healing and emotional well-being.
Do let us know if you need any other resources to help you tide through this period of uncertainty, and keep us updated!

It could be something like I feel like the person is treating me differently from before, or differently from others. I tend to frequently overthink about what others think about me and worry they do not like me or think I’m incompetent or have a poor personality etc. In the past I try very hard to be very nice to everyone but perhaps putting on the niceness facade for too long has led to me feeling tired so I find myself becoming paggro at times these days or having the need to rant just so someone knows I am not happy. On a few rare occasions I even ended up bringing up my insecurity about what the friend thinks of me to the friend, because it gets too debilitating to keep wondering if it is really me having done something that made the person dislike me or if i am just overthinking. Yet I also regret afterwards as perhaps the friend will now think i am being weird and oversensitive and annoying. Or maybe nothing was wrong but me bringing it up is what starts to cause a deterioration in the friendship. After being paggro or ranting I regret it as well since this might lead to others being annoyed of me or perceiving me as not having as good of a personality or feeling unhappy when with me. Or I feel bad that my negative emotions might rub off on that other person I am ranting to and affect that person’s social wellbeing. I know that not everyone can be liked by everyone, but knowing and being able to accept it is different especially given the effort I put in to be as nice and thoughtful as I can to the people around me, yet people may not perceive it this way or maybe it is not reciprocal. Perhaps all these could also be due to how I perceive myself to not be good at doing anything nor particularly smart or pretty and so my identity lies more in my personality thus I feel the need to try and make up for my incompetencies with having a well-liked and desirable personality. Is this normal?",,2,,,,,

First of all, I am really glad you opened up about your feelings and experiences. I can see that you have self-awareness about your insecurities and that you are able to acknowledge your struggles internally. I want to affirm you that what you’re going through is very normal, and it’s something many people struggle with from time to time. Your willingness to address these feelings of confusion and worries about how others think of you, is very commendable - and I respect you for that.
I think that there are many layers to what you’ve shared and it’ll definitely take more than just one post to explore these, but perhaps it might be good (after this) to process it with your counsellor or a mental health professional. For example, it’s true what you said that we can’t be liked by everyone, and there’s possibility that this ‘need’ for acceptance is driven by a poor sense of self (which takes a long time to develop!)
Perhaps a few questions you can ask yourself are:
- About the idea of making up for the incompetencies - one can also argue that a person’s incompetencies can be seen as another person’s strength, and (if I could really go even deeper here), what is your definition of incompetency?
- Is it fair to label ourselves as incompetent just because we think we haven’t ‘reached the mark’ or is it just a lack of (example) skill there?
- Where did you get the idea of a standard/mark that you should be like?
- What happens when you don’t hit that standard?
- Does that standard apply to all of us?
- Would that mean that we’re all falling short of the standard and thus we are all incompetent?
These could be some questions to mull about, but I would highly encourage you to bring these thoughts into a therapy session with a mental health professional
I think that your self-awareness is truly a strength and a sign of discovering who you are, so keep it up! For the time being, while you’re exploring and processing some of those thoughts deeper, you could try these strategies to help tide you through the moments when you feel overwhelmed:
2. Mindfulness: Mindfulness can help you stay present in the moment and reduce the tendency to overthink or catastrophize about what others may think of you. Try this: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Be compassionate to yourself. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend. When you catch yourself in negative thought patterns, practice self-compassion by reminding yourself that everyone has insecurities and it’s okay to have them. Try this activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
4. Challenge Negative Assumptions: When you find yourself assuming that others dislike you or perceive you negatively, take a step back and challenge these assumptions. Ask yourself if there is concrete evidence to support these beliefs or if they are based on your own perceptions and interpretations. Often, our minds can create scenarios that aren’t grounded in reality, and by questioning them, you can gain a more balanced perspective. Try this activity to challenge these negative thoughts: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Last but not least, I want to encourage you that it’s perfectly normal to have moments of self-doubt and to want to be liked by others, but, it’s also important to strike a balance between being considerate of others’ feelings and taking care of your own emotional well-being.
In any case, we’re here for you on this platform - always ready to listen. Do let us know if you’ve tried these strategies and activities, and what else worked for you.

Personally I feel it’s great that I came to this relisaton and awareness, I think it’s also cause my body is sending a signal to do something about this because honestly while work can be and is actually a good distraction (for me), it’ll become deterimental (exhaustion, burning out etc) if done in excess (which most likely happen soon if I don’t intervene soon).
The worrying sign is that I find myself spiralling into low mood when I’m not working… I’ve been working OT or taking extra shifts at work as a way to cope and I’ve become acustomed to that lifestyle that when I’m not working, I become bored easily and will feel restless.
I do acknowledge this issue and hence also why I wanted to ask for advice on how can I disengage from work and what can I do to replace “work”. I have some ideas in mind (self-care etc) but I think the thing on my mind too is to how to find motivation to do these things and not feel like work is the only way to distract myself/ cope.

It’s really commendable that you’ve taken time to do some self-reflection. In a fast paced society like Singapore, many of us (myself included) get caught up in the busyness and forget about self-reflection.
I’m no expert but I’ve faced a similar situation like you where I bury myself in work to distract myself from other struggles. I think it’s important to first find what you enjoy doing outside of work. Once you have identified that, you can slowly transition to doing more of your new-found hobby.
It’s very easy to jump right back into work because it’s a coping mechanism that we’re so familiar with so I make a conscious effort to turn off work-related notifications after working hours. I’m a calendar person so I also try to block time off to try new things. Having that dedicated time will help to prioritise hobbies so that you don’t have that much of “free time” for you to go back to work.
For me, I’ve started gymming and running more often while listening to my favorite tracks. It’s a good way to stay healthy while indulging in some precious alone time. What are some of the self care ideas you have in mind?",,0,,,,,

First of all, I’m so sorry for the delay in responding to your post. We’re trying to respond to everyone’s post personally so it has taken us some time. Finally here! Thank you for being so patient
You know, as I read your sharing, I’m really glad you’ve taken the time to reflect on your coping mechanisms and have recognized the need for change. It’s truly an important step towards a more balanced life and a healthier state of mental and emotional well-being.
I want to affirm you that the way you’re coping (drowning yourself in work) is actually quite a normal thing for people to do when they’re trying to distract themselves. And when work is ‘absent’ or when there’s no work left to do, the downward spiral begins because there’s a sense of emptiness and lack of purpose for that moment (hence the restless feeling that you experience). So it truly is a very normal thing that people do - and your feelings are completely valid.
Sometimes we find it difficult to disengage from work or keeping ourselves distracted because we haven’t found another alternative, or we just don’t have the motivation to try out some self-care activities. It’s understandable that we would not have any ‘excitement’ or energy about doing something new, instead of something we’re used to.
I want to encourage you to try these things to help you disengage from work and find healthier ways to cope:
2. Gradual Transition:
I can imagine that making a sudden shift from using work as your primary coping mechanism to embracing leisure activities may feel challenging. Instead of quitting work-related activities abruptly, consider a gradual transition. You can begin by setting boundaries on your work hours and allowing yourself designated periods for work and clearly defined breaks. Over time, you can reduce the extra hours you spend on work and replace them with activities you find enjoyable and fulfilling.
3. Explore Interests and Hobbies:
Perhaps the reason why you feel unmotivated to try self-care activities is because you haven’t found one that you will truly enjoy? Engaging in activities that genuinely interest you can be a great way to find motivation outside of work. You can start by making a list of hobbies or interests you’ve had in the past or would like to explore first - and then trying each out. Whether it’s painting, playing a musical instrument, gardening, reading, or any other activity, make sure to allocate time in your schedule for these pursuits. You can start with small, manageable goals that can make it easier to build motivation and develop a sense of enjoyment in non-work activities.
4. Mindfulness and Self-Care:
I encourage you to incorporate mindfulness practices and self-care routines into your daily life. Mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce the restlessness or boredom you may experience when not working. Additionally, prioritize self-care activities that nurture your mental and emotional well-being. This can include practices like meditation, yoga, journaling, or simply taking quiet moments to relax. Remember that self-care is not selfish; it’s essential for maintaining balance and preventing burnout. You can try this meditation activity that can help you get started: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Finally, remember that it’s okay to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist as you navigate this transition. They can offer encouragement, accountability, and a listening ear as you work on finding healthier ways to cope with your feelings and mental health struggles.
I’m proud of you for taking a positive step towards self-care and well-being, and with time and effort, I believe that you can have a healthier and more balanced approach to your life.

No worries about the late reply! In fact, I really appreciate the reply.
When I wrote this post, (I had a different user name) haha but I was also struggling with the recent departure of my sch counsellor. I was really close with her and even though I tried to stay strong, I took the news really hard and her absence really took a toll on me.
However fast forward to today and I’m coping better, work wise, I make it a point to schedule off days every week.
When my sch counsellor left, I was assigned a replacement counsellor, at first even though he’s really nice and great, it was quite difficult to open up to him mainly cause I was still trying to get over my previous counsellor’s departure and wasn’t ready to a new relationship but It’s definitely slowly getting better.
Additionally, in another Let’s Talk post, I did mention about wanting to see a psychologist again (mainly one that does psychodynamic therapy) and I’m glad I managed to find one (thanks to a friend’s recommendation). I’d just had my 3rd session yesterday and so far it’s been great/amazing…
All in all though occasionally there’s still some turbulence and difficulty, things have generally been looking up for me and I’m really thankful for that.",,1,,7034,,7034.0,

But it only starts to get worst when she mention ""At one point, I don’t want to be around anymore* it caused me to worry and fear for her ownself and her safety, especially when she didn’t reply me, which made me had a meltdown as I thought she had did something to herself but she didn’t and clarify with me that she is in safe hands with her friends and mother.

I chanced upon your post and I find myself relating to what you shared.
Sometimes the days following an argument might actually be more tormenting as our minds replay the scenes over and over again. Especially when the people that we argued with were once close to us, it must have been a really difficult period for you. How are things for you now? I’m wondering if you managed to resolve the conflict or find closure for yourself.
Also, it sounds to me like your friends tend to look for you when they are in need of support. I’m glad that your friend has you to rely on, even though you two have not spoken for a while. However as we make ourselves available to support others, it can definitely be mentally taxing when we empathise and show genuine concerns.
As a peer supporter myself, I do feel that way sometimes and I would take it as a sign for me to do some self-care activities. I hope you know that caring for yourself is not selfish, it’s key if you want to support others in the long-term. I’m proud that you’re taking that first step to go for counseling, it shows that you are not delaying your own self-care.

Firstly, I would like to apologise for the delayed response to your post. There has been so many posts on this forum and we have been working hard to get through responding to each post personally, so admittedly it took some time for us to reach here - I’m so sorry about this!
As I read your post, I just want to tell you how brave you are in sharing your painful experiences on this forum. It takes a lot of courage to be so real here, telling us about your stresses and worries and how you’ve tried counselling but it only worked for a while. And you know what? All your feelings are completely valid You should never have to apologize for sharing your feelings and experiences; so please don’t feel bad for being on this platform - we are here to help and support you.
I can imagine that the argument and the concern for your friend’s well-being have been taking a toll on your emotional well-being. I know it might feel like just a temporary relief, but perhaps you can try to see your counsellor on a regular basis. Just imagine our heart as a huge container - the more often we go to the counsellor to “pour” out our emotions and process them together, the “lighter” we will feel. It might not take just one or two sessions to completely feel better; it could take weeks or months to start feeling like you’re healing… But I encourage you to not give up Your counsellor will be able to continue to equip you with tools to help you cope too.
In the meantime, I’d like to offer you two strategies that may help you during this challenging period, especially when you feel overwhelmed by your thoughts:
2. Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques:
When negative memories or worries start to overwhelm you, try practicing mindfulness and grounding exercises. These techniques can help you stay in the present moment and reduce the impact of intrusive thoughts. One effective grounding exercise is the 5-4-3-2-1 method: Identify and describe five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This exercise can help shift your focus away from distressing thoughts and bring you back to the here and now. You can also try out this activity which can help: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Decluttering your mind:
Sometimes the thoughts can make you feel confused, worried and hurt at the same time and as you mentioned, you might lose concentration and start to fear about everything. I encourage you to try this activity (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg ) and it can help you to practice decluttering your mind and regain clarity.
Last but not least, I want to emphasize that healing takes time, and it’s okay to have moments when you feel like your emotions are taking over. What’s important is that you’re taking steps to address your feelings and seek support through counseling and talking about your experiences. Over time, with the right support and coping strategies and tools, you can work towards regaining your emotional well-being and finding a sense of balance and peace.
Please also remember that you’re not alone in this, and there are people who care about your well-being and want to help you through this challenging period (like us on this platform! )

It’s my holidays now and for 2 months I’ve had such low esteem and my inner-sabotage constantly got the better of me. Honestly, its really strange. Since Upper-Sec or as far back as I can recall, school holidays were never the best time for me. Strangely, I would feel incredibly lost and just lazy. If you can call it there, I lack the motivation to really do anything. I wish I took care of myself better or I wished I had my self-love to do so.
I can’t really pinpoint why I feel this way, is it because of the lack of schedule, lack of a productive purpose (one that society tells us we have to be a part of) or is it just because I have nothing that is distracting me from my deepest darkest thoughts?
I genuinely cannot keep feeling this way, I am so sick and tired of being so angry at the world, at myself and just sad and stuck. I think the worse thing about these emotions/thoughts is that it can make you feel so worthless that you convince yourself it’s better to stay at home, better to not meet your friends, or better just to wait it out. But it’s just not true.
I don’t really know how to much forward anymore, but I’m just trying my best to pull myself out of this, because I don’t want to feel this way much longer.",,3,,,,,

I am glad that you found this space safe enough to share your thoughts freely. Personally, I really relate to you when you said you could not quite identify why you feel this way. For me, spiralling in this thought of not knowing what I am feeling, or how to get out of it, makes things feel way worse. Things would only start getting better when school resumed, i.e. I was obliged to be busy with school and all. But I feel you and I hear you, it can feel so lonely and helpless at times. And I am happy that you reached out to seek solutions – it shows the effort you are putting in to get yourself out of things which I really admire, and failed to do so when I was younger.
You mentioned that you lack the motivation to do anything, what do you wish to do, and how do you wish you could take care of yourself better?
I am also just wondering who knows what you are going through? For me, talking to a couple of friends help. I know it feels counter-intuitive and to some extent uncomfortable when you are feeling unworthy. For me, it helped a lot hearing from my friends what I needed to hear, affirmation that I was doing okay. I hope that you will be able to hear the words you so very deserve to.

Firstly, I am so sorry for the delay in responding to your post. We have had many posts on this forum and we needed some time to sieve through and respond to each one, and I thank you for your patience!
I’m really sorry to hear that you’ve been experiencing such a challenging time during your holidays. I want to assure you that it is entirely normal for anxious thoughts and depressive thoughts to affect your motivation and self-esteem, especially when you’re feeling lost and lacking a sense of purpose. I want you to know that you’re not alone in these feelings, and I’m here to support you.
I want to encourage you that even though we may not be able to pinpoint the exact cause or factor for these low feelings, I am proud of you for having the self-awareness to know how you’re feeling and to be authentic enough to share it on this platform. I commend you for being so brave and real, it takes a lot of courage to share what you did.
Sometimes our thoughts can be so negative that it can cause us to doubt ourselves and make us feel low and maybe almost feel like we’re losing the inner battle, and I acknowledge that it can be difficult to pull ourselves out of this seemingly deep and dark hole that never ends.
I encourage you to take some time to try out these strategies below to help yourself (especially in those moments when you feel very overwhelmed!), and equip yourself with some tools for self-empowerment
2. Create a Structured Routine:
As you mentioned, the lack of schedule and a productive purpose can contribute to these feelings. How about trying to create a daily routine for yourself during your holidays? This routine doesn’t have to be overly ambitious; it can include simple tasks like setting regular wake-up and bedtime, allocating time for self-care activities (like drawing or taking a walk), and setting achievable goals for the day. When you have a routine, it can provide a sense of stability and accomplishment, helping to counteract the feelings of laziness and lack of motivation.
3. Practice Self-Compassion and Seek Support:
It’s okay to have challenging moments and emotions - everyone does. But please do be kind and patient with yourself during this time. You mentioned a desire for self-love, and you know, that actually starts with self-compassion Try to reach out to supportive friends or family members and share your feelings with them. Sometimes, just talking about what you’re going through can help you feel supported and help you feel less alone. You can also try this activity to help practice kindness to yourself: https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=be_kind
On a side note, if you find that these negative emotions persist and significantly impact your daily life, I encourage you to speak to a mental health professional who can provide you with additional tools and strategies and support you through this season.
I can see that you don’t want to feel this way any longer and you’re really trying your best to pull yourself out of it - and I applaud your efforts. Remember that healing and progress can take time, and it’s okay to seek help and support along the way. You have the strength to overcome these challenges, and I’m here to support you throughout your journey to a happier, healthier and stronger self.

First of all, thank you for sharing your feelings and experiences with us on this platform. It takes courage to open up about what you’re going through, and I commend you for your bravery. It sounds like you’re struggling with anxiety, mood swings, and intrusive thoughts, and I believe seeking professional help will be beneficial for you.
While it’s entirely understandable that talking to someone can be intimidating, especially if you’re experiencing social anxiety, a mental health professional can provide you with the support and guidance you need. You don’t have to go through this alone. Therapists and counselors are trained to help individuals with a wide range of emotional and mental health challenges. They can work with you to identify the underlying causes of your anxiety and mood swings and provide effective strategies to manage them.
For the first step, perhaps you can speak to your school counselor or any Family Service Centre that is within proximity to your home. You can let them know that you’re struggling emotionally and you need help – and they will be there to assess and support you. If the thought of speaking to someone in person is overwhelming, you may want to consider teletherapy or online counseling options, which can provide a degree of anonymity and comfort
When it comes to exploring medication options, it’s good to know that medication can be a helpful part of treatment for some individuals experiencing mood disorders and anxiety. However, only a psychiatrist (doctor with mental health training) can assess your symptoms and determine if medication might be appropriate for you. If you would like a diagnosis or more understanding about your symptoms, please read this: https://www.aic.sg/body-mind/get-mental-health-diagnosis
In the meantime, it’s essential to practice self-care and develop coping strategies to manage anxiety and mood swings. Simple relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or progressive muscle relaxation, can help you reduce anxiety in the moment. Here are some helpful exercises that you can try:

4. Stay positive: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
I want to affirm you again for your efforts in reaching out. Please remember that you are not alone in this, and there is support available for you. Regardless of how you choose to seek help, I encourage you to not give up on yourself and continue working on your mental health journey.

In my experience, once you get rejected by one insurer, it’s often hard to get insured by another insurer because insurers often ask whether you have been rejected before.
Not sure how previous rejections influence insurability but the fact that they ask it suggests that they take previous rejections into consideration.
On a side note, all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents are also covered under MediShield Life (MSHL), regardless of pre-existing conditions, including mental health conditions. MSHL is sized to cover 9 in 10 bills in the subsidised wards of public healthcare institutions. (taken from the Parliamentary Question above)
Other options include going for Group Life Insurance that require no underwriting (eg company insurance or Aviva-Singlife if your friend or their spouse has gone through NS). For Aviva-Singlife, I think there’s a certain quantum (iirc up to $250k) that doesn’t require any underwriting.
For Health Insurance I think it’ll be a lot harder. I’ve heard of certain international medical plans that require no underwriting or Moratorium underwriting - go google this. Need to do a bit more research and speak to an insurance agent that you can trust. Many insurance agents don’t really know how to handle unique cases like this and end up just selling you the standard plans which will get rejected in the end, wasting everyone‘s time. Haha

You’ve already mentioned that some of your friends have noticed your scars and have been understanding.

It’s essential to have people you can talk to when the urge to self-harm arises.
4. Self-Care and Coping Strategies: Develop a toolbox of healthy coping strategies to manage difficult emotions and urges. These could include activities that help you relax and de-stress, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, journaling, art, or physical exercise.

I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a challenging time, and I truly empathize with your situation. I am proud of you for taking this step to reach out for support on our community platform here. It’s commendable that you want to do well in your exams despite experiencing symptoms of depression. Sometimes, coping with both academic responsibilities and mental health issues can be incredibly tough, and that is why seeking support is so important.
I would like to share a few suggestions that might help:
2. Reach Out for Support: Please don’t hesitate to talk to someone about what you’re going through, whether it’s a friend, family member, or a mental health professional. When you share your feelings and concerns with someone, it is actually a significant first step toward getting the help and understanding you need. It’s also good to consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and strategies for managing your depression. They can also help you develop coping mechanisms for studying during this challenging time.
3. Create a Study Plan: Break your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. You can also try to set realistic goals for each session, and make a schedule that accommodates your energy levels and mood fluctuations. Remember that consistency is key, even if it means studying for shorter periods.
4. Practice Self-Care: Prioritize self-care routines that can help improve your mood and overall well-being. This includes getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and engaging in physical activity. Even short walks or light exercises can be beneficial! If you need some practice, you can try out these resources that we have to help you get going:
a. Deep breathing to keep you calm - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg

c. Mindfulness activities - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
d. Releasing your worry - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Last but not least, I want to encourage you that it’s entirely normal to have difficulties studying while dealing with signs of depression. Your well-being should always be a priority, so don’t be too hard on yourself, and take things one step at a time.

It takes courage to open up about your feelings. It’s important to remember that you don’t have to go through this alone, and there are ways to help you feel better.
Do you have friends or family members that you can talk to? While opening up can be scary, consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about your struggles. Sometimes, those closest to us are more supportive than we think. They may not be aware of how you’re feeling unless you tell them. If talking face-to-face is hard, maybe try texting someone close to you.
You mentioned seeing a school counselor in the past, but it didn’t go well. That’s okay; it can be challenging to open up at first. However, I encourage you to give it another try or seek out a therapist or counselor outside of school. They are trained to help you navigate your feelings and provide a safe, non-judgmental space.
Remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve support and assistance on your journey to feeling better. You are not alone in this, our community is here for you and there is hope for improvement.",,1,,,,,

First of all, I love the username. It shows your desire for positive change! I’m encouraged by that. Secondly, I’m really so sorry that you’re experiencing anxiety in almost every part of your life as you described, and you also feel worried about opening up to others. I want to say that it really takes strength to open up about the challenges you’re facing, especially when there’s self-doubt weighing heavily on you. I can imagine how anxious you might be feeling, and it’s normal for people to struggle with these moments of self-doubt and anxiety. I commend you for your bravery for sharing on this platform.
I want to encourage you that you’re not alone in this, and perhaps it’ll be good to try out these suggestions for yourself:
- Take small steps when seeking help and support. You don’t need to share everything all at once, but you can begin slowly by expressing your feelings to your trusted friends or family members who can provide emotional support and encouragement.
- Be kind and compassionate to yourself! Self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend facing similar challenges. Practicing self-compassion can help improve your self-esteem and reduce self-hate. Try this activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Take deep breaths whenever you feel anxious, this activity can guide you through on how to do the exercise : Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Most importantly, I encourage you to stay open to receiving help. Sometimes it does take a few attempts to find the most suitable and right therapist for yourself, it’ll take awhile to be comfortable. Don’t be discouraged by a previous experience, as I believe there are many professionals who genuinely care for you and want to help you.
Remember that you are deserving of help and support, and your well-being matters. Your feelings are valid, and there are people who genuinely care about your well-being, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. Taking the first step toward seeking help is a significant and brave decision.

It takes time to open up and it’s okay to struggle opening up, sometimes I find myself unable to speak during sessions too because I’m just too overwhelmed. What might help is if you write down what you wanted to share before coming to session or if you’d suddenly blanked out during session, maybe you could bring a notebook and pen to communicate during sessions.

I’m so sorry to hear that you’re going through this tricky emotional situation with your crush. I want to affirm you that it’s completely normal to feel hurt and disappointed when things don’t work out the way you hope, especially when it involves someone you care about deeply.
I can imagine how tough it is when you express your feelings to someone and they don’t feel the same way. Rejection can be painful, and it’s 100% okay to feel sad about it. I also empathize with you completely, that your crush’s interest is in your ex-best friend; this can be a double blow, as it may feel like your crush is moving on with someone you used to be close to. It’s natural to feel jealous and hurt in this situation.
Overall, I know it can be distressing and overwhelming for you – I just want to encourage you that it’s okay to cry too. Crying is a form of self-expression, and it’s good to let your emotions out.
I do have some suggestions that might help a little, I hope you’ll consider trying these:
- Give yourself time to heal It’s okay to feel sad, but don’t be too hard on yourself. Healing takes time, and it’s important to allow yourself to process your emotions. Please remember not to rush yourself into feeling okay, give yourself all the time you need.
- Reflect on the situation and take some time to think about what you’ve learned from this experience. Perhaps you could also think about what you want in a friendship or relationship and what you’re willing to accept.
- Focus on self-care! Keep yourself cared-for by engaging in activities that make you feel happy and fulfilled. You can also spend time with friends who support you and engage in hobbies or interests that bring you joy.
Again, I want to commend you for seeking support here on this platform, but do remember that it’s okay to seek help from friends, family and even a therapist too! Sometimes talking to someone about how you feel can help you process your emotions and thoughts better

I hear that you have been feeling sad because you are not where you want to be in your career and, at the same time, feeling scared about not being able to land a job and, most notably, not being able to achieve your goals in life. All these have also contributed to you doubting your capabilities and even affecting your self-confidence and self-esteem.
From your message, you have tried many ways to cope with these emotions. If I hear you correctly, you seek an escape or way out.
Thank you for coming to this platform and for sharing with us.
It is understandable to be experiencing feelings of stress and anxiety in response to difficult situations such as these. If managed in an effective manner, these feelings can be temporary and will eventually come to pass. In your case, however, I’m hearing that these feelings have also brought about thoughts of death. I’m glad that you’ve taken the first step to reach out for support by sharing these emotions with me, but I would also like to urge you to seek Professional help in order to address these thoughts and feelings as soon as possible. You may refer to this page (1) or this directory (2) for a list of hotlines and organisations that you could consider reaching out to. These Professionals will be able to work through these thoughts and feelings in-depth with you.
In the case whereby these thoughts on death become more frequent and/or intrusive, I urge you to please approach SOS (Call 1-767) or IMH (Call 6389 2222) immediately. To make sure you’re kept safe until you manage to get the necessary help, please also approach a trusted friend/family member to highlight your struggles and to accompany you in the meantime.
I would also like to share that we all come with our own sets of skills and interests, and we may not always make perfect career choices – this is perfectly okay. I would like to remind you that switching jobs upon realising that a particular role may not be for you is in no way a reflection of your competency nor a sign of weakness, and commend you for making that decision for the sake of your mental well-being. Although it may feel like it at the moment, I assure you that you are most definitely not alone in this experience. Many of us, especially in the early years upon graduation, go through more frequent job changes and end up having to navigate the job search process. I encourage you to reach out to friends, family, and support groups for support in this process. In the meantime, here are a couple of things you could do to help you cope:
1. Practice self-compassion
Self-compassion is the concept of accepting yourself for who you are and treating yourself with the same kindness, care and understanding that you would extend to a good friend. In trying times, we may become particularly self-critical and this can compound the feelings of stress and anxiety. One way to help you practice self-compassion is by identifying positive self-statements that are uplifting to you, such as “I am doing the best I can”, “I am worthy of compassion” and repeating these to yourself whenever difficult thoughts or emotions arise. If this is challenging for you, you could try thinking about it from a different angle – what would you say to a good friend going through the same situation? We often allow more room for mistakes when it comes to others. Give yourself the same kind of permission to be human and remember that you’re not alone in being imperfect - we all have our own set of flaws. You may refer to this thread (3) for more ways of practicing self-compassion.
2. Set SMART goals for yourself
Periods of uncertainty can make us feel lost and helpless, and this sometimes can paralyse us. Something that could keep us going is to set realistic goals that you are able to focus on daily. SMART goals should be: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For example, the goal “Finding a job” could be made more specific by breaking it up into smaller goals – what are some of the things that you could do every day in order to eventually help you get there? Here is a worksheet with guiding questions for you to try out (4).
Remember that these goals do not necessarily all have to do with your career situation. This period of time could also be an opportunity for you to focus on self-care and to get to know yourself better – some questions you could ask yourself are: Are there any particular interests you would like to develop further? Are all of your basic needs (e.g. sleep, nutrition) being met and if not, is there anything that you could adjust to help you with that?
Lastly, I’d like for you to know that it is okay to take time for yourself to process your feelings and to take care of your mental health. Be patient with yourself and give yourself the time and space you need to heal. Please take care and I wish you all the best.

Thought I’ll share some practical suggestions on top of what @YuanYang has suggested.
Finding a job sounds like a top priority but it’s also important to find one that fits your skills and expectations. Otherwise, you may burn out and feel the same way you did for your previous job.
In the meantime, while you’re searching you could consider taking up freelance opportunities to get sufficient cash flow. At the same time, to give yourself more time to find a job, maybe can consider reducing expenses as well so you don’t feel overly stressed about money running out.
Hope this helps and that you’ll find a suitable job soon!",,3,,2685,,2685.0,

I’m not sure exactly why you chose to leave but I think you did well prioritizing your wellbeing and choosing to leave because that must’ve been very difficult and you’ve endured for quite some time.
Similar to what @Jaws has mentioned it does sound like finding another job is your top priority right now and take your time thoroughly researching about the possible companies you’re applying for as well as preparing yourself for the interviews. (There’s this youtube channel ‘CareerVidz’ that always helps me prepare my answers to interviews I hope that helps you )
Also please don’t think that you’re a failure for making the choice to leave a terrible situation, if anything I believe it shows you have amazing strength to stand up for yourself. No matter how inexperienced you are competency, skills or abilities are something you will build overtime and it’s best that you find yourself a working environment that encourages and nurtures you to be the best version of yourself
Life is certainly hard and it’s deeply saddening to hear that it’s pushed you to even consider death but I’m really glad that you’ve reach out to us which shows that you aren’t ready to give up yet!

Thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts here. I’m so sorry to hear that you have not been able to sleep well because you’re experiencing feelings of fear, confusion and frustration too… It must be really exhausting for you, and I’m sorry that this whole situation has caused you so much anxiety. I want to commend you for being so brave in sharing your troubles, it’s not easy to go through this, but remember that you’re not alone.
Sometimes we may not have the exact reasons for why we feel scared or paranoid when we sleep, or why we feel anxious about resting. There could be various complex reasons, and it’s something you can slowly work with a mental health professional about one day - try speaking to a counsellor or therapist to dig deeper about what you’re experiencing! The therapist will be able to guide you to the root issues and you can process them together.
Meanwhile, I would like to suggest some readings to help you understand this sleepless situation:
2. Read about what might be causing the sleep issues (Understanding sleep problems - Article )
3. Some helpful practical tips to prepare yourself for sleep (How to sleep better - Article )
4. Some possible reasons for why you might not have a good rest (Why can't I sleep? Reasons for trouble sleeping - Article )

- 3 min deep breathing activity ( Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg)

If there is any advice I can give, it will be to give yourself time and to be kind to yourself. Time heals and our views on situations do change with maturity and life experience.

Firstly, I’m really so sorry for what you’ve experienced about your friendships. Feeling betrayed by close friends can be a very painful experience, and it’s understandable that those emotions continue to affect you. The fact that you’ve moved on from the incident itself shows resilience and adaptability - and I’m proud of you for that.
Sometimes, the emotional impact can continue to linger in us. It’s completely normal to have moved on from the specific incident but still hold onto the emotions and feelings associated with it. Emotions can be complex and may take time to process and heal, even after the event itself is in the past. And to me, I feel that it’s important to acknowledge and honor our feelings.
Seeking closure is a personal choice, and it’s not always necessary or beneficial for everyone. Closure can involve revisiting painful memories and conversations, and it’s entirely valid to choose not to go through that process if you feel it would cause you more distress.
Instead, you can focus on self-healing and managing the emotions tied to the betrayal. Here are a few steps you might consider:
2. Self-Compassion: Be kind and compassionate toward yourself Please know that it’s okay to still feel the emotions related to the betrayal. These feelings don’t make you weak or inadequate. To help you be kind to yourself, you can try this activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
3. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a therapeutic way to process and release emotions. You don’t have to share this with anyone; it’s for your own self-reflection. You can also try to declutter your mind through this simple activity: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
4. Mindfulness and Relaxation: Mindfulness practices and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, can help you manage and reduce emotional distress. Here is one activity you can try for a start: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
5. Talk to Someone: You can consider confiding in a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. Talking about your feelings with someone you trust can provide support and understanding. A therapist will also be able to help you with specific strategies and techniques to help you tide through this season of your life.
6. Focus on Self-Care: Engage in activities and self-care practices that promote your overall well-being. This might include exercise, hobbies, spending time with supportive people, or seeking therapy.
Finally, please know that healing takes time, and it’s a gradual process. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to grieve the loss of the friendship and work through the emotions at your own pace.
Ultimately, it’s about finding what works best for you in terms of coping and healing. Your emotions are valid, and it’s okay to take the time you need to move forward.

I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re going through such a challenging time at school, and I appreciate your honesty and willingness to share your feelings and experiences with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your emotions, especially when they are linked to past traumas - and I commend you for your bravery.
I hear you, feeling isolated and abandoned by your classmates can be incredibly painful, and it’s understandable that these experiences would trigger memories of your childhood trauma. I want to acknowledge that your feelings are completely valid, and it’s not your fault for being sensitive to the words and actions of others. Sometimes, past wounds can make us more vulnerable to similar feelings in the present.
The physical and emotional symptoms you’ve described, such as increased sleep, appetite changes, and crying at night, are all indicative of the emotional toll this situation is taking on you. It’s a natural response to distress and sadness. I would like to affirm you that you don’t have to go through this alone, and there are ways to seek support.
It’s a positive step that you’ve recognized the need to reach out and share your feelings. Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional can provide you with a safe space to express your emotions and receive the support you need. They can also help you explore strategies to cope with the negative feelings and improve your overall well-being.
For starters, you can also try these simple activities to help you manage the negative feelings:

- Meditation : Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Declutter your mind : Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
If you’re comfortable with it, do consider discussing your feelings with a counselor or therapist who can provide guidance and techniques for managing your emotions and the impact of past trauma. Therapy can be a valuable resource for working through these difficult emotions and developing resilience.
Last but not least, I want to affirm you that healing is a process, and it’s okay to seek help and take the time you need to recover. You are not alone in this journey, and there are people who care about your well-being and want to support you.

Suddenly there’s a big hoohaa about this term.
I’m thankful that Mental health has become a big thing thanks to advocacy. We better understand what is mental health and how it is important to all of us. Schools have more Mental health related talks and even provide hotlines. Some schools have Peer support training for school peer supporter. Even from a younger person’s POV, the older generation do make a point to be curious about this topic. Social organisation have also try to do many outreach in the hopes of educating the public through many events.
Maybe we might have gone pass stereotypes and stigma, have we?
The next question is: is it enough? We have definitely gone pass mental health advocacy. But the question is does mental health advocacy lead to mental health understanding? Have you come across someone passing you a leaflet, only for you to throw it away? Have you heard of a classmate laughing, "" wow, exam is so stressful, I WANT TO DIE."" or “Wow I think I have TRUAMA/DEPRESSION” without truly understanding what it means? Social media so no help either as people do fall in the trap of self diagnosing themselves and believing in psychology tricks without like actually thinking if it is a reliable stats or data. (I seen it all over TikTok.) Suddenly we are all expert in the mental health field.
Bits of my Personal journey with mental health
Mental heath has been somewhat dear to me, I first started my advocacy 6 months ago after my O’levels. But first, I wanted to work on my healing journey first.
Singapore glorified that I should seek help! See a therapist. So with whatever strength I have left, I clinged on to my hope and went to therapy for the first time on my own. To all the therapist out there, you know how social services have this confidentiality form. It was so scary man. But I went in for my first session cause they say I do not need perental consent only for the first session. Honestly, I find it hard to gauge my first session. But for the next session, I had to get my parents to sign with My mom asking me about what problems I have. (You don’t need to have problems to go for therapy btw!) “Anxiety lor”. Soon I went to the next session. And the next. And I think my parents forgotten about therapy because we never brought it up ever again. Sometimes Im wondering if they know I’m suffering at all. I’m currently more than 10 session in.
At the age of 17, I was all alone desperately finding help.
Here is a presenting problem: I’m not getting better. I know how I was taught that healing is not linear. Which I totally agree. But you know when you are stuck in this vicious cycle and you really want to get out, your next instinct is desperation? I’ll do anything I can.
So I looked into other organizations: free Mental health assessments; some social services programmes for youths, go for talks by different social services, volunteer my time to find like minded people. All these in a desperate attempt.
Sometimes my mental health will get so bad till I can’t get out of bed. There will be hotlines I can use rather than talking to friend who is busy with their own lives or family members who you are not close to. All in all, strangers who wouldn’t mind me sharing, plus I’m anonymous!
But I still can’t get any better… so I deleted myself out of my own IG account cause social media is sure damn toxic.
I done the steps. I did what I was told to do. But I still feel the same. The same fucked up feeling still stays within me… nothing got better.
And it’s not like I’ll have the same set of enthusiasm everytime I fail. I want to be okay. I know I’m impatient. Cause I don’t know when I will fall.

4145,Mental health and thoughts,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/mental-health-and-thoughts/4145,Seeking Help,---,3218,Art,User,,5651,2,"First off, let’s take a minute to acknowledge the courage you have found in yourself to come out and speak your heart Gladys. Despite advocacy and movements, the stigma often remains more internal than external, and the hardest part is recognising and being aware that you might have a mental wellness situation going on. Awareness aside, the next big step you took was to seek help, and that’s scary AF, kudos to you for those steps. I think you should give yourself more credit than you think you deserve.
The path to mental wellness is a bit like playing snakes and ladders (not sure if you’ve played it before), but the gist of it is that there will be days where you land on a ladder and feel super good about yourself, and some days when you land on a snake and slide down to a lower level. The goal of snakes and ladders is to reach the end, and the human equivalent is to live a life well lived, so is our journey towards mental wellness.
I can’t say I understand what you’re going through as all our journeys are the same, but the law of universality points that more often than not, most of us are going through similar tribulations, and I’m sure you are going through a hard time. The journey gets harder when we feel unsupported by our loved ones, I agree. But we shouldn’t be relying on it; our journeys are ours to make alone.
I see fierce determination within you to be better in your last paragraph, and I’ll leave you with this. ‘We never fail in life. We either win, or we learn’, so don’t be afraid of falling, you’ll be surprised how much stronger you get each time you get back up.",,4,,,,,

I am really amazed by how resourceful you are and how you pushed through the administrative barriers to get yourself to therapy. Your determination and commitment to your self-healing is admirable.
Despite all your efforts, you shared that you are not getting better and the same feelings stay within you. I’m curious, if you managed to identify what those feelings are? What were the events in your life that led you to feel that way? And what were the triggers that caused these feelings to resurface? Sometimes, when we have exhausted all efforts to seek help externally, it might be worth the attempt to pivot and look inwards instead.
If you are open to share more, I would be happy to listen! Otherwise, it’s okay as well to save the response to these questions in your own personal journal.",,1,,5639,,5639.0,

I sense that you would like your parents to understand and support you better. Have you tried getting a counselling session with your parents involved? Parents, especially Asian parents, are sometimes not very good in expressing their deep love and concern for us. They may not be able to solve our problems but I think their understanding is sometimes a good source of strength and support to keep us going.

First of all, thank you for sharing your honest thoughts and feelings here. It does take a lot of courage to share your journey and experiences with mental health, and I want you to know that you’re not alone. You are a brave one, and it’s really heartening to hear that mental health awareness and advocacy efforts have gained momentum, leading to more resources and support being available, especially in schools.
I agree with your concern - that whether we’ve truly moved past stereotypes and stigma… This is so true, have we really moved past them? One thing I know for certain is that changing attitudes and perceptions about mental health can take a long time, and it’s not always easy for everyone to fully understand the complexity of these issues. People might make casual comments without realizing the impact they can have, and social media can sometimes perpetuate misconceptions.
Your personal journey with mental health highlights the importance of seeking help and reaching out when needed - and I’m proud of you for this! It’s great that you took that step and went to therapy, even though it was initially intimidating. You know, seeking therapy is a really courageous and essential act of self-care. Your experience with confidentiality forms and parental consent is common, but it’s crucial for ensuring your well-being.
I’m truly sorry to hear that you’re feeling stuck and that your mental health hasn’t improved as much as you’d hoped. Healing is indeed not linear, and it can be a challenging and frustrating process. It’s okay to feel impatient and to want things to get better quickly, but please know that there is no fixed timeline for recovery. Each person’s journey is unique
It’s good to hear that you’ve explored various avenues for support, such as attending talks, volunteering, and reaching out to hotlines. These are valuable steps in your recovery journey, and I encourage you to keep seeking the support that feels right for you. It’s also wise to recognize when social media is impacting your mental health negatively and taking a break from it is a healthy decision.
Perhaps you can also try these activities during moments when you feel overwhelmed, they might help you ride through for the moment:
- When you feel anxious or overwhelmed, do deep breathing: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- When you feel clouded by negative thoughts, try this CBT activity: (https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=find_perspective
- When you need to have some optimism, be kind to yourself : Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
All in all, please know that recovery often involves trying different approaches and strategies, and sometimes it can take time to find what works best for you. It’s important to keep communicating with your therapist about your progress and concerns - they are there to support you and adjust your treatment plan as needed.
Again, do continue to reach out to the resources available to you and lean on those who genuinely care about your well-being. I want to encourage you again, there is hope for your healing.

I hate dumping my emotions on others cause I dislike being on the receiving end, but I feel like I am slowly losing grip on everything.
Since for as long as I can remember, I feel like I’ve been just drifting in life and barely scraping by academically, which was how I managed to secure a spot in university in a relatively safe course. However, after enlisting in 2019, life has just been going on for me day-by-day. The period between 2019 and now has felt like such a short time despite this being such an important stage of my life as a university student. My grades have been slipping and I’ve had to retake mods multiple times. At first I was still attending school and going for classes, but now I just running away by skipping. I have not much motivation and interest in whatever I’m studying, so it just feels like a mix of guilt and emptiness just going by my life.
A relative of mine recently commented that I have imposter syndrome, but I couldn’t really agree as I just constantly feel worn out and instead of overpreparing as described in its symptoms, I just don’t put in the work. Rather, I can’t sit down and focus on the contents I’m supposed to study. This lack of motivation and drive has been status quo since I started university and now I am at risk of dropping out.
Waking up everyday has been a challenge and honestly there have been bad days where I’ve seriously considered ending it. Doing things that I considered enjoyable really don’t feel as enjoyable anymore and nothing that I do gives me fulfilment. Seeing my close friend group excelling academically or at work gives me mixed feelings of happiness and envy, where I wish I could do as well as they do.
I can’t even imagine how things will be for me in the future needing to find a 9-5 job IF I can even proceed on and get my degree. I have nothing I want to do and this bleak thoughts are eating at me everyday.
Despite everything, I don’t want to be stuck in this loop anymore. Even if my actions so far have suggested otherwise. I don’t want to wake up everyday feeling worn out and drained, and I want to live life as a normal person, just really feels like I can’t do these easy things.
Thank you for reading this far and I would really appreciate if you have any advice for me.",,2,,,,,

I really urge you to reach out to a mental health professional or SOS when you have these bad days. Your life is precious, and there are people and resources available to support you through this difficult time.

I think the fact that you have posted here is a positive step that you don’t want to be stuck in this loop anymore. Maybe you could try breaking things down into smaller, manageable steps. Take it one mod at a time and make sure you give your best for each mod. If studying for an entire exam is too hard, try studying just 1 chapter and rewarding yourself after that. It’ll help in reinforcing the habit to study. Some of these resources might help: Exam Stress - School & Work . Try not to put too much pressure on yourself about what the future holds. It’s normal to feel uncertain at this stage in life. Sometimes, just taking one step at a time can lead you to unexpected opportunities and interests.

4783,Am i falling into depression?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/am-i-falling-into-depression/4783,Is This Normal?,---,3825,user781,User,,6857,1,"I am 5 months pospartum.
Me and hubby married for the pass 8 years and finally we got a son.
Me and husband have been leaving together ourselves for the pass 3 years, before that we stayed with my dad, (my parents are divorced so as my husbands) as he had an extra room. Now 2 months prior giving birth, my brother in law, decided that he sell their 3 room flat and upgrade. Prior that my mum in law has been staying with them. Now that they have gotten their new 4 room flat, while awaiting renovation works, mum in law stayed with us.
Now heres the thing, i am 6 -7 months pregnant, i had to see another person staying in my household, she wants to cook everyday, so i had to clean up her mess after she cooks. I am not used to all this and feels tired everyday having to clean up after her, even when she eats and drink, crumbs and her coffee stains. I had to clean it up.
Till one day, i thought to myself maybe with this stress and maybe overworked my amniotic sac broke 8 months early into pregnancy. So then came my son… he had to go nicu as he was prematurely born and lungs wasnt that good…i didnt get my skin to skin nor i get to see my son post giving birth, i was so sad. I went to and fro to the hospital daily to see my son post discharge, just so i could try skin to skin and to explore breastfeed with him.
Then one day, he is discharge. So i was hoping my own mum could stay a week at my home to care for me, but no because mil is there, my own mum couldnt take it staying in the same room and bed. So i didnt get much of my own mum own mums cooking. That saddens me.
So months later, i get very depressed and sad, as my mil is there, prevented many things for me, my dad couldnt come as often, she just gets in the way of everything i dreamt of, unable to have a nursery room for my son, my family cant come as freely anymore. I become so sad, i coop up the the room, everytime i see my mil, i want to avoid her and i dont even want to see her. I feel its so unfair, shes leaving in my house. Everyday its like a crime if she doesnt see my baby. And there another issue i dont want her to spend so much time with my baby. I longed for my closeness with my baby and i dont want others to have that.
Even when i go out, she will die die go out and want to see me or my baby out. I feel i have no more privacy and i will die die must face her. Even if shes in the toilet she would quickly go out knowing im going out. Just to see my baby out.
I tired if her living in my home. It seems like she staying here forever, not going back to my brother in laws place. I cant have the bonding i want with just my son and hubby. Please advise, sometimes i cry suddenly, sometimes i feel like harming myself, like thinking what it would be like if i really die. But when i look at my son, i start to cry. My husband doesnt understand me. Its his mum.",,0,,,,,

I can see that you’re facing many challenges and experiencing lots of emotions during this postpartum period, and I want you to know that you’re not alone – it’s entirely valid to feel the way you do.
I am so proud of you for seeking help – it’s a sign of strength, not weakness. You are a strong, wonderful person and I am glad that you came here to reach out for help. As a mother myself, I believe that you have been trying your best to manage and you need the extra emotional support – that’s why this community is here. I want to affirm your efforts, you’re in the right place.
I also want to encourage you firstly, to seek professional help to provide you with the necessary guidance and support, to navigate through these challenges. While I can’t diagnose or assess on this platform, it’s important to note that postpartum depression can look different for everyone – but it is a real and treatable condition. Many mothers find relief and improvement through therapy when they seek professional help, and in some cases, when they receive medical treatment too. Please do try to reach out to a therapist of counsellor who specializes in postpartum issues as they can provide you with a safe space to express your feelings, learn coping strategies, and work through the challenges you’re facing.
The next possible thing you can try to do is to communicate with your husband. It’s essential to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings. You could let him know how his mother’s presence is affecting you and the importance of your emotional well-being during this time. You could also encourage him to be more supportive and understanding.
You could also try to set boundaries with your mother-in-law, explaining your need for space and privacy. You can gently and kindly ask her to respect your alone time with your baby and create a schedule that allows for everyone to have their space in the home. You can also try to find a balance that allows your mother-in-law to be involved without feeling overwhelmed.
One tool you can try when having difficult conversations with your husband or mother-in-law : https://mindline.sg/youth/?wysa_tool_id=resolve_conflict
Last but not least, please do prioritize your own self-care. Self-care activities can help you to relax and reduce your stress. Some things you can try are:
- Taking short breaks for yourself
- Getting rest whenever you can
- Practice mindfulness - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Take deep breaths during overwhelming moments : [Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
Most importantly, if you ever feel like harming yourself, please reach out to a crisis hotline or seek immediate medical help. Your safety is the top priority, and there are professionals available 24/7 to provide assistance.

Thank you for sharing your honest feelings and thoughts here, I commend you for your courage to reach out on this platform. I’m really so sorry to hear that you’ve been going through such a challenging time. I totally understand that you feel overwhelmed, especially with the pressure of upcoming O-levels and the expectations you’re facing.
First of all, feeling suffocated and struggling with the weight of expectations can be incredibly challenging and tiring at the same time. I want to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to seek support during this time. Secondly, I can imagine how stuck you feel when you try to reach out to your friends but you do not receive support like you hope to, and it must be really disappointing to experience that. I’m truly sorry about that too.
I want to encourage you that your feelings are all valid and real, and I am so proud of you for reaching out here. I would like to share with you some things that you can consider:
2. Focus on Self-Care – No wait, make it a priority! Even though studying is important, taking breaks, getting enough rest, and engaging in activities you enjoy can help reduce stress and restore your emotional well-being. You can take a walk, do some drawing, or anything else that helps you to feel peace and rest for that moment.
3. Seek Professional Help - Given your history of self-harm and the current feelings of numbness and the desire to relapse, it would be good to consider professional help. A therapist or counsellor can help you explore and manage your emotions in a safe and supportive environment. They can also help you process your feelings together and provide helpful strategies to cope for this season.
4. Authenticity with Friends - It’s natural to want to be your authentic self around your friends. Consider having an open and honest conversation with them about how you’re feeling. True friends will appreciate your vulnerability and will support you through difficult times. You can start the conversation by sharing how you feel and asking them for their thoughts too.
5. Practice mindfulness to connect with your emotions – You can try this activity : Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg or Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg

I really do feel you in terms with your struggles and I’m really glad to see you reaching out here! Many of us including myself have been through the exam stress and the feeling that your friends are not here for you. I just want to tell you that you should not put so much pressure on yourself and just do your best! Reach out to your teachers as well or even seek help online such as SGExam forum on reddit to get educational resources! I understand that O levels might look scary but based on my own experiences, practicing the ten year series really helps! Maybe your feeling of sadness and numbness is due to being burnt out from your studies, so do remember to keep your health in check by taking breaks and doing some exercises to keep yourself calm. Regarding your friendship issue, I’m really sorry that you feel that way and I hope that there was a form of reconciliation since the time you posted this. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to be a different person in front of them, I believe everyone would enjoy some authenticity in their life.

It’s a brave step to share your feelings and concerns. First of all, remember that your feelings are valid, and you’re not alone in experiencing these challenges.
O’levels is a big milestone and I remember myself being super stressed over it as well. It’s completely normal to feel anxious about your friendships, especially during a transitional period like this. For all you know, your friends may be going through similar feelings too. Maybe discussing about future plans with them could help establish some “common” feelings beyond O’levels - eg going to a specific JC or joining a specific course in poly.
I totally get what you’re saying about getting therapy irl. I also find it hard to verbalise my feelings to a stranger as well. Maybe you’ll find this thread helpful: Restarting therapy

First of all, thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and concerns. I’m so sorry for what you’re experiencing now, with the stress and the fear of being abandoned by your friends. I would just like to assure you that it’s completely understandable to feel stressed as you approach your O-level examinations, because it is indeed a milestone for most of our academic journey. During this time, it’s also normal to feel fearful of changes and potential shifts in friendships, which may add on to your stress. However, I commend you for your dedication to your friends and your desire for positive connections! These are wonderful qualities and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to have friends around you.
You know, I think it’s important to recognize that using laughter as a coping mechanism is a natural response to stress. Laughter can be a way to momentarily relieve tension, and it’s good that you can find moments of levity even amidst your worries.
Your past experiences with being ostracized and bullied can have a huge impact on your self-esteem and feelings of self-worth. It’s completely natural to want to avoid rejection, and it’s important to remember that your worth is not determined by the actions of others. Maybe you can focus on building self-esteem and self-confidence can be part of your personal growth journey!

So i tried to follow as I was assigned at birth, as a male. Time and time again, I’ve been knocked down throughout my work and social life.
I’ve been married for nearly 5 years and have been experiencing psychological abuse for nearly 4 years from my spouse and her mother. I tried to keep it together until my spouse caused me to lose my livelihood in 2021, during the Covid pandemic. This caused my first mental breakdown and that’s when I came out to my spouse.
However, for the last two years, she has been making things really hard for me, not understanding my physical and mental condition. I have been accused of having affairs and not wanting to get a job. Due to my physical conditon, I have to be picky with my employment. People around her has said I’m just making excuses.
After a very minor altercation, my spouse left without wanting to resolve issues that led me into another two mental breakdowns within the same month and this led to my complete coming out as a Trans-female. My spouse initially wanted to reconcile but was threatened by her mother of disownment.
I’m also facing the possibility that I will never be able to see my now 2 year old daughter again. At the same time, I facing homelessness as my spouse wants to take our home and leave me with nothing.
I decided to transition socially but now I’m getting a lot of grief, facing a divorce and negative remarks from the older generation. I’m getting stressed out and i don’t know what to do.
I’ve been diagnosed with drepression and being reviewed for Battered Spouse Syndrome and delayed onset Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
My physical conditions are injured right shoulder, right wrist, right knee and lower back.
My right shoulder and wrist are incurable and limits my carrying weight to less than 4kg. My right knee can only be relieved for up to two years and it will come back with even more pain. As for my lower back, I’ve had two surgeries and the doctor has said if I injure it one more time, it will be metal implants with a 50% chance of being paralysed from the waist down.
I’m really stressed and at a loss on how to carry on.",,3,,,,,

Thank you for your reply. This is exactly what the Family Service Centre counselor said to me.
As for mental health professionals engaged, I’ve been seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist for over two years in one hospital and was recently referred to another psychiatrist at another hospital.
I’ve been in contact with various organizations like National Anti Violence Helpline, Samaritans of Singapore, Rhemaworks International and Oogachaga.
But no one can truly help to attempt to save my marriage as my spouse is now unwilling to accept my trans-identity and/or to work things out.

First of all, I want to thank you for being so truthful and authentic to share your thoughts and feelings. It must be really difficult and painful to be experiencing this whole season. I want to express my deep empathy for everything you’re going through. It’s clear that you’ve faced numerous challenges, and it’s incredibly brave of you to share your journey.
I feel that right now, it’s crucial to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. The psychological abuse you’ve experienced and the challenges related to your transgender identity are undoubtedly taking a toll on your mental health. Your decision to come out and transition socially is a significant step towards living authentically, and it’s okay to seek support as you navigate this process.
Here are some steps you might consider:
- Continue with therapy: I urge you to continue working with mental health professionals who can provide guidance and support. Given your diagnoses of depression, Battered Spouse Syndrome, and delayed onset Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, therapy can be a critical part of your healing journey.
- Supportive Community: Try to connect with LGBTQ+ support groups and organizations that can offer understanding, resources, and a sense of belonging. Many people find comfort in knowing they are not alone in their experiences. They will also be able to point you in the right direction when it comes to knowing how to manage your relationship with your partner too.
- Physical Well-being: Please do focus on self-care and manage your physical conditions. It might be helpful to collaborate with healthcare providers to explore pain management strategies and adaptive techniques for daily life.
- Safety Plan: If you ever feel unsafe in your current living situation, consider creating a safety plan or exploring alternative housing options to ensure your well-being. You can also read this article for more information: How to make a safety plan | Suicide | ReachOut Australia
Again, I empathize with your feelings- they are all valid and real. It is truly understandable that you’re feeling stressed and at a loss right now. Transitioning, divorce, and facing negative remarks can be incredibly challenging, but remember that you have the strength to overcome these obstacles. Healing is a gradual process, and it’s okay to seek help and support along the way.

I’m really so sorry to hear that you’re going through this challenging experience, but I’m here to help you find some strategies to manage these anxious thoughts about your parents’ well-being.
First, it’s important to acknowledge that it’s natural to have concerns about the well-being of our loved ones, including our parents – I personally worry a lot about my loved ones too! So please know that your feelings are all valid and real.
However, when these thoughts become overwhelming and interfere with your daily life, it will be helpful to address them. Here are a few steps you can consider:
- Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Practice mindfulness exercises and relaxation techniques to help you stay grounded in the present moment. This can help reduce the intensity of your anxious thoughts (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg )

Ask yourself if there’s any concrete evidence for your fears, and try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship with them. One activity to try - Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg
- Engage in Enjoyable Activities: Find joy in spending quality time with your parents and creating positive memories together, such as going out for special meals or cycling together or playing boardgames too. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help shift your focus away from worries
- Focus on Self-Care: Prioritize self-care activities, including getting regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, and ensuring you get enough sleep. These factors can significantly impact your overall mental well-being! You can also try this activity to practice being kind to yourself: Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Your Mental Health | mindline.sg

Thanks for sharing about what has been bothering you. Believe it or not, I was in a similar state of being unmotivated yet feeling like I should be doing so many things. It was overwhelming for me personally and I could only guess the same for you.
Do you have a list of the things that you want to learn? What I found helpful last year was trying to categorise those things according to their difficulty and my interest level. After doing that I’ll first start on something that’s relatively easy yet fun for myself. This would help to kill 2 birds with 1 stone as you get to learn something new from your list while enjoying the process! Perhaps you could give it a try and see if there’s something on your list that falls into that category!
Otherwise, it is totally okay to not do anything as well. Maybe it is your body telling you that you needed rest on your break from school.

I truly appreciate the realness! I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling unmotivated, lost and even stressed… But I want to assure you that what you’re experiencing is not uncommon, and many people go through phases where they feel a mix of motivation and lack of focus or purpose. It’s like your mind is in a state of flux, and it’s okay to feel lost and confused during such times.
When you feel unmotivated yet inspired, it can sometimes be a sign that you have aspirations or goals that you’re passionate about, but something may be blocking your ability to pursue them fully. It might be helpful to explore these feelings and understand what might be causing this inner conflict. One of the ways you can explore the feelings is through journaling – ask yourself questions such as “Where is this feeling coming from? Was there something that triggered this stuckness? When was the last time I felt this way? How did I overcome the last situation?”
Another way you can process these emotions is when you reach out to a mental health professional who can guide you through step by step- working through the thoughts and feelings and helping you find the root issue. There’s really no shame in seeking support when we need to!
Please also remember to prioritize your self-care! It’s so important for us to eat and move well, because these are the basic blocks of life that sustains us.
Meanwhile, I would like to share some tools and strategies that you can try out whenever you’re feeling unmotivated or lost, and I hope these will help alleviate the stress a little!

I want to let you know that your experiences and emotions are all valid – I personally would feel the same way too if I were you. It’s actually quite common for people working in the social service sector to find it challenging to apply the same advice they offer to their clients to themselves. It’s important to remember that you, too, are human, and everyone has their own unique journey when it comes to understanding and processing their emotions.
I want to commend you firstly; your awareness of your difficulty in connecting with your feelings and your preference for keeping them to yourself is an important first step! It’s also noteworthy that when you do connect with your emotions, you experience strong reactions, such as getting teary and having difficulty functioning. It could be possible that these reactions indicate an underlying emotional challenges or perhaps you may have some unresolved issues.
While I can’t diagnose you (and neither is this platform appropriate for any kind of assessment or diagnosis), it’s possible that your experiences could be related to various factors, including past experiences, trauma, or mental health concerns. It’s true that our childhood experiences and past relationships can influence how we relate to and express our emotions even through till adulthood.
I think it’s important that you seek support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor – this could benefit you tremendously. As you would likely know, therapy can help you explore your feelings, understand the underlying causes of your emotional reactions, and develop healthier ways of coping and processing your emotions.
Meanwhile, I would also encourage you to try out these exercises and activities to help you remain grounded, especially when you feel overwhelmed by the mixed emotions:

This can also enhance your ability to support your clients more effectively by providing you with insights and tools to better understand and connect with their experiences.

It’s tough when you feel like the people around you are echoing these phrases and you’re not sure how to navigate the situation.
It’s tough to deal with gossip, but don’t let it consume you. Focus on your work and your goals. People often gossip when they’re unsure or misinformed, so show them through your actions who you really are.
But of course, if you’re truly feeling unhappy with the leadership and the team, consider looking for opportunities that align more closely with your expectations. Sometimes a change in environment can make a world of difference. It might take time and patience, but there’s often a way to make things better. Keep pushing forward!",,0,,,,,

3. Reflect on your goals and career aspirations. Do you see this current situation aligning with your long-term objectives, or do you think it might be hindering your professional growth?

It sounds like you’re navigating a complex and challenging work environment, and I can imagine how frustrating and confusing it must be too. I just want to assure you that it’s normal to experience a range of emotions and conflicts in the workplace, especially when you’ve gone through team changes and encountered gossip about yourself.
I feel that the advice you’ve received from your colleagues about not being too hard on yourself and the importance of self-change rather than trying to change others, contains some wisdom. I think that self-compassion is a valuable tool, and it’s important for us to recognize that we all have our strengths and areas for growth. It’s also true that you can’t control the actions and behaviors of others, but the good thing is… you can control how you respond to them
I can tell that you have strong convictions about your standards and expectations, which can be a positive trait. However, it’s also important to find a balance between holding high standards and working effectively with your leaders and colleagues. If a person is constantly defying leaders, it may lead to conflicts and misunderstandings, which can negatively impact the person’s work relationships and the overall team dynamics.
If you believe that your leaders are not meeting your expectations, it can be helpful to consider constructive ways to address this concern. Open and respectful communication can often lead to positive changes within a team. You might consider having a candid but respectful conversation with your leaders to express your concerns and suggest possible improvements.
Additionally, if you’re feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about how to navigate these challenges, you may benefit from seeking guidance and support from a career counselor or therapist. They can provide you with strategies for effective communication, conflict resolution, and managing workplace stress.
Meanwhile, here are some helpful tools that you can try to keep yourself calm and emotionally regulated:

Sure, we all have our insecurities and moments of self-doubt, but when self-hate becomes a constant thing, it’s definitely not something to brush off as “normal.”
First things first, it’s important to recognize that your feelings are valid. So, kudos to you for speaking up about it. It takes a lot of courage to admit these things.
Do you talk to yourself a lot? Catch yourself when you start those negative thoughts. Try flipping them around and giving yourself credit where it’s due. It might feel weird at first, but it can make a difference. Self-acceptance doesn’t mean you have to love every aspect of yourself immediately.

4728,I really am stuck,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-really-am-stuck/4728,Seeking Help,---,3782,Hanah123,User,,6739,1,"I was quite happy 4 years ago before Covid but now I’m ireally the unhappiest I have ever been, I have no friends no one to open up to, talk to, turn to. My mother is verbally abusive kind of person she has slapped me a few times but I don’t if that is ok because it was not like other parents, disciplining their child it was just if I annoyed her, or continued speaking when she was quite angry. My mother and sister get incredibly angry at the smallest things, for example if I accidentally took my sisters food instead of mine she would yell at me very loudly and scare me but I didn’t even do it on purpose. Like I said my mom hurts people most with her disgusting words, she has told me and my sister many times to die and called us ‘btches’ she has even said stuff like that to our father who has slapped her a few times when he’s very angry, however he has not slapped me, I’m not totally sure if he has slapped my sister because she does go against what my parents tell her so he might have but my father only slaps to discipline unlike my mother. Me and my father are the ‘Volcano’ type of people we take it and take it until we burst, my sister and mother however are the kind of people who will explode within seconds. Before Covid however, our family barely talked, busy with school and work and friends. During covid however, our maid ran away as my mother used to scold her a lot and having been scolded by mother before, I understand why she did, but that left our house in complete chaos. Me and my sister had to start doing all the work as my mother has arthritis and is overweight so it is hard for her to move around a lot. My father had work so he could not help us out. Because of being stuck and having to do work, me and my sister fought constantly, “I did all the work while you lazed around” ‘what all work you did, you did like three things!’ It became a fight for instant gratification, which was never given (thanks mom for making us do all the work when we have school work to do and then never so much acknowledging it and instead calling us lazy btches ). Even before Covid, I’m the younger sister and my older sister has always been lazy, has always made me do things for her while constantly bullying me. ‘Get me a glass of water’ ‘turn off the lights you’re closer’ ‘throw this in the trash for me’ ‘bring my food in for me’ ‘put my plates back in the sink’ etc. and this might seem like normal sister stuff, but it was constant and daily and sadly it carried on to Covid where she would be lazy give me more or harder work to do and then constantly claim to do more work then me to look better in front of my mother. Ok so that was the Covid years, I’m going to summarize the rest of the negative ramifications from Covid years- my mother and sister destroyed my confidence, self worth etc. -I became lonely and without friends or confidence to make new ones (thanks Covid) became completely alone with all my pain. Now this is going to cover an incredibly painful event towards the end of the Covid years for me and entering the worst period of my life . last year, in December, my family and I were going to India. My father had work and sister had school. Me and my mother and maid went first ( I wish I had a choice to say no because this literally caused the death of my happiness) my mother shops a lot and even in SG goes out every day and spends money like crazy (another problem I have my parents always stifled sister and me from money so my sister spends her paycheck the moment she gets them and I struggle to make sure I never become like them) my mother made me go out EVERYDAY FROM MORNING TO NIGHT IN HOT DIRTY INDIA JUST SO I COULD CARRY HER BAGS WHICH MY FATHER NORMALLY DOES. this is the part that always makes me cry, because we were always out the whole day, we had to eat outside, if you didn’t know, India is not know for having the cleanest kitchens, they have roadside stands with rats everywhere and even the restaurants are really dirty, so naturally I got a stomach infection. This actually hurts me to write, my mother… the first day I was sick, I ate then vomited, ate then vomited, then finally decided to eat something that was considered sick food (I ate some thing with milk),biggest mistake in my life because after not having any food in your body, and you vomit for the third time, you become so weak you can t even walk or move or do anything, I told my mother that i vomited for the third time, and that I couldn’t even move, and she booked a doctors appointment from somebody across the street to where we were staying at that did not have a PHD but learned everything from their parent, since I couldn’t even move, my mother made something f*caking stupid like a home remedy she mixed ginger and lemon juice and forced it down my throat, I was so weak that I couldn’t even say no. We took the lift to level one they were practically carrying me arms linked through mine and just before we crossed the street to get to the doctor, i vomited on the street, the stupid ginger lemon thing and I swear to god that woman that claims to be my mother screamed at me to stop vomiting ( I’m in actual tears right now , this was the worst moment in my entire life) imagine vomiting so much that you are so weak you can’t walk on your own, your mother feeds you a vomiting juice, and then screams at you in full volume in middle of the street in front so many people to ‘stop vomiting’ AS IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PHYSICALLY CONTROL, I NEVER HATED MY MOTHER MORE IN MY LIFE I NEVER WANTED TO DIE MORE IN MY LIFE THAN RIGTH THEN AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. I had to go to a hospital to be inserted with an IV because I could eat anything oh and btw that fake doctor told me that I was that sick because of mixing the ACNE PILL THAT MY MOTHER FORCED ME TO TAKE WITH MY STOMACH INFECTION MEDICINE. ACNE AS IF THAT IS A LIFE THREATENING DISEASE I GENUINELY DONT CARE HOW I LOOK AND MY MOTHER WILL NEVER MAKE INSECURE BUT BECAUSE SHE DIDNT WANT ME TO BE RIDICULED BY HER FRIENDS (whose opinion of me doesn’t matter to me at all)SHE MADE ME TAKE ACNE MEDICINE WHEN MY ACNE IS TEN TIMES BETTER THAN MY SISTERS AND TO ME THAT IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO LITERALLY KILL YOUR DAUGHTER + THE LEMON GONGER that literally means that my mother made me sick in the first place and then made vomit again and the screamed at me to stop as if I could control it as if it was my fault and not hers. During that trip, I was completely exhausted from carrying heavy bags and going out every day, I used to cry into my pillow wishing on all the stars that my father would be there to help me and let me rest, then when I got sick, my mother immediately wanted her bag carrier back thankfully she let me rest for a while ( very reluctantly, even thought she was the one to make sick and take me to the hospital) I have never met an more narcissistic stuck in her own point of view egotistic arrogant void of empathy person than my mother except for my sister. I cried everyday for my father and that I could be home. The second worst bit was once my father, sister got here, they said they had to leave earlier and offered me to go with them( I should have gone but then again emotionally manipulative mother to the rescue) she said stuff like (in tears, “you will leave me and go?” I swear to god I should have just point blank said yes because that monster kept me in my personal hell until January 1, THATS RIGHT FOLKS THAT SELFISH MONSTER KEPT ME IN THE WORST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD UNTILL TWO DAYS BEFORE MY SEC 4 YEAR!! LETS ALL CLAP FOR HER WHAT A MOTHER. Another thing that happened in India, all my relatives hate me, not exaggerating genuinely nobody cares if I lived or died, they fawn over my sister and then don’t so much as glance at me because I have darker skin that’s her, am younger than her, and am not as fluent as her. My mothers brother is just as bad as her. He used to comment something about me everyday, while expressing his immense love for my sister. So after all that negativity finally getting home and having homework to do immediately because school started in 2 days and i didn’t have any of my books with me in India, even though I asked my sister to bring it with her since she came to India after me. Awful start to worst year in my life. O-levels. Hatred in this year ran high. It was the number one feeling along with sadness, anger, hopelessness,worthlessness and of course depression.",,1,6796.0,,,,

I am really so sorry that you’re experiencing so much pain with your mother, especially the things that happened while you were in India. I’m truly sorry that you had to go through all the physical and emotional struggles. I just want to affirm you for your mental and emotional strength, that despite going through all these, you are still here - which proves to me that you’re really, really strong and brave. I commend you for that bravery and courage.
I’m so sorry that you had to start the year in such a way, it must have been very difficult for you. Sometimes, when we have difficulties with our families, it’s hard to have their understanding. They may not be able to fully empathise with us or understand what we are going through, and that is why I feel it’s important to seek support from the people around you such as your teachers, counsellors, or even trusted friends. It’s important for you to share your feelings and thoughts with someone who can also help you feel emotionally safe as well.
On another thought, I just want to share this resource that will be helpful for you whenever you feel the need to break away from the mixture of emotions as I understand that your O-level examinations are coming up. You can try detaching mindfully (https://mindline.sg/youth/resource-group?group=health-and-wellness&sub-group=my-feelings ) and remembering the positive things in your life, to help you to stay focused on your tasks ahead.
Meanwhile, it would really be good for you to speak to a mental health professional who can perhaps help you with strategies on coping with your family (e.g. communication skills) or the professional can also talk to your family members and mediate between members too.
I hope you will continue to focus on taking care of yourself too!

I do have a group of close friends but they are all in different schools and classes and take different subjects and we don’t get see each other as often anymore. I don’t really have any other friends outside of that group and am struggling with making more friends. Any tips on that? Because I have googled like online ‘how to make friends’ and they suggest to go out more and be more outspoken but it’s really hard for me to do that as I can’t go anywhere and it is very hard for me to be more outspoken or confident. That’s actually why I am struggling with loneliness as I only have 4-5 friends and we can’t see each other that much, and I feel very alone in my home with my sister and mother being so easily aggravated I have to very carefully assess each word before I say it in front of them just avoid a fight. I am getting very tired of walking on egg shells around them, I wish I could just not have them in my life anymore. I’m also starting to resent my friends as they have no initiative to meet anymore as they have their own group of friends, and I find out things about them that I don’t Like, I tried to open up to my sister and my friend and they both shut me down and change the topic and so now I don’t trust them and even resent them. I also found out that my guy friends have more traditional views and are very combative whenever I point out that they shouldn’t think like that anymore. So it’s really hard for me to go about everyday completely alone, and failing in my studies. So I feel so hopeless like no one is ever going to love me. I am going to fail and go nowhere, do nothing with my life, I’m a failure. To me success means nothing to me without love and support, like if I pass an exam I will be even happier when people around me hug and congratulate me. So I feel like there’s no point in me passing as nobody will care, my parents no matter how well you do, they will still be disappointed you didn’t do better. So not only do I feel hopeless in my studies but I also feel hopeless in the thought I will forever be alone and no one will love or care about me.",,1,,,,,

The best opportunities to make friends in my opinion is during transitions where everyone is starting off from the same line. As you finish your secondary school education and move to a tertiary institution, there will be many opportunities to “start anew” and make friends. You don’t have to be outspoken to make friends, there’s value in being authentic and being yourself.

I am really so sorry to hear that you’ve been feeling alone recently and that you’ve been crying so much. You’ve gone through alot, and yet you’re still here, trying to figure things out and seeking support - I commend you for being so brave and so resilient!
I hear you - your family doesn’t feel like family for now. It’s really painful to experience this falling-apart between each member, and I’m really sorry to hear about this. Sometimes, families have conflict and struggles that might be difficult to manage for the time being - but don’t give up. You have more resilience in you than you think.
For starters, perhaps it would be good to manage your exam stress - because if you feel too stressed by your exams, it would be difficult to manage anything else on your plate. Some ways to manage your exam stress can be doing deep breathing exercises (https://mindline.sg/youth/resource-group?group=health-and-wellness&sub-group=self-care ) and focusing on your breath while calming down. This can be so beneficial for us when we feel angry or overwhelmed by our surroundings. Give it a try and let me know how it goes!
Secondly, try to seek support from your friends around you or your teachers or school counsellor. I feel that it’s important for you to share your feelings honestly and openly in a safe environment, and not to bottle things up. When you can share your feelings, you’ll be able to slowly figure out strategies together and help you untangle your home situation together. Perhaps, the school counselor can even help to speak to your family as a whole and work on the family situation too. It could also be helpful for you to practice acceptance (read more here: https://mindline.sg/youth/article?type=resource&resource-id=459) and help yourself to manage your expectations of your family members.
Last but not least, do try to prioritize self-care in the tiniest ways - even if it means eating something that makes you happy, or drawing little doodles on your paper to help you relief some stress. Find little rainbows in your life, and focus on the positives
Again, I really commend you for your resilience and bravery and I just want to remind you that this community is here for you",https://mindline.sg/youth/resource-group?group=health-and-wellness&sub-group=self-care 1 https://mindline.sg/youth/resource-group?group=health-and-wellness&sub-group=self-care; https://mindline.sg/youth/article?type=resource&resource-id=459 https://mindline.sg/youth/article?type=resource&resource-id=459,2,,6742,,6742.0,

I felt very confused as to what exactly I was feeling as I felt a very weird mixture of anger/frustration, sadness, stress. It was a weird situation of me wanting to cry but not being able to and for some reason, ended up in a process of crying for less than a minute, stopping, and then going again. I think that happened 3 times.

I’m so sorry to hear that you’ve been struggling with your sleep, and that you’ve been crying so much recently. I hear you, it does sound like you’re experiencing a mix of emotions and you’re not sure what’s happening - and it feels like you can’t pinpoint to a particular reason. I want to affirm you that your feelings are all valid - the confusion, stress, anger, sadness, even the weirdness. They are all valid! And it’s perfectly okay to feel a mix of all these emotions altogether at the same time. I also want to encourage you that it’s totally okay to cry. Crying is one of the many ways that we express our emotions (even if we don’t know what they are), and it’s okay to cry
Sometimes stress can show up in different ways - sometimes we cry, sometimes we feel sick, and sometimes we just don’t know what to do. I’m glad that you’re able to recognise this bag of emotions because it shows that you have a good sense of self-awareness! I encourage you to take it a step further by journaling down your emotions and try to reflect on some questions (e.g. what is causing me to feel this way?) to uncover more about those feelings.
It could also be the exam stress, and perhaps you could try out some mindfulness strategies to calm yourself down whenever you feel anxious or stressed. Here are some wonderful examples that you can try out that might help : https://mindline.sg/online-chatbot/self-care-exercises?category=mindfulness-practice
Most importantly, please do focus on taking care of yourself! Self-care is a basic (but very important!) building block of our lives You can try your best to have balanced meals and engaging in activities that will help you unwind and relax.
I hope you’ll find a way to relief the stress somehow, but please know that this community is here for you too.",https://mindline.sg/online-chatbot/self-care-exercises?category=mindfulness-practice 6 https://mindline.sg/online-chatbot/self-care-exercises?category=mindfulness-practice,5,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts, I commend you for your bravery and courage to be open here. I’m really sorry to hear this, it does sound like you’re having some difficulties with your relationship with your father and being at home seems to be stressful for you. Sometimes, dealing with a parent’s anger and feeling like you can’t be yourself can be incredibly challenging.
I’m not sure if you are keen to try these, but I do have some ideas in mind that can possibly help! Perhaps you could try talking to him and having an open conversation - sometimes parents just need to hear how we truly feel. You can try using more “I” statements, like “I feel really stressed when…” and try to help him understand your perspective.
However, I do understand that sometimes parents might not be open to talking about how they made you feel, so it would also be good for you to speak to a trusted friend or adult - just to share your feelings and thoughts so that you don’t bottle everything up inside. It’s important for us to have an outlet to share our feelings honestly. Sometimes we can do it through drawings, or painting, or even through exercising or taking a short jog - all these strategies can help us to relief the stress and pressure that might build up inside of us!
And I want to affirm you, it’s completely okay to cry! Crying is another way to express ourselves, and you’re right - it’s a way to de-stress too.
I would also encourage you to seek professional help so that you can cry openly and also share your innermost feelings and thoughts, and the best part - you can discover more ways to manage those difficult moments, such as strategies or communication skills!
It is so important for you to prioritize your mental health - even if it means crying it out Please remember that your feelings are important and valid too. So don’t be afraid to reach out for further support!",,2,,,,,

It’s scary, and I’m too scared to reach out to anyone. I want to be myself again, but it doesn’t seem possible after these few months.

At night, I get super stressed out of nowhere and have these random attacks which suffocate me, make me cry and drool. When I cry, a drool a lot, and that’s another thing I’m worried about. The world would spin, and I may sometimes get nosebleeds either from crying for hours or just a LOT of stress.
The attacks got even worse after an incident that included my ex-friend and I. She reported me to the teacher, apparently because I had grabbed her waist. Her excuse was that I was a homo. I was asked to talk to the school counsellor, and the counsellor had started talking about sensitive topics. Most likely to find out why I was this way. She asked about primary school past, which was an extremely sensitive topic to me. I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I had a breakdown.
When I went home that day, my parents asked what happened. I stormed into my room without answering, feeling another attack coming. That was the worst one I’ve ever had, crying, screaming, drooling, coughing, rolling around on my bedroom floor and ripping apart the gifts my ex-friends had given me back in primary school.
Ever since then, my attacks have been frequenting me on most nights.
I’m scared, and I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this. If I told my parents, I’m scared it would burden them, because I know it’s hard enough having a kid that’s not like others.

I’m really sorry to hear that you’re experiencing such distressing symptoms. It must be really confusing and frustrating at the same time. However, I’m really proud of you for taking the step forward to ask for help here! It’s the first and most important step for you right now. Thank you for sharing honestly about your addiction to the electronics, it takes a lot of courage to admit this. It does sound like you’re experiencing anxiety for some reason and it would be good for you to speak to a mental health professional to get more help on managing this. For the time being, here are some steps you can try to help yourself manage it meanwhile:
2. Try and talk to someone! It could be a friend, a trusted adult, or even a mental health professional. Sharing your feelings and experiences can be a relief and the first step towards getting the help you need.
3. Practice Relaxation Techniques! There are actually many ways to relax, but picking up specific relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help you manage anxiety and stress specifically. These techniques can be especially helpful if you’re waking up hyperventilating and feeling suffocated. There are many videos on Youtube that has instructions on how to do so!
4. Try your best to replace electronic use with some other activity. It’s common for people to turn to electronics as a form of distraction or escapism when dealing with stress and anxiety, but excessive use of electronics, especially before bedtime, can disrupt sleep patterns and exacerbate anxiety. Perhaps you could consider setting boundaries on your electronic device usage, particularly in the evening. Or you could replace the use of electronics with something else such as taking a walk, or drawing!
5. Dig deeper! If you feel the sudden urge to use your electronic, you could ask yourself - Am I feeling anxious now? What is causing me to feel this way? We can find out many things about ourselves when we actually sit and observe and ask ourselves questions
Most importantly @minh, please don’t ever feel like you’re alone in this - you’re not! We’re all here to support you and there are many, many resources available for you to tap on. When you’re ready, please do speak to a mental health professional such as your school counsellor, to share about these symptoms and talk more about how to manage the root issues.

To encourage you, I really think it would be good for you to share your troubles with your parents even though you’re worried about their response. You could have an honest conversation with them and tell them that you’re not sure what to do, or perhaps they can support you to seek help from a mental health professional too. It would benefit you to reach out for further emotional support because it does sound like you’re having a really hard time. When you reach out for help, you would be able to learn many new ways to regulate your emotions, share further about your anxieties, find strategies to manage, and much more! We all need a helping hand, and I encourage you to speak to a professional soon.
Meanwhile, it would be good for you to try the below techniques or strategies that can help you tide through those moments for the timebeing:
- Breathing techniques or grounding techniques (can watch them on youtube with instructions!)
- Journaling your thoughts and feelings

Thank you for reaching out and sharing something so personal with us.
Firstly, I want to acknowledge the complexity of the situation you’re facing and the emotions it must be bringing up for you. It’s completely understandable that receiving an invitation to an event at a venue and on a date that triggers painful memories can create a lot of uncertainty and discomfort.
In deciding whether to attend the event, it’s important to consider both your emotional well-being and your professional responsibilities. Here are a few factors to think about:
2. Emotional well-being: Reflect on how attending the event might impact your emotional state. If being at the venue and on the same date could potentially reopen wounds and cause significant distress, it’s essential to prioritise your mental health. It’s okay to acknowledge that some triggers might be too overwhelming to manage, and it’s important to respect your own boundaries.
3. Professional considerations: While work and personal life are distinct, there can be instances where they intersect. Considering the micromanagement tendencies within your work environment, I can imagine why you would be concerned about potential repercussions or perceptions should you decide not to attend the event. In situations like these, open communication is key. I would encourage you to try communicating your concerns with your supervisor or HR department if you’re worried about potential misunderstandings or repercussions. Openly expressing your discomfort and reasons for not attending can provide context and prevent unnecessary assumptions.
4. Explore alternatives: If attending the event feels too challenging, consider exploring alternatives. Is there a possibility of participating in a different way, such as virtually, or perhaps contributing to the event’s planning in a behind-the-scenes capacity?
5. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings and concerns. Sometimes, discussing your emotions with someone who understands your situation can provide valuable insights and emotional support.
Ultimately, the decision is deeply personal and should be guided by what feels right for you. It’s important to prioritise your well-being and consider what would best support your emotional health while also navigating your professional responsibilities. Remember, your emotions and reactions are valid, and taking steps to protect your mental health is a sign of self-care and self-awareness.

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concern about how to respond when encountering someone who might be experiencing hallucinations. It’s evident that you genuinely care about the well-being of others and want to approach such situations with empathy and understanding. It’s truly commendable that you want to be supportive and make a positive difference in such situations.
Hallucinations and delusions are experiences that can occur in various mental health conditions, most commonly in disorders like schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and sometimes in severe episodes of bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder. Here’s a bit more information regarding these experiences:
Hallucinations: Hallucinations involve perceiving things that aren’t present in reality. These sensory experiences can involve seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, or tasting things that others don’t. For instance, someone might hear voices or see objects that others cannot perceive. These experiences can be distressing and sometimes frightening.
Delusions: Delusions are strongly held beliefs that are not based in reality. They might involve beliefs that seem bizarre or impossible to others, such as believing one has special powers, is being controlled by external forces, or has a unique mission. Delusions can significantly impact a person’s thinking and behavior.
Here are some steps to consider if you encounter someone who appears to be experiencing hallucinations or delusions:
2. Stay Calm and Non-Judgmental : Approach the situation with a calm and non-judgmental demeanor. Remember that the person’s experiences are very real to them, even if they might seem unusual to others. While you should not pretend that you also experience the hallucination, you should also avoid trying to convince the person that the hallucination does not exist. You may instead ask questions like, “Are you hearing voices other than mine? What are they telling you?”. The immediate goal of your response should be to help the person focus on reality rather than the hallucination. Gently instruct the person to look at you, rather than whatever else they are seeing.
3. Ensure Safety: If the person’s behavior seems risky (e.g., wandering into traffic), prioritise their safety and gently guide them away from potential harm. Reassure the person gently that you want to help them, and explain who you are, what you are doing and why. Helping the person to understand what is going on can reduce their stress and confusion (the contrary may result in an increase in hallucinations).
4. Respect Personal Space: Approach the person at a respectful distance, avoiding any sudden movements that might startle them. Avoid touching the person without their permission. If delusions are present, it is important to keep yourself safe from potentially violent reactions, until you know the content and context of the delusions.
5. Use Gentle and Reassuring Language: Speak softly and reassuringly. Use simple and clear language to communicate. At times, whispering and laughing may be misunderstood by the person, especially if they are experiencing paranoid delusions, so you would want to be mindful of this as well.
6. Listen, Validate and Avoid Arguing : If the person is comfortable sharing their experiences, listen actively and validate their feelings without confirming or denying the reality of their hallucinations or delusions. Generally, it’s not productive to argue with someone about the validity of their experiences. Instead, focus on their emotions and well-being. For example, if they have a strong belief that their water has been poisoned, connect with the emotion underlying the delusion or hallucination – you could say something like “It must be really frightening to believe that all your water has been poisoned”.
7. Offer Assistance : If the person is open to it, ask if they need any assistance or support. Be prepared to respect their wishes if they decline. If possible, you could ask the person if they would like you to guide them to a quiet and less stimulating environment where they may feel more at ease, for example.
8. Emergency Help: If the person’s safety is at risk, and they’re unable to communicate or respond, consider calling emergency services for professional intervention.
Remember that while your intention to help is admirable, it’s important to prioritise your safety and comfort as well. If you’re unsure how to proceed or if the situation escalates, seeking assistance from mental health professionals or authorities is a responsible course of action.
Educating yourself further about mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and related disorders, can also provide you with valuable insights and strategies for supporting individuals who might be experiencing hallucinations or delusions. You could read more on psychosis here .
Thank you for your compassion and willingness to support others. Your efforts to approach these situations with empathy can make a positive difference in someone’s day.

4261,Please help with my anxiety,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/please-help-with-my-anxiety/4261,Is This Normal?,---,2737,rrrrr,User,,5865,1,"I have been dealing with anxiety for a while now. I have been diagnose with a form of covid related anxiety due to the difficulty I had breathing. So, my psychiatrists says these episodes will go away after sometime, but I think they got worse. Every since I had my first psychiatrist visit, which was about 2 months ago, I had panic attacks almost every single day. I could only take the medication given every 3 days, which was about how often these episodes came before I visit the psychiatrist. These panic attacks were due to same symptoms I had experience prior to my hospital visit, so I was used to it, trying convincing myself everyday that it was just anxiety. However, these past two weeks had been really difficult. I had a tingling and burning sensation in my right heel that had been going on for about 2 weeks. I had trouble falling asleep, waking up immediately after I fall asleep feeling like I can’t breath. Furthermore, I’ve had shooting pains down my left back area, as well as tremors at my left chest area, all of which are making me freak out because I had never experienced any of it. I couldn’t resist the urge to google these symptoms, even though I know it will make me freak out more, but I can’t help but worry. This week was by far the worse. I had difficulties swallowing. I choked on my food because of it and ever since then I only tried to eat in small amounts and drink liquid. It was almost as if I forgot how to swallow and I am very scared that the food I ate was going to go up my nose or my windpipe. I felt almost crazy that i had to manually count the seconds the food I ate was going down my throat before I breath again. Moreover, I had sharp pains and a burning sensation in my stomach area, which is most likely due to acid reflux because I do have that. I feel like a clean freak, I am constantly washing my hands, going from my bedroom to the toilet at least 5 times every night before I go to bed. Things I never used to afraid of, like using a wet wipe, made me wash my hands because I was afraid that the soap in a wet wipe was going to poison me if I had eaten food with the unwashed hands. I am constantly checking my body fluids, urine, ensuring if there wasn’t any discolouration and if there was, that I had a serious medical illness. This wasn’t possible because I had gone the the emergency department 4 months prior and gotten everything cleared. I was healthy. Even now, I try to get better with workouts, exercising, playing the sport I loved so much before. Yet I am unable to get these thoughts and bodily sensations out out of my head. So, I really want to ask if, should I get these symptoms checked out again? Since I already went to the ER prior and got all tests done, ruling out any possibility of serious problems. But at the same time, I feel like I should because all these symptoms are new. Moreover, I am wondering if I really just have a covid related anxiety thats a side effect, because I believe its something much more than that, since I’ve tried many things to reduce my anxiety and stress, but nothing is really helping.",,2,,,,,

It takes a lot of courage to share your experiences, and I want you to know that I’m here to provide support and understanding.
First, I want to emphasize that seeking help and support is essential in situations like this. While your psychiatrist mentioned that the episodes might go away with time, it seems like your symptoms have worsened and are significantly impacting your daily life. It’s crucial to follow up with a healthcare professional, such as your psychiatrist or a primary care doctor, to discuss your current symptoms and concerns.
It’s also important to address your anxiety and how it’s affecting your life. Anxiety can manifest in various ways and may require a comprehensive approach for management. Alongside medical evaluations, counselling and therapy can be beneficial in helping you cope with anxiety and stress.
Here are some exercises from Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) that you might find helpful when the symptoms show up.
2. Symptom: Difficulty Swallowing: When you experience difficulty swallowing and start feeling anxious, try using the Grounding Technique. Focus on your senses by looking around the room and naming five things you see, then touch and describe four objects around you. This exercise can help distract your mind from anxious thoughts and bring you back to the present moment, reducing distress.
3. Symptom: Tingling and Burning Sensation in Right Heel: If you notice tingling and burning sensations in your heel and start to worry about its cause, you can practice Opposite Action. Instead of avoiding physical activities or assuming the worst, engage in gentle stretching exercises or walk around for a few minutes. This can help counteract the urge to withdraw and may lessen anxiety.
4. Symptom: Sharp Pains and Burning Sensation in Stomach: If you suspect acid reflux is causing discomfort and it triggers anxiety, you can try the Self-Soothe exercise. Have a warm cup of herbal tea or take a few minutes to engage in deep belly breathing to soothe your stomach and calm your mind.
Anxiety can exacerbate physical sensations, leading to a heightened state of worry and distress. These symptoms and anxieties can create a cycle where one feeds into the other, making the overall experience more challenging.
Incorporating the DBT exercises when these symptoms arise can help interrupt this cycle and offer you some relief. Tolerating distress is a crucial aspect of managing anxiety, as it allows you to develop the capacity to stay with difficult emotions without becoming overwhelmed. By applying distress tolerance skills like Grounding, Self-Soothing, and Mindfulness, you can bring down the intensity of distress and create a space for emotional regulation.
When you practice distress tolerance, you are essentially giving yourself permission to experience the distress without judgment or attempts to immediately fix it. This process of acceptance can be challenging at first, but over time, it can lead to a reduction in the overall distress and anxiety you experience.
Once you have created some space to tolerate distress, you can then focus on emotional regulation techniques. Emotional regulation involves learning to identify and understand your emotions and finding healthy ways to manage and express them.
However, it’s essential to remember that these exercises are just tools, and professional help is crucial in addressing the root causes of your anxiety and providing comprehensive support. Take care, and know that you have the strength within you to face these challenges and grow through them.

We’d firstly like to apologise for the delay in our response and hope that you’ve been keeping well.
Thank you for reaching out and sharing your feelings and concerns with us. It takes a lot of courage to seek insight and understanding about your emotions and experiences, and I’d like to commend you for that.
Feeling tired and lacking motivation can be really unpleasant, and it’s important to explore the underlying reasons for these changes. While I don’t have enough information to diagnose, what you’re describing could be indicative of depression, especially when it affects your appetite, motivation, and overall well-being.
Depression is a complex mental health condition that can manifest in various ways, including changes in energy levels, sleeping patterns, and appetite. It’s not uncommon for individuals to experience depression during school holidays or times of increased stress or transition.
However, if you’ve noticed these changes persisting, I would urge you to seek professional support to gain a clearer understanding of what you’re going through. Talking to a mental health professional can help you explore your thoughts and emotions in-depth and determine whether depression or other factors are contributing to your current experiences.
In the meantime, consider implementing self-care practices that can support your well-being, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, engaging in physical activity, connecting with supportive friends or family members, and seeking activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Perhaps you’d like to try creating your own little bit of routine during the school holidays - something as small as waking up at a regular time everyday and starting your day with a cup of your favourite beverage, for example, could give you that little bit of motivational boost to start your day.
Lastly, I’d like to remind you that you don’t have to navigate this alone. Reaching out to a mental health professional can provide you with the guidance and support needed to address these feelings and find healthy coping strategies.
If you ever find yourself struggling or feeling overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to talk to someone you trust or consider reaching out to a mental health helpline for immediate support.

4197,Should I continue taking meds and see psychologist?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/should-i-continue-taking-meds-and-see-psychologist/4197,Mental Health Conditions,"mentalhealth, gethelp",194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),5778,2,"Dear @Tkii.ash7eyy,
Thank you for reaching out and sharing your struggles with us. I want you to know that our community is here to support you through this difficult time.
First and foremost, I’m truly sorry for the losses you’ve experienced—the passing of your dog, mom, and the challenges with your job. Grieving these losses and managing mental health concerns simultaneously can be incredibly overwhelming. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s essential to prioritise your well-being moving forward.
From what you’ve described, I’m hearing that you’ve been dealing with depression, anxiety, and traits of borderline personality disorder (BPD), in addition to struggles with alcohol. The fact that you’ve been clean from alcohol for once or twice a month is truly commendable progress, and I encourage you to continue working towards reducing alcohol use.
Regarding your mental health treatment, I’m hearing that your dad has advised you to stop receiving treatment since you’re starting on a new job. I’m wondering whether this is due to finances or perhaps the difficulties surrounding getting time off work for the appointments? Given the increase in the frequency of anxiety attacks and depressive episodes you’ve mentioned, I would strongly advise that you reconnect with a mental health professional as soon as possible. Seeking their guidance and support is crucial in managing your symptoms and finding healthier coping mechanisms for the episodes you’ve been experiencing. Reestablishing contact with your previous mental health providers or finding a new one who would understand your needs and concerns can be beneficial for your well-being.
In the meantime, here are some skills you can try to help manage your mental health:
2. Grounding Techniques: Practice grounding exercises to bring yourself back to the present moment when you feel overwhelmed. For example, you can focus on your breath, describe your surroundings out loud, or use grounding objects like stress balls. Here is a deep breathing exercise you could try.
3. Self-Compassion Practice: In difficult times, it is even more important to treat yourself with kindness and compassion. Try replacing self-critical thoughts with self-encouraging and supportive ones. We are often our own worst critics, so this is definitely a lot easier said than done. You could start by thinking about what you would say to a friend in a similar situation. You can read more on self-compassion here.
4. Journaling: It may sometimes be difficult to verbalise how we’re feeling, especially if, like you’ve mentioned, it feels like people are not really listening. An alternative is to try penning down your thoughts and emotions in a journal regularly. This can be quite cathartic, while also helping you gain insights into your feelings, identify triggers, and track your progress.
5. Create a Self-Care Routine: Set aside time for self-care activities that nurture your physical and emotional well-being. This can include regular exercise, hobbies you enjoy, spending time in nature, or creative pursuits like drawing or gaming.
Remember that it’s okay to ask for help and seek support. You don’t have to face these challenges alone. Reconnecting with mental health professionals and implementing these coping skills can be transformative in your journey towards healing and stability.

On one hand, I feel that they’re a danger to my friends and I. They call us their “friends” but they don’t treat us like such. I’m worried that they’re going to lash out more violently the next time they do and someone (close) is going to get injuries that are more than just abrasions. I want to cut them off so I can ensure the safety of all of my friends. On the other hand, I know they have family and mental issues, which I assume is what is making them break down like that. I feel terrible as no one deserves to feel that way. However, that does not excuse their behaviour. I also fear that, if we cut our friendship off, they will build up resentment and animosity towards us for it and come back sometime stronger and harder than before, seriously injuring us.",,1,,,,,
4226,Cut ‘Em Off?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/cut-em-off/4226,Seeking Help,---,61,JasonQ,User,Professional (Moderator),5799,2,"hey @JayHyjinx
I’m really sorry to hear about your difficult situation with your friend. It must be tough to deal with such conflicting feelings of care and concern for them while also being worried about their behaviour and its impact on your safety and the safety of others. It’s completely normal to feel this way, given the red flags you’ve noticed in their actions.
It’s important to prioritize your well-being and the well-being of your other friends. When someone’s behaviour starts affecting others negatively, it becomes necessary to seek help and support. You’ve already identified several red flags in your friend’s behaviour, such as expressing thoughts of self-harm and threatening others, which are serious concerns that should not be taken lightly.
I want you to know that seeking help from a trusted adult or authority figure, such as a school counsellor, teacher, or responsible family member, is right and appropriate in this situation. They can provide guidance and take appropriate action to address your friend’s concerning behaviour. You don’t have to handle this on your own.
Understandably, you might be worried about your friend’s mental health and personal issues, and that’s commendable to show empathy towards them. However, remember that you are not equipped to solve their problems or manage their emotions. Professional help is needed for your friend to address their issues safely and appropriately.
I also want to acknowledge the intrusive thoughts you’ve been experiencing. It’s completely normal to feel scared and anxious, given the circumstances you’re in. Reaching out to a mental health professional or counsellor can be beneficial for you to talk about your feelings, cope with your fears, and develop healthy ways to deal with this situation.
It’s important to remember that you are not responsible for your friend’s actions, and cutting off the friendship does not make you a bad person. Prioritizing your safety and that of your friends is essential, and seeking help is a brave and responsible choice.
Don’t hesitate to reach out for help, and know that you have the strength to navigate through this challenging situation. Take care of yourself, and remember that seeking assistance is a sign of strength, not weakness.
Lastly if you ever find yourself in immediate danger or unable to cope with these feelings, I urge you to seek help right away. Reach out to a mental health helpline such as SOS (1-767) or IMH (63892222) immediately. Both helplines are available 24/7. Your safety and well-being are essential, and I would like for you to know that there are resources available to support you through this difficult time.",,2,,5798,,5798.0,

From what I understand (I might be wrong):
2. Your records is private and confidential meaning conpanies will not be allowed to snoop through or even take a sneak peek your records (this is also cause of PDPA), their request will be denied because no one is allowed to access your records unless required by law or you want to work in law enforcement (because you’ll carry weapon).
3. Because of point 1, they won’t be able to find out if you sought help from mental health professionals. Personally, ultimaltely I feel that it’s up to you how much you want to declare about your mental health, no one should be “forced” to share than more than what one’s comfortable with.

It first started with being afraid of graduating as I wouldn’t get to see them anymore. The fear of losing someone is kinda normal, right? Now I start to feel extremely anxious whenever I don’t hang around the counselling area, or we can’t have our weekly session during school term due to schedule clashing, public holidays etc. I also start to have thoughts like what if they are resigning soon.
I don’t really mind not seeing them during school breaks, but I don’t think that makes the attachment any better. I am also not exactly dependent on them for advice either. I am just really attached to their presence (?) I suppose.
I don’t want to explore this topic with them because I am scared they might suggest things like taking a break from our sessions or switching counsellors.

Thank you for being so vulnerable and sharing this with us, sending you hugs . It is understandable why you would feel “attached” to your counsellor, especially if you, as mentioned don’t share or feel like others are as reliable. I’m glad to hear you feel safe around them and trust them a lot, but I also see that you recognize your fear of losing them is starting to bother you. You mentioned that you’re scared to explore this topic with them, so I’m curious:
2. How do you think they’ll react (you mentioned they might suggest taking a break - is that in line with their character so far from your sessions?)
3. What would you want out of asking them? (Do you want a “solution”, an explanation or just to get it out of your chest with them?)
Lastly, if you do decide you would rather not bring it up with them at all, what would you ideally want things to be different from how it is now? (Do you want to stop feeling attached and do you want to find out more why?)
To bring up a personal example, I felt quite attached to my counsellor of three years as well, and was devastated to hear when he had to leave. As devastated as I was, I also understood that I’ll be okay, and all the skills he taught me will stay with me forever. It’s been about a year since I’ve last seen him, and so far everything’s been okay . I know our situations may be different but I hope it helps bring you some comfort, please feel free to reply/ask/update us whenever you want to",,4,,4817,,4817.0,

Thank you for gathering the courage to be vulnerable with us. I’m hearing that you’ve developed an attachment to your counsellor over the course of your therapy sessions, and you’re feeling concerned about the impact of this attachment on your well-being. It’s natural to form a bond with someone who provides a safe space for vulnerability and support, especially when, like you mentioned, reliable figures are lacking in other areas of your life. I can imagine that it could be very unpleasant and frightening to picture losing that safe space someday in the future, especially when it’s something that you value greatly.
Here are a couple of suggestions on navigating this attachment in a healthy manner:
2. Acknowledge and validate your feelings.
Recognise that your attachment is a valid emotional response to the therapeutic relationship you have with your counsellor. It is okay to feel attached and to value their presence in your life. Allow yourself to firstly acknowledge and validate these feelings without judgment.
3. Reflect on the reasons behind the attachment.
Another thing you could do is to take some time to reflect on why you might be feeling so attached to your counsellor. Perhaps it could be the sense of safety they provide, like you’ve mentioned, as well as the potential gaps in reliable support figures in your life. Exploring these underlying factors and understanding the probable reasons behind your attachment can provide valuable insights into your emotional needs.
4. Explore additional support options.
If one of the key factors underlying the attachment is the lack of reliable support figures in other areas of your life, then it may also be in your best interest to explore additional support options in your life. This could include building connections with supportive friends or joining relevant support groups - in fact, perhaps the community on this forum could be a good place to start! Ultimately, we want to work on diversifying your support network so as to amplify the sense of security and reduce excessive dependence on one individual.
5. Share your concerns with your counsellor.
You may wish to consider discussing these concerns with your counsellor. While I hear you on fearing that they might suggest terminating therapy or switching counsellors, I’d like you to also bear in mind that they are trained Professionals who are likely to have encountered similar situations before. Openly sharing your thoughts and fears can help foster a deeper understanding of your relationship dynamics and allow you to work together towards maintaining healthy boundaries and finding ways to manage your attachment. Having this conversation may also provide an avenue for your counsellor to delve deeper into the attachment and explore any underlying emotional wounds or unresolved issues that may contribute to the intensity of the attachment.
6. Practise grounding techniques to help you focus on the present.
Grounding techniques are ways to manage anxiety and other uncomfortable symptoms by turning your attention away from thoughts and worries and refocusing on the present moment. Whenever you feel the sense of anxiety start to creep up on you, you could try the 5-4-3-2-1 technique by identifying 5 things you can see in your environment, 4 things you can feel e.g. the texture of the chair you’re sitting on, the sun on your skin, etc, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. Alternatively, you could try counting backwards from 100 or reciting the alphabets backwards. The idea is to take your mind off these anxiety-inducing thoughts and bring you back to the here and now. You can read more on these exercises here .
Hope this helps - please feel free to follow up with any questions you may have. If you do decide to broach the topic with your counsellor, you are most welcome to update us on how things go.
Wishing you all the best and take care!",here 3 https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/grounding-techniques,2,,,,,

Personally I’ve encountered a similar issue like you before where I felt too attached to my counsellor.
From my personal experience/ point of view, it really is beneficial for you to open up your thoughts and feelings to your counsellor.
I know it seems scary and the fear of your counsellor not wanting to be your counsellor anymore feels very real. But trust/have faith in your counsellor that s/he won’t leave you in a ditch.
Because frankly speaking, attachment is really a common issue because human connection is a very complicated subject to comprehend. Sometimes we just feel more attached to certain people especially when/even more so when it’s someone we feel comfortable enough to share our inner thoughts that we won’t share with anyone else.
The reason(s) why I encourage you to share your thoughts with your counsellor is because unfortunately the day will come where you will have to part ways with each other, be it s/he leaving (resigning) or you graduating. It doesn’t mean the relationship is over though because the memories will live on.
If your counsellor does know about what you’re feeling/your thoughts and fears, s/he will be able to better support you, helping you work through this issue at a comfortable pace by giving you the time and space to talk about this issue.
You and your Counselor could also work on building up skills to cope or helping you/working to find closure when the time comes…. If you keep to yourself/supress these feelings, it’ll just keep building up until it becomes too overwhelming…
Hope this is helpful/provide some assurances. I really wish you well and if you do open up to your counsellor and if you’re comfortable, do update us on how it goes! Take care!",,2,,,,,

He treats me well and etc. however his relationship with his elder sister weirds me out. Today my curiosity got the best of me and hence I decided to snoop through his telegram and WhatsApp chats on his laptop. I went straight to his messages with his elder sis. Apparently he said something completely different to her compared to what actually happened. He was the one who pursued me at the start but he made it seem like I wanted to pursue him to his elder sister. He could tell about his feelings for me to his second elder sis and his friends but he lied to the eldest throughout the convo. He also hid his profile pic (it was my face) from his elder sis. I had his face as my profile pic and she basically commented that I was weird for putting his face as my profile pic and that I’m insecure. He agreed with her and he said that I’m weird as well. His elder sis tried to break my boundary by invading my personal space a lot of time and not to mention that she was weirdly sarcastic with every short convo we had. (Like she barged into his room to see me when I didn’t want to see her , he had to carry her out. When I was leaving the house she ran up to talk to me and I was taken aback - this was our first meeting and she said am I mute for not responding. ) He created a group to talk to her about her invading my boundaries and in their personal chat she mentioned that I’m a fighter (sarcastic). I don’t understand why he didn’t reveal how he truly felt for me to his elder sis. I can speak up for myself yes but I think it would be weird speaking to her when I don’t have a close rs and I don’t understand why he can’t stick up for me. When one of his friend mentioned something about me he got mad and confronted him. But yah. Also like he mentions really detailed version of our personal sexual life to his friends. It seemed like he shared a lot about that and it made me feel uncomfortable. Why is that the only thing he could take about? Idk what else but I feel like the person that I chose to date was completely different from who I really thought he was. Thank you. Also I spoke to his second elder sis about this incident and did mention about my snooping as well which isn’t good but yep. I guess I’ll let this go with the flow or see what I can do about it? Also May I know what I can do to resolve this situation or like idk. I’m really confused",,2,,,,,

Seems about right when you described how she barged into the room and made you feel uncomfortable.
I personally think it’s probably a clash of personalities between you and his elder sis. Sometimes this can be mitigated over time as both of you start to know each other better but sometimes it doesn’t get better too. I’m not sure how much your boyfriend means to you but it seems like there are some trade offs if you continue being with him. Ultimately it’s whether you can accept these trade offs (eg his eldest sis always stepping on your toes).

Thank you for coming forward and sharing something so personal to you. The situation you’re faced with sounds pretty complex and I can imagine the struggle in trying to navigate a situation so delicate, especially when various parties are involved. I hear that this situation has left you feeling confused and perhaps uncertain about your relationship. It can be challenging to discover discrepancies in the way your boyfriend communicates with his elder sister and to find out that he shares such intimate details about your personal life with his friends. It’s completely natural to feel uncomfortable and unsure about these behaviours.
It’s important to acknowledge that relationships can be complex, and people may have different ways of interacting with their family members or discussing personal matters. However, it’s also completely understandable that you expected your boyfriend to be more supportive and transparent with his sister about your relationship.
I would encourage you to firstly take some time to reflect on your emotions and concerns surrounding your boyfriend’s interactions with his elder sister. Consider how these incidents have affected your trust, boundaries, and overall perception of the relationship.
If the relationship is something you still very much value and you’d like to work on addressing these issues, perhaps you’d like to have a conversation with your boyfriend about this. Although it could be challenging given everything that has transpired, try approaching this conversation in a compassionate and understanding manner - you can express your feelings of confusion and hurt while emphasising that you genuinely care about him and the relationship. Let him know that you value open and honest communication, and that you would like to better understand his perspective on these matters. While it’s essential to address the concerns you have about his sister’s behavior and his sharing of intimate details, it’s also important to listen actively and give him an opportunity to explain himself. Try to create a safe space where both of you can express your feelings and concerns without judgment.
Should you decide to sit down and have a conversation with him about this, try sharing your feelings and observations without blame or accusations by using “I” statements. “I” statements are helpful in expressing how his actions made you feel, rather than making assumptions about his intentions. In doing so, he is less likely to retaliate defensively and this would hopefully allow space for the both of you to have a constructive open conversation. To illustrate, instead of saying “You’re out to embarrass me/You don’t care about how I feel”, you could say “I feel over-exposed/embarrassed when such intimate details of our personal lives are shared with others”. You may find out more on how to use “I” statements here: ‘I’ Statements Instead of ‘You’ Statements in Arguments .
Moving forward, perhaps it would also be in both of your best interests to communicate your expectations and discuss your boundaries. Clearly communicate your expectations regarding communication, boundaries, and privacy within the relationship. Discuss how you would like him to support and stand up for you when it comes to his sister’s behaviour, and emphasise the importance of mutual respect.
If the situation becomes overwhelming or if you find it difficult to resolve these issues on your own, you might consider seeking the support of a couples therapist or counsellor. They can provide guidance and facilitate constructive communication between you and your boyfriend, helping you work through these challenges together.
Remember, your feelings and needs are valid, and it’s important to prioritise your emotional well-being. Trust your instincts and make decisions that feel right for you as you navigate this situation.

Thank you for openly sharing with us. I’m really sorry to hear about what happened to you. It’s understandable that you’re feeling upset and unsure of how to cope with this difficult situation. Remember that it’s important to be kind to yourself and not blame yourself entirely for what happened. Scams, especially in the recent times, can be very sophisticated and designed to deceive even the most cautious individuals. You are most definitely not alone in this.
Like some of the users have mentioned, I’m curious to know if you’ve reported the scam? For what it’s worth, this could help others from falling victim in the future and perhaps assist you in recovering your savings.
In the meantime, here are a couple of suggestions on how you can manage your emotions in this trying time:
2. Allow yourself to feel. It’s natural to feel a wide range of emotions, including anger, sadness, and frustration. Give yourself permission to acknowledge and process these emotions. Find healthy outlets for your feelings, such as talking to a trusted friend, writing in a journal, or engaging in activities you enjoy.
3. Educate yourself: Take this experience as an opportunity to learn about scams, online safety, and financial literacy. Understanding the warning signs and best practices for protecting yourself can help prevent similar situations in the future. This site by the National Crime Prevention Council seems to have comprehensive information on warning signs, types of scams etc in our local context.
4. Take small steps towards rebuilding your savings. While it may feel overwhelming, try to take small steps towards rebuilding your savings once again. Create a budget or financial plan to help you manage your remaining funds wisely. Consider seeking advice from a trusted adult or a financial professional who can guide you through the process. You may also wish to refer to some of the resources we have on money management and financial literacy here.
Lastly, healing from such experiences takes time, and it’s important to be patient and gentle with yourself. As you navigate through this, try to focus on the lessons learned and the steps you can take to protect yourself in the future.

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your feelings and concerns with me. I want to acknowledge the sacrifices you are making as a full-time working mom of three young children. It’s evident that you have a lot on your plate, and it can be challenging to juggle the rigors of work while also managing the ongoing responsibilities at home.
The challenges you’re facing are significant, and it’s understandable that you sometimes feel overwhelmed, emotional, and underappreciated. It can be tough when your husband’s work schedule keeps him away during critical times, leaving you to juggle everything on your own. Your feelings of helplessness are valid and normal.
If you have thoughts about harming yourself, I will encourage you to seek help immediately I.e., visit an emergency department or contact 1767 (SOS 24-hour hotline).
During these demanding times, it’s important to prioritize self-care as best you can. Even in the smallest of moments, find ways to take care of your well-being. Whether it’s taking a brief walk, reading a few pages of a book, listening to uplifting music, or practicing deep breathing exercises, these small acts of self-care can make a meaningful difference in restoring your balance.
Also, consider reaching out to trusted friends who may be able to offer a listening ear and practical assistance. Sharing your struggles with those who care about you can provide a sense of connection and alleviate some of the emotional burden you’re carrying.
Lastly, we want to encourage you to seek help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with a safe space to explore your emotions, develop coping strategies, and offer guidance tailored to your specific circumstances. You deserve support, understanding, and assistance in navigating through these challenging times.

I had some issues with my boyfriend regarding his elder sister. She came to Singapore for awhile and had to leave after a month or so. In that period of time she really wanted to meet me. I was only dating my bf for 3 months at that period. It felt weird that she didn’t give me space. Like I was in his toilet once and she came barging in to knock on my toilet door to see me. Later my boyfriend told me that he had to carry her outside of the room and he laughed about it. I thought that it was extremely weird. He’s 21 and she’s 24. Is this normal? When I told one of this lady who was a psychologist she mentioned that it could be sibling enmeshment. There’s a lot more to this story that I’ve yet to add on.

It does sound like your boyfriend and his sister have a very close relationship. It is tough to say if this is a case of sibling enmeshment as each pair of siblings is different, so what may be normal to them might not be normal to you.
Because this happened during your 3rd month into the relationship, I’m wondering if this could be a case of misunderstanding intentions. For example, perhaps his sister was simply excited to meet you and did not consider that she was overstepping physical boundaries and making you uncomfortable as a result.
Nonetheless, you may wish to communicate how you felt to your boyfriend and establish some boundaries for the future. It might also help to have a conversation with his sister the next time you see her to clear things up and get to know her better.
I hope this helps!",,1,,,,,

3586,Too Many Emotions Simultaneously,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/too-many-emotions-simultaneously/3586,Seeking Help,---,1599,JayHyjinx,User,,4627,1,"I have had a very odd dichotomy for the past five months. I feel intense overwhelm for the June Holidays because I want to get my stuff together but it’s obvious that that can’t happen in a month. Plus, I would only have two weeks because I have to go overseas and I’m freakin’ out about my schoolwork because we still have schoolwork. I feel as if I’m burnt out but it has been five months, it can’t last that long, can it? I feel frustrated with myself that I can’t just get out of this lingering rut and do the things I want. But I know I need patience with myself too, take my time. I’m only a kid, and getting your life together can take months or even years.
I feel intense irritation but pity for two specific friends, and I can point out why too. For the first friend, they’re always sad and depressed. When the room’s all quiet, they would just say that he has clinical depression out of the blue. Due to their sorrow, they don’t have many friends. I am very aware that I’m their closest friend because they basically talk to me whenever I’m around. I try to make small talk so they wouldn’t bring their thoughts into it. I feel really bad that, because of their illness, they can’t seem to connect to anyone. But on the other hand, I’m irritated that they haven’t gone out to help themselves, and that they want everybody to know that their depressed. Like I get it, but we can’t do anything about it. It’s like the song POWDER by Melanie Martinez.
For the second friend, they constantly speak about themselves and just talk hours on end. Their voice is also quite monotonous which makes any conversation sound repeated. Sometimes it actually is repeated. Many of my mates have asked me if I actually consider them a friend, and they shared their own feelings. They say they don’t like this friend because they find them annoying that they keep talking about themselves. I’m assuming they think it’s narcissistic. I feel somewhat the same as they just can’t see that we don’t want to know about them in the moment, without any connection to anything going on right now. However, I’m aware that they have a condition that affects their social skills and development. They need help with certain things that neurotypical people have no trouble doing. They ask me for small favours constantly, which also makes me frustrated, but I understand why. They can’t go through school themselves alone. However, they also cling onto me all the time. Whenever we need to group up, they always want to stick with me, not letting me out of grasp. However, I know it’s because they have an extreme fear of people leaving them, which is why they’re clingy.
I feel irritated with myself because I’m sort of the lonely people magnet. People who are left behind stick onto me like glue. I’m starting to question if I’m the problem. There’s got to be a reason why they want to be around me everyday when I enter the room. I’m also angry at myself for feeling frustrated and hatred for them even though the things that make them unlikable are not in their control. I’ve been wondering if the reasons I feel this hatred is because it’s projection. I witnessed my friend say they hated one of my friends mentioned here, but they are sort of similar. So am I just projecting my feelings towards myself on them? Am I also lonely on the inside, and they can see that in me better than I do?
I am very grateful for the self-awareness granted to me. It helps me ponder deeper about the reasons for why I feel things and do things. Maybe one of the reasons I would want to learn psychology when I’m older haha! However, I have a lot of questions afterward that I can’t really answer. How do I cope with all these feelings in me all at once? Currently, it comes out numb, until I breakdown in tears when they all hit me, and then return back to the numbness. It feels pretty unhealthy and I’m genuinely concerned if I should see someone about this. Any replies would be great, thank you very much!",,0,4639.0,,,,

First of all, thank you for sharing your dichotomy with us, it sounds like there is a lot going on and I’m glad you found an avenue to talk about it here .
I hear that you’re feeling like you can’t even enjoy your June Holidays because of the overwhelming schoolwork and burn out. Not being able to enjoy your time, or not being able to do the things you want to do sounds frustrating. At the same time, you recognized and mentioned that you need patience with yourself, that these things take time. I’m happy to see you give yourself that patience and understanding, and I wholeheartedly agree. School life can be difficult, emotionally and physically, and it is okay to give yourself the breaks and rests you need.
You talk about your irritation with two of your friends, both of which you mentioned that you dislike even though the things that make them unlikeable are out of their control. I think it can be helpful in situations like these to recognize that two things can be true at the same time: your friend’s issues are not their fault and that it’s also normal to feel irritated at them. I also think that you’re very understanding and sympathetic to be able to recognize that they need help, so please be gentler with yourself when it feels like too much. Even with friends who may not be suffering from similar issues as yours, it’s normal to feel like you need your own space/privacy, and it’s important and, very much so okay, to set boundaries.
It seems that you have been aware of these thoughts for a while now and personally, I’m happy to hear you’re considering studying psychology as a fellow psych student . I do think learning more about yourself sometimes comes from learning from others and the field of psychology is full of self-growth and development. Anyways, right now, you have a lot of questions, and I can’t give you the answers because it might be more impactful to find those answers yourself (and I’m sorry if that’s something you didn’t want to hear ). Here are some questions that might lead you closer to an answer:
2. How have you been coping so far and what do you wish to be different? (e.g., would you like to allocate “breaks” or special care of yourself?)
3. Similarly, If you think the current way you process emotions is unhealthy, what would “healthy” look like for you?",,3,,,,,

I hear you on feeling overwhelmed and I can imagine that it is frustrating to juggle between your responsibilities at school and your social life. I want to firstly affirm that going through this phase in life and experiencing such emotions are normal things to do, especially in our youth. I’m curious to know what you mean by ‘getting your life together’. Are you referring to completing all your tasks and responsibilities; perhaps a goal you are trying to accomplish by the end of the June holidays; or is it simply that you wish to start doing the things you want to again? Whichever the case may be, you are absolutely right in that you don’t have to have it all figured out right now. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate and it is okay to take a break from figuring stuff out every once in awhile. Life does not start after getting your life together (it is happening right now!) and you can always change your mind about what you want to do at any point in time.
I hear you on experiencing burnout. This can be tricky if not addressed because burnout does not just go away by simply ignoring it. Self-care is of utmost importance here to recover from this. This includes taking care of your physical health, sleeping well, taking frequent breaks, eating well, and doing what you enjoy. You mentioned going overseas for two weeks and you are worried about the homework you have to complete. It might help to make a plan for what needs to be done for school and prioritize your tasks so you can allocate sufficient time for each assignment. As much as possible, try not to think about homework while you are overseas so you can be present and enjoy your well-deserved break!
Regarding the situation with your friends, I would like to offer a different perspective from you being a ‘lonely people magnet’. It seems to me like you are someone who empathizes well with others, and you genuinely listen to your friends when they are sharing their stories with you. Perhaps they see you as someone safe to be around because you see them for who they are without prejudice. This speaks volumes about your character and I don’t think it is a bad thing at all that people want to be around you. With that said, I do understand your frustration with the situation as you are not responsible for other people and it may seem like they are not doing anything for themselves despite how much you are helping them.

I agree with what Jaws says here, in that you are allowed to set boundaries with your friends and they may not share the same level of self-awareness as you do.
I can’t say if your feelings towards this matter is a form projection or not, but it might be worth exploring. Do you perhaps resemble them in some way that you do not wish others to see? Who or what do your friends remind you about yourself? In what ways do you act like them or is there any area in life where you also show up in the same way? These are some questions that could help you get started.

I’m currently a YR1 poly student taking a design course, and I’m feeling sososo overwhelmed by the things we have to do and the wave of assignments that is hitting me.
The assignments require me to put my all into thinking about creative ideas, and they all require me to put in so much time into doing them, even just hitting the bare minimum, which makes me feel like it’s literally impossible to finish all of them, only some. And the GPA System requires good consistency, but i kinda feel like giving up even though it’s just week 5.
All these work is making me super stressed and unable to take time to sleep.
People talk about the “Sleep - Social life - Grades” Triangle as a guide to managing my work, pick 2 and discard 1, which I discarded social life, because I’m an introvert; but yet I still seem to struggle with the 2.
It makes me wonder if I made the right choice to take this course, even though I do not have interests in anything else, just a bit in design.
Or if I’m just simply unable to take stress, since it seems like my other classmates who have part time jobs are coping well.
Or maybe I’m just not good at this? And since design is a skill which requires experience and time (Which I don’t have) to improve, I feel like i’ll never be good enough and will have to keep struggling more.
Everytime I think of my work I feel like vomiting, and recently I even had a major meltdown thinking about the assignments I have to finish.
If my classmates can cope, why am I struggling so hard?
If everyone says “Adult life is similar/worse” to what I have to go through now, I feel like I’m trapped in an hole i cannot escape from, which makes me despair even more.
I seriously don’t know what to do, and all this inescapable negativity my assignments remind me of is taking a huge toll on myself. I’m not even a perfectionist, I just want to do well.
I wish there was a manual for this, because I really don’t know what to do.",,3,,,,,

Thank you for sharing about your situation and how you feel. I hear that you are feeling really overwhelmed by the heavy workloads and wave of assignments that seem to be piling up. I also hear that you are feeling stressed when the thoughts of not being able to cope and not good enough come by. While stress is a natural body’s response to challenges and demands in life, ongoing and intense stress can affect our productivity and take a toll on our health and wellbeing.
It may be true that the current challenge that you’re facing seem like a mission impossible, but if you step back and take a look at the journey you have walked, you may begin to realise that “ehh actually I’ve managed to accomplish ABC and overcome XYZ”. This new chapter you’re in may be really challenging, but keep heart that it also brings new opportunities for growth and self-discovery.
So, take a deep breath and have a go with the following steps to help you recenter and do what matters when things get overwhelming.
2. Firstly, give yourself time to adjust. Starting a new course in a new environment is itself not an easy task. Having to cope with the adjustments in routines, changes in social settings, on top of the demanding workloads—you’re indeed handling some really tough stuffs here. Instead of letting thoughts such as “it’s impossible”, “am I making the right choice”, “maybe i’m not good at this”, “why can’t I cope as well as others” beat you down; hold yourself kindly and give yourself the support and understanding you need to navigate through these difficult times. It would be a lot easier to focus on your assignments when you respond to the situation you’re in with kindness rather than self-criticisms or self-doubts.
3. Write it down—instead of thinking about all the deadlines and tasks that you have to complete, which can flood your mind and leave you with no idea where to even start, start writing them down. Big and small; tall and short—write everything that’s in your mind down. This will free up space in your mind so that you can properly plan and prioritise the tasks you need to accomplish, and to tick them off one by one. You will also be able to see clearly, identify, and eliminate tasks that you do not have to do or are unimportant to your overall goals.
4. Ask—get your questions answered. Sometimes we fall behind or unable to start doing things due to confusion or lack of clarity. If you’re unsure about a certain task, ask questions and figure it out. In class, after class, office hours, or via email. There are ample of opportunities to get an answer and the lecturers are usually very available to support you.
5. Reach out to people you trust—Social support is a powerful factor in reducing overwhelm and increasing resilience. I hear that you cut off your social life to prioritise your sleep and grades; and you mentioned that this has not been working well. How about try connecting with a loved one or close friend—anyone whom you feel comfortable with—and share with him or her about how you feel. This does not need to take long and does not have to involve a lot of people. The person may not be able to solve the challenges that you’re facing but he or she may be able to provide you the emotional support and a space to relieve your stress. You may even gain new and fresh perspectives to your current situation through the interactions.
Finally, starting poly and navigating through life transitions can be challenging, but know that you don’t have to go through this journey alone as help is always available. Do consider visiting a clinical professional if the current state of overwhelm persists and you sense that it’s interfering with your daily activities and health.
I hope this help. Take good care",,3,,,,,

I’m not very familiar with design work but it does seem like you’ll need to get your creative juices flowing to some extent. Sometimes it’s not easy but maybe can try some of suggestions?
- Take a break. Sometimes the best way to get creative is to take a break from whatever you’re working on. Go for a walk, listen to some music, or take a nap. When you come back to your work, you’ll be refreshed and ready to think creatively.
- Change your environment. If you’re feeling stuck, try changing your environment. Go to a different coffee shop, work in a different room of your house. A change of scenery can help you to see things from a new perspective and spark new ideas.
- Talk to someone. Sometimes the best way to get creative is to talk to someone else. Brainstorming with a friend or colleague can help you to come up with new ideas.
- Do something you enjoy. When you’re feeling creative, it’s important to do something you enjoy. This could be anything from painting to playing music to writing poetry. Doing something you enjoy will help you to relax and let your creativity flow.
- Don’t be afraid to fail. Everyone fails at something creative at some point. Don’t let this discourage you. Just keep trying and eventually you’ll find your stride.

Thanks for penning your thoughts here!
Firstly I just wanted to reassure you that its totally understandable for someone in your position to feel overwhelmed and stressed. Transitioning from secondary school to polytechnic can be a challenging time indeed – like you said, if only there is a manual on “How to Poly”.
The previous responses are very helpful and comprehensive. Don’t want to risk overwhelming you further so if you don’t mind, I will just share a bit from my own personal experience as a polytechnic graduate. Your struggles matter and I care about your well-being, so in sharing I hope to let you know that I relate to much of what you have said and you are not alone
2. It is very normal (and common!) to think that everyone else is “coping well” but us. Something a senior once shared with me that really stuck is that secretly, everyone else thinks the same way. It is also quite natural to want to present the most “put together” versions of ourselves – the unintended effect is that we might think we are the only ones struggling. Looking at it in this way really helped me feel less alone in my struggles and more confident initiating conversations about what I am struggling with (like what you are already doing now, which is great!).
3. There are a lot of adjustments to make when transitioning to poly, some of which you have already raised yourself (eg. Waves of assignments, getting used to the GPA system). At one point, I too felt overwhelmed by this new system and having to navigate this new environment with new expectations. Something that helped me was having a social support to turn to. In my case, I had a close group of classmates whom I trust and got along with. We would study together and help each other brainstorm difficult assignments in between and after classes (other types of social support could look like school counselors, friendly lecturers, family, or even friends from your previous phases of education). Apart from feeling less alone, this was also one way that allowed me to maintain a social life while focusing on my work!
4. As you pointed out, the GPA system does require a fair amount of consistency because every semester’s work counts unlike the O level system in secondary school. As students, its normal to want to do well in school too. What I personally found helpful was to break the process into smaller steps by taking things one semester at a time and prioritizing my assignments. This took the pressure off me worrying in advance about maintaining consistent quality work throughout my 3 years which helped make things feel a lot less intimidating and manageable for me.
These are just some of my own experiences, and everyone’s journey through tertiary education looks different!

im considering to go, but theres 2 things ‘holding me back’
2. parental consent
ive been dismissed and told to ‘pray it away’ so idk. and i know its gonna be a big shock to them since ive been acting ‘normally’ in front of them. im really scared of my parents reacting badly, because if my siblings need help too, they’ll have to deal with the certainty of a bad reaction and i really dont want that to happen.
so id like to know what can potentially happen and when will they actually inform your parents.
3. its my own brain, really
a part tells me that all i need to do is suck it up, do better and be better. i dont know if i can because ive talked to mental health screeners and they suspected bipolar 2 disorder. but ngl, i feel kind of embarrassed and scared, ‘what if im making it all up and everyone feels like that’ or ‘all i have to do is make big lifestyle changes and be better and it will be alright’ or ‘what if its confirmation bias?’. its stupid, its confusing and its very conflicting.",,0,,,,,
3427,what happens after i ask to see a psychiatrist?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/what-happens-after-i-ask-to-see-a-psychiatrist/3427,Seeking Help,---,194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),4453,2,"Dear @jwywg,
Thank you for sharing your concerns about seeking professional help. It sounds like you are struggling with the difficult decision about seeking mental health treatment, and you’re worried about how your parents may react to this decision, all whilst also trying to manage your own doubts and fears. Your worries are very much valid, and I want to firstly reassure you that you do not have to face these concerns on your own.
Locally, parental consent is required for most medical procedures, including mental health treatment, if you are a minor i.e. under 21 years old. However, there are some exceptions where minors can consent to their own treatment, such as in cases where there is a risk of harm or neglect.
It’s completely understandable to be worried about how your parents may react, especially if they have dismissed your concerns in the past. It may be helpful to have a conversation with them about your mental health concerns, and explain why seeking treatment is important for your wellbeing. From what you’ve shared, I can imagine that this could be a difficult and nervewrecking conversation to have. Here are a couple of tips to help you prepare for this conversation, should you be open to trying to speak to them about this:
2. Plan what you want to say beforehand and try practising this out loud
3. Choose the right time and place - It’s important to have this conversation at a time and place that feels safe and comfortable for both you and your parents.
4. Start with the facts - Begin the conversation by sharing the facts about your mental health concerns. Explain what you’re experiencing and why it’s important for you to seek treatment. Using “I” statements to share your feelings could also help avoid any sense of placing blame on your parents.
5. Seek support - It may be helpful to have a trusted family member or friend present during the conversation for support. They can help you navigate the conversation and provide emotional support.
However, if you do not feel comfortable talking to your parents about this, or should the conversation go in an unintended direction, you may wish to speak to a mental health professional at greater length to discuss your options and develop a plan for treatment. There are various mental health services available, including public hospitals, private clinics, and non-profit organisations. If you’re not sure where to start, you can refer to the National Mental Health Resource directory here to look through your options. You’ll find a description included with each service along with contact details.
It’s common to have doubts and fears about seeking mental health treatment, but it’s important to remember that taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. If a mental health screener has suspected bipolar 2 disorder, it’s worth exploring this further and seeking an evaluation from a mental health professional who can help you develop a treatment plan that meets your needs.
I hope this information is helpful, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!",here 7 https://www.ncss.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ncss-publications-doc/directory-on-mental-health-services.pdf,3,,,,,

It seems like you have a lot on your plate right now with responsibilities at home and at work. It is understandable that you would be facing quite a bit of stress. I hear that taking magnesium supplements no longer help as effectively and you are experiencing frequent headaches throughout the day more. If you have been experiencing the headaches more than twice weekly for the past couple of weeks to a month, I highly encourage that you seek medical advice on this. It is not normal for tension-headaches (i.e. stress headaches) to occur that frequently, especially if you are requiring painkillers for it often.
In the meantime, here are some suggestions might help improve your sleep and mood:
2. You may wish to try the 10-3-2-1 sleep method.
10 hours before bed- no caffeine.
3 hours before bed - no more food or alcohol.
2 hours before bed - no more work.
1 hour before bed - no more screen time.
This is a simple guide for good sleep hygeine that you may wish to incoporate in your daily routine. I understand that it may not work for everyone’s schedule and I can imagine that having two children to care for might make this step challenging, so please feel free to make any relevant adjustments that would fit into your lifestyle best!
3. Have a wind down routine. An example of this would be to practice mindfulness through meditation before bed to help clear your head and relax your body. Here are some relaxing and meditative tools you may wish to try out:
(https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=sleep_deeply )
(Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Workplace Mental Health | mindline.sg )
Alternatively, here is a quick 10min guided meditation video on YouTube you may wish to follow if you prefer an audio guide: (10-Minute Meditation For Sleep - YouTube )
It may also be helpful to refer back to these tools if you awaken in the middle of the night to re-relax your body and allow your mind to drift back to sleep.
4. Take frequent breaks from work and engage in activities you enjoy more often. This can be as simple as taking a quick 10min break to watch funny videos on your phone, eating your favourite food for lunch everyday, or treating yourself to an ice cream after dinner. The idea here is to reduce your stress levels and elevate your mood, even if they are for pockets at a time. It would be ideal if you can afford to take longer breaks and do longer activities like going for a massage (if that is what you’d enjoy), but I can imagine that you would tend to have a rather packed schedule throughout the day. Nonetheless, take your time and explore what works for you! You deserve to have fun and a good day as much as the next person does, regardless of your busy schedule.
I hope that these suggestions help, and I wish you all the best! o( ❛ᴗ❛ )o",https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=sleep_deeply 6 https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=sleep_deeply; Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Workplace Mental Health | mindline.sg 4 https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=become_aware; 10-Minute Meditation For Sleep - YouTube 5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEqlQvczMJQ,1,,,,,

2776,Having trouble forgiving my perpetuators,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/having-trouble-forgiving-my-perpetuators/2776,Coping,wellness,1873,Beast,User,,3737,1,"I have ever been emotionally abused during my teenage years by my sister. Name calling, emasculating, claiming my space as her own, you name it. Anything that isn’t physical abuse, but still cuts as deep or even deeper. During the worst times, I tried to seek help from my parents, but to no avail. The saddistic perpeatuator then took the advantage to further her actions and get away with them, just to satisfy her ego. I was effectively being emotionally neglected. I didn’t have enough courage to commit suicide but cutting emotional ties with them seemed a feasible coping mechanism. I lost trust in my whole family.
Until today I keep them at arms length. I don’t believe in family anymore. I’m a 25yo working adult and I only see them as a responsibility, not a safe haven. I see that my friends can tease their family members, say those nice cringey “I love you” messages on their IG posts, but I can’t bring myself to say that I love my family members. To cope with my loneliness, i tried to make friends outside and, as I realised recently, construct a “family” outside of my home that I can grow in. At times I wonder if this is the right thing to do, because my friends are not obligated to stay by my side forever. and I agree with that. To maintain my “family” I just make more close friends. But I’m still scarred. I feel that a sense of anxiety & caution undermines my daily emotions. I have never been able to truly live in the moment, never able to truly connect with the world emotionally in a layman setting. Something as simple as expressing happiness at a birthday surprise takes rehearsing in my head to be able to look normal. Most of the time, I look retarded. Turns out I did not just build barriers between my family & I but with the world.
All this while, I have met many great people I look up to. People with qualities I desire. People with values I value. People whom I really want to be by my side forever. But because I have built all those barriers and I feel that anxiety undermining my daily emotions, I feel handicapped. As a result, I feel like they deserve better people than a lowlife like me who still can’t get over his ■■■■.
I’ve spent a year reflecting and I feel that I am ready to remove these barriers to relive my life again. But there’s something holding me back: my family. I still feel anger well up in me when I shared my story above. If you asked me what the hell happened back then, I’d say I only remember the emotions: injustice, unfairness, prejudice, abuse of gender stereotypes, name calling, hypocrisy, whatever you can legally get away with. It’s weird in a bad way when you’re living with all your perpetuators and they never really addressed the part about me being abused or neglected…because they may not even think of it that way. A part of me wants to ditch this whole family and start a new elsewhere.
A counsellor has advised me to forgive. He explained that it doesn’t mean reconciliation. It’s done for yourself, by yourself. I didn’t spend enough time with him to walk me through the entire process. I guess I can do the rest by myself, but as a first step, I want to be able to forgive myself and my family members for all they have done and not done so I can go live my life outside without being bogged down by anxiety and the barriers I built.
Thanks for reading this far. I appreciate your time.",,4,,,,,
2776,Having trouble forgiving my perpetuators,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/having-trouble-forgiving-my-perpetuators/2776,Coping,wellness,1383,Jane,Professional,Professional,3954,2,"Hi @Beast thank you for sharing your story. I’m sorry to hear that you had to go through such an ordeal in your teenage years. It must have been frustrating for you to be treated that way, and to have your parents be unsupportive of you emotionally in your time of need. All your feelings are valid and it is understandable if you do not feel ready to forgive.
I hear you and I can see why you would keep your distance from your family, and choose to build your own with your friends instead. There is no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ with a decision like this. I can imagine that what you went through was awful enough for you to feel this way, and I want to let you know that is it ok to walk away if you choose to do so. Families are complicated and sometimes they can be toxic. If what you are doing by walking away is protecting yourself and removing yourself from a toxic environment, then that’s just more power to you. Conversely, I also understand that filial piety is very prevalent in asian households, and if you feel the want to make up with your family and forgive them eventually, that is ok as well!
You do not have to make a decision to go in either direction before working on your anxiety and barriers, and living the life that you want. A part of moving forward is accepting what has happened and coming to terms with it. This does not necessarily mean forgiveness, and it certainly does not mean you have to forget. But if your past is preventing you from living your life in the present, then perhaps you may wish to consider what you need from this in order to move on. Is it an apology for all the wrongdoings done to you? Or perhaps it’s simply the acknowledgement by your parents that you did not show up when you needed them to. I agree with the counsellor in that forgiveness does not mean reconciliation and it is something that can be done by yourself. If it helps, perhaps instead of forgiveness, seek closure from what has happened so you can allow yourself to move on from that chapter of your life.
Whatever it is, you can take the time to think about it while still living your life. You are so much more than what you went through and you deserve to experience life the way you want to. I am glad that you have people around you that you can look up to and you are formulating an environment that allows you to grow as a person. You are worthy of surrounding yourself with the people who value you and whom you value, so don’t cut yourself short on this. Despite how you may view yourself, the people around you have chosen to stay because they see value in you as a friend. I agree with what you said, that friends are not obligated to stay. So the fact that they do anyway should speak volumes.
Finally, I would like to encourage you to continue counselling or therapy. It sounds like it had helped you in some ways and I hope you can continue having that support. Please feel free to reach out again if you require any resources regarding this or anything else.
All the best!",,3,,3737,,3737.0,

I can imagine it hasn’t been easy for you, so to decide on the path of forgiveness is admirable. I hear you on wanting to work on this on your own and I would highly encourage that you resume counselling for this, if possible. Your counsellor would be able to better help you navigate through this journey and process any tricky emotions that may arise.
While I do not have specific exercises that would guarantee forgiveness, here are some prompts you may find useful to reflect upon:
- What does forgiveness mean to you? Are you on this journey for your family or for yourself?
- If you are often angry when you think about your family because of bad memories, what are some good memories you can replace them with?
- As difficult as it may be, try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Perhaps you are right in that your parents may not even have considered what happned to be abuse. Maybe your parents did not know what to do or who to side with amongst their children. This does not justify their actions by any means, but it may help you gain an understanding of where they might be coming from. Here is an exercise you may wish to try out that could help you with gaining perspective: (https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=gain_perspective )
- Forgiveness does not exonerate what the other person has done. Just because you forgive someone does not mean that they are freed from accountability, nor does it mean that they can continue with their behaviour. Instead, forgiveness is for yourself to no longer hold onto the hurt you feel and let it take over your other emotions. Forgiveness does not mean that they deserve to be forgiven, but rather it means that you deserve to have peace. Forgiveness is not a gift to the person who has wronged you, but a gift of freedom to yourself from what has happened.
- If it helps, you may wish to rephrase the word forgiveness into releasing. Release yourself from the past. Release the anger and resentment you are holding onto. Release the bad memories you are reminded of when you think of your family.
- I respect that your decision may not necessarily entail reconciliation or rebuilding the relationships with your family members. However, it may help to see your family through a compassionate lens. Think about memories separate from the bad events. The good times you shared or times they managed to show up for you. They might not have done you right in the past, but they might be better people now. See them for who they are and not who they were. It might also help to put things into perspective when you think of times that you were the one seeking forgiveness for something you have done, and how you have grown from those experiences.
Forgiveness, like any other healing journey, is not always linear. Sometimes we are reminded of what has happened and we might feel hurt again. When this happens, remind yourself of your goal and be patient.

Your friends can never become your family, especially those who will go on to create their own families.
I faced a similar situation as you. My family was quite dysfunctional too. I knew I couldn’t count on friends because they are merely passing by in our lives. So the only way to solve this issue is to start my own real family. Use your experience with your sister and parents to create a family that you want.

2398,An ‘empty dread’ every day,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/an-empty-dread-every-day/2398,Seeking Help,"needadvice, emotions",1699,Koki,User,,3334,1,"Basically, every day I feel dread. On school days I just dread the next day and hope for the weekend to come. It’s empty in the sense that it is always just lingering there, subtly in the background. I can feel it, but it doesn’t feel like much. Only sometimes I think about it, and I get a sudden ‘hit’ of dread and I just have overwhelming thoughts about wanting to go home and not wanting to go to school, even if I’m already at home. It passes relatively fast, but the feeling is still there, just not as bad, and more ‘empty’ than dread.
Then on the weekends, I expect to wake up and finally feel new and get things done the way I used to. But now, every weekend feels the same, and honestly it feels worse than when I’m at school. When I’m at school the dread lingers a lot more subtly, but at home, especially on weekends, it’s very much there and it feels so constant.
I hate the feeling of dread, so I just scroll through social media and never get anything done. I always just manage to do what I need to do, like homework right before the due date. But I never end up doing what I actually want to do, like my hobbies.
Thinking about my homework and hobbies just make me feel so much more dread, but I ignore it all, and it stays empty.

Thank you for reaching out and sharing with me about how you are feeling. It seems like you are experiencing feeling of dread not just during school days but also during the weekend which you’re actually so looking forward to. I appreciate your courage in sharing as I could imagine how overwhelming and confusing it can be to constantly be in this unexplainable emotional state yet at the same time you’re unsure of what to do to make yourself feel better.
Here are some ways that you can try to help you cope with the feeling:
2. Find out what is causing the dread—One important first step in managing any difficult feelings is to determine what is causing them. The answer may be evident to you but it can be hard to describe. By knowing the underlying condition contributing to the feelings, we can take the necessary steps/action to resolve the source of concern and free you to feeling good again.
3. Write it down—If you find it a struggle to identify the cause of your dread, take a piece of paper and write out everything that you’re concerned/worried/unhappy about. This can give you a clearer picture of what is/are contributing to you feeling dreaded/empty and help you to emotionally distance yourself from all these unwanted feelings.
4. Draw it out—If writing is not what you want to do, try drawing. Draw your dread. How does it look like? Expressing your feelings and emotions nonverbally can be a helpful way to reframe your attitudes and help you accept and better cope with them.
5. Schedule your dread—You mentioned that because of this constant feeling of dread you’re unable to do the things which you wanted to do i.e. hobbies. Perhaps set a fix period of dread time, say 15 minutes. Rather than spending the whole weekend scrolling through social media and never getting anything done, commit to following the schedule you planned in advance. Once the dread time is over, we say goodbye to the dread for now and move on to doing other things.
6. Practice mindfulness—Often times people spend too much time being caught up in the negative feelings/emotions that they experience and overlook the beauty of their surroundings. Try stepping back from the emotional state, and then take a deep breathe and see the feelings as they are. This can help heighten your internal calm and self-awareness, enabling you to focus on the present without getting overwhelmed by the difficult feelings.
7. Do something different—Change the environment/atmosphere by going out for a walk or turning on your favourite songs. Doing things differently can be a helpful way to connect us back to the environment and bring our senses back to the current state.
8. Talk to someone—Know that feeling of dread is normal. People can feel dreaded thinking about deadlines, meetings, exams, and sometimes even when having to run simple errands or going away for a holiday; you’re not alone in feeling dreaded. Find someone whom you can trust and share with him or her about how you’re feeling. The person may not be able to understand or get rid of your feeling of dread altogether but sharing may help you relieve the overwhelming pressure that keeps you feeling powerless.
Finally, navigating through feeling of dread and any kind of difficult feelings/emotions can be tough. I may not have the context to fully understand your feeling of dread, but I want you to know that you don’t have to suffer alone as help is always available. Do consider visiting a medical professional if the feeling persists and you sense that it’s interfering with your physical and mental health.
I hope this helps. Know that I care for you and we care for you. Take care (:",,3,,,,,

I don’t understand this part though. Any examples of things that you enjoy but still causes dread? Maybe one way is to do something completely different from your usual routine. Something that you’ve never imagined yourself doing and take that time to savour the different feelings that you’ll get. Maybe it’s a mix of excitement, anticipation and perhaps a fear of the unknown but I guess that could be a good change from the constant dread that you’re feeling.

Thank you for reaching out and sharing about your experience. It must have been really overwhelming being plagued by worries and anxious thoughts every single day. You mentioned sobbing uncontrollably at night when the ‘brain gets too noisy’; and losing the ability to focus on tasks or to do things that you used to enjoy. I can imagine how difficult the experience has been for you and I’m so glad that you managed to find this platform to talk about it.
Firstly, while your worrying may seem or feel like a constant in your life, know that such tendency is a mental habit that can be altered. You can train your brain to tame the anxious thoughts and regain control over the situation. Here are a few steps that you may try:
2. Identify it—Identify what you are worried about and distinguish between solvable and unsolvable worries. Write them down using a piece of paper. If the worries are solvable, brainstorm a list of possible solutions, as many as you can. Evaluate and pick the ones that you can address in the short term, then make an action plan. This helps put your worries into perspective and enable you to realise that you actually have the power to make the change you want.
3. Notice it—If the worries are unsolvable, rather than actively trying to change, fight, or suppress your thoughts, take a step back and look at your thoughts as they are. Notice that you’re having the thoughts and say to yourself ‘I am having the thought that… and this is making me feel…’. Try imagining the thought (and any new worrying thoughts) as clouds drifting through the sky. Let them come and go. Even if they don’t seem to be going away, let them be there. Know that you can simply observe your thoughts without engaging them.
4. Schedule—Rather than letting the worry dominate your whole day and affecting how you relate to people as well as carrying out your daily tasks, set a daily worrying period. Choose a fix time and place for your worrying (e.g. 3pm-3.15pm in your room). Put this on your daily agenda and make it consistent. When the time arrives, worry as much as you want. Once this 15 minutes have elapsed, put the worries away and transition back to your daily routine. If you find yourself worrying outside of the scheduled time, acknowledge that and gently remind yourself to save it for the worry time.
5. Interrupt the worry cycle—If the worry gets really intense and overwhelming to the extend that you feel like you are spiralling out of control, get up and leave the current place. Go out for a walk or visit a friend. If changing the environment is not possible, change the atmosphere. Turn on your favorite songs or take a long shower. It may be difficult in the beginning but the more you do this the easier it gets. Persistent and consistent is the key.
6. Talk it out—Find someone whom you trust and share with them about what is troubling you. Verbalising your worries may help to alleviate some of the anxiety and connecting with others may help to offer a fresh perspective to your worries.
Finally, being caught in a cycle of worry that never seems to end may feel scary and isolating, but know that you don’t have to suffer alone as help is always available. Do consider visiting a clinical professional if the worrying persists and you sense that it’s interfering with your physical and mental health.
I hope this help. Know that you deserve peace of mind and you have the power to make the change you want. Take good care (:",,1,,,,,

I can’t find the energy to do things, and I have no interest in them either. And it’s all because of Alzheimer’s, as every day I wake up and feel deathly afraid of it, I don’t want to see everyone I love disappear.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and worries with us. I hear that you’ve been experiencing a great amount of sadness and fear related to Alzheimer’s disease, to the extent that it’s impacting your ability to enjoy life and find energy to do things. I can imagine that this can be a really challenging and overwhelming experience. It’s understandable to feel scared about the potential loss of memories and the people you care about. I’d like to reassure you that we are here to support you through this difficult time and provide you with coping strategies to hopefully help you manage these feelings.
While it is natural to feel scared and anxious when facing the possibility of Alzheimer’s disease, I’d like for you to know that fixating on the disease can be counterproductive and can actually make you feel worse. Focusing solely on the disease can amplify patterns of negative thoughts, making them even more difficult to break out of.
I encourage you to instead try shifting your focus towards other aspects of your life that bring you joy and fulfilment. While Alzheimer’s may be a part of our reality, it doesn’t have to be our entire reality. Engaging in enjoyable activities and connecting with others can help in alleviating the intensity of your worries. It can be difficult to find the energy and motivation to engage in activities when you’re feeling overwhelmed and disinterested, but it’s important to start taking small steps towards engaging in activities again. To help you get started, you could try the following:
- Identify activities that you used to enjoy and try reintroducing them into your routine
- Start small – you could start by e.g. scheduling 10 mins each day for a walk in the park, if you enjoy taking walks. Then gradually increase the amount of time you’re doing this for and incorporate more challenging activities at your own pace.
It can also be helpful to have an accountability partner, such as a trusted friend or family member who can support you and encourage you to engage in these activities you’ve planned out for yourself. Remember to take things at your own pace – it’s okay if you don’t feel like engaging in activities right away, but set a timeline for yourself.
You could also try addressing negative thoughts related to Alzheimer’s and challenging them with more positive, realistic thoughts. I’m linking a thought reframing exercise here (1) for you to try out.
Lastly, I would encourage you to learn more about Alzheimer’s by looking up reliable sources – this would probably help you feel better prepared and empowered. Here (2) is one to start with.
While I’m not extremely familiar with the album “Everywhere at the End of Time” that you’d mentioned, from my understanding, the progression of each stage in the album is meant to reflect the trajectory of dementia over time. Although the music is emotionally powerful and thought-provoking, it is important to bear in mind that it is, at the end of the day, an artistic representation rather than a scientifically accurate depiction of dementia. Dementia is a complex condition that can manifest in a variety of ways, and the progression of the disease can also vary widely. I would encourage you to speak with a qualified healthcare provider or to read up more on the condition.
Please know that we are here to support you. Feel free to follow up with any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, and please take care!

I’ve approached my parents before, but I was met with a negative reaction. I was told that I was getting enough attention from them, that I was just trying to follow a trend, and that I don’t act like their friends who have ADHD. Somehow or rather, they’ve completely neglected the fact that they are both not certified to diagnose anyone for ADHD.
I’m not sure what to do now, as the days pass I get more and more sure that I have it. I want to seek help before my mental health deteriorates further as I develop anxiety from growing pressures caused by the lack of a diagnosis for ADHD. How should I go about getting to a doctor for it? Is there a solution other than convincing my parents?",,1,,,,,

What do I do?",https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-think-i-have-adhd-but-my-parents-are-objecting-to-diagnosis-what-do-i-do/3182,Seeking Help,"needadvice, mentalhealth",1383,Jane,Professional,Professional,4310,2,"Hey @junn, thanks for your question! While it does sound like you might have some symptoms of ADHD, I would like to firstly stress that you do not self-diagnose. Doing so will only lead you to feel stressed about it and it sounds like you are already feeling pressured to get a diagnosis for it. The symptoms you mentioned are more common than you think, especially for those in their teens! I am not saying this to discredit your symptoms by any means, I just wanted to let you know that you are so much more than any amount of symptoms you may have, and getting a diagnosis does not change who you are as a person.
Unfortunately, in most cases, you cannot get a formal evaluation for ADHD without parental consent. What you could do in this case would be to reach out to your teachers or school counsellor and let them know your predicament. They would be able to discuss the issue with your parents and advise you on the next step.
In the meantime, here are some things we can do to help your symptoms:
2. Practice good sleep hygiene and ensure that you are getting proper sleep. Restful and restorative sleep helps tremendously with regulating emotions, improving memory, and maintaining attention throughout the day. Additionally, sleep deprivation actually amplifies ADHD symptoms and it is easier to experience stimulation overload. Here is a tool on sleep hygiene you may wish to try (https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=sleep_hygiene )
3. Implement relaxation techniques in your daily routine. This does not have to be done at set times of the day, feel free to practice this whenever you feel a bit frantic or just need to chill out during a study break. Here is a relaxation exercise (https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=soothe_your_mind ) and a mindfulness exercise (https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=learn_mindfulness) to get you started.
4. Take exercise breaks. On top of health benefits and relieving stress, physical activity is known for improving ADHD symptoms. Whenever you are feeling overwhelmed or like you can no longer concentrate on your study material, take a break to do some physical activity. This can be as simple as taking a walk, doing some push ups, or even dancing! The point is to get your body moving and your mind away from what is stressing you out. Exercise breaks can be done in shorter bursts of time as well, so it can be easily implemented throughout your regular day.
5. Eat nutritiously. The food we eat has a big impact on our brains and how we function. Having a balanced diet has benefits beyond improving ADHD symptoms. This includes eating foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. fish like salmon or tuna, nuts and seeds like chia seeds or walnuts) and protein (e.g. eggs, pork, poultry). Conversely, avoid foods high in sugar and caffeine as may cause over stimulation. You may reach out to your family doctor or dietician to learn more about the right kind of foods for you.
I hope this helps!",https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=sleep_hygiene 1 https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=sleep_hygiene; https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=soothe_your_mind 1 https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=soothe_your_mind; https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=learn_mindfulness https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=learn_mindfulness,1,,,,,

I’m sorry to hear that you are having a difficult time right now with your home life. Having to cope with the loss of your mother and transitioning to living with your maternal family must not have been easy for you.
It sounds like you feel misunderstood by your relatives and instead of trying to understand what you are stressed about, they just want to make things right in their own ways. I wonder if communicating your needs to them would help to improve this situation. Perhaps if you help them understand what is truly stressing you out, they might be able to see things from your perspective and adapt their support for you. Clear and calm communication might also help reduce the arguments that occur. Alternatively, you might wish to refrain from stressful topics altogether and talk about the positive things that happened in your day instead. This would help keep the conversations lighthearted and allow you to guide the topics so you will feel more comfortable talking to them.
I hear you on wanting to get a place of your own and I am glad that you are working hard and saving money so you can achieve that goal! I respect that you may wish to simply continue avoiding your relatives in the meantime, but it may be a while before you are able to move out and it seems like there is tension and frustration because of your avoidance thus far. Perhaps consider the suggestion on communicating with them, and please feel free to let us know if you need any help on that! We’re here to support you ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶",,1,,,,,

Im not a healthcare professional, but as someone who had mental health issues, your case does sound like you have a specific condition and require professional help…
No need to be shy, you will find many ppl with similar situations if you browse this forum.
It is good that you see a therapist/medical professional, as only they can diagnose you and set you on the road to recovery via medication etc.
But in my opinion, much of the recovery stems from within. There has to be certain causes/triggers that led to this situation e.g. school stress, job stress, family and peer pressure, self-esteem issues. To make a full recovery, you will likely have to face your inner demons, and find a way to resolve them or avoid them.
Three tips I found VERY useful in my journey:
2. You are not your feelings. This is something I read from a book (Untethered Soul). In a nutshell, feelings are a semi-physical response, such as fight or flight feelings when encountering a dangerous situation. Do not think of controlling your emotions or feeling guilty for having bad feelings; emotions can arise but learn to let them pass by.
3. Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) - emotions are irrational, but your brain is rational. Go through this 4 step technique to assess whether your thoughts are justified, and let them go if they are not
4. Lastly, it seems you have a lot of (unjustified) self-hate. Read the book “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck” Times are hard, but we only have one self - learn to love and cherish yourself, despite what others tell you
Take care!",,3,,,,,

Thanks for opening up and congratulations on taking the first step to seeking help from the community.
Yes, I have been through the types of emotions you are going through right now. It isn’t very nice, but simultaneously, this is a powerful lesson of our life happening in real-time.
This might sound tough, but fighting these emotions and feelings can only worsen them. Why not try to talk to them, yes, I mean literal talking. This dissolves a certain aspect of these troubling thoughts.
You can talk it out by: Journaling on a piece of paper, talking to a neutral person or mentor or friend, recording your voice notes , talking in front of a mirror.

I heard you on this and agreed 100% about it. That’s where you need to talk to a neutral, non-judgemental human being who has time to listen to you. Well, who could that be? A life coach, mentor or therapist.
And yes, there are hundreds of solution that can be posted here but it’s best to personalise the solutions mostly.

Thanks for sharing your feelings with us. It sounds like you are going through a lot right now, and I want to firstly acknowledge the courage it takes to seek therapy and to express these feelings. It takes a great deal of strength to confront our emotions and to ask for help, and I want to assure you that you are not alone in this.
What you’ve described sounds like symptoms of depression and anxiety, and I can imagine that these can be very overwhelming and difficult to manage. It’s important to bear in mind that these feelings are not your fault, and you deserve the support and care to help you cope and heal.
It’s understandable to feel frustrated when grounding techniques like box breathing and other coping mechanisms don’t seem to work, but please know that there are also many other different techniques and strategies that can be further explored with your therapist that may work better for you. Some other examples include progressive muscle relaxation (1) and behavioural activation strategies. Behavioural activation is a way of helping you feel better by doing things that you enjoy and that are important to you. Sometimes when we’re feeling down or sad, we don’t feel like doing anything or we might not feel motivated to do the things we used to like to do. However, by starting to do those things again, even if it’s just a little bit at a time, we can start to feel better and more motivated. You could start by thinking of activities that you find rewarding and list them down here (2), then choose an activity that is most feasible to be incorporated into your current routine and put down a date and time for you to carry it out here (3). The idea is to try to engage in some of these activities again, even if for a short amount of time. I will link some references below for you to try out. It’s also important to note that therapy is a collaborative process, and I’d like to assure you that it is okay to communicate with your therapist about what is and what isn’t working for you in this recovery process.
I’d also like to address your concerns about getting too attached to your therapist. It is only natural to feel a strong connection with someone who provides you with emotional validation and support. However, the client-therapist relationship in therapy is one that is professional and should be maintained with clear boundaries. A good therapist will be able to help you navigate these boundaries while still offering you the support that you need in this time. I would encourage you to explore these concerns with your therapist so that you may work together to establish a healthy therapeutic relationship.
Lastly, I want to encourage you to continue seeking support and reaching out to those around you whom you trust and who care about you. It can be tough to open up and share about what you’re going through, but the people who love you would want to support and be there for you. You could also consider joining online support groups or continuing to lean on community forums such as this one to express your feelings, just as what you’ve done here. Your therapist should also be able to connect you with the appropriate resources and support as needed.
I’d like to end off by thanking you again for your courage in sharing. Please know that you are not alone, and that there is hope for healing and recovery for as long as you don’t give up on yourself. You’ve come a long way and we are here to support you. Feel free to follow up with any questions and thoughts, and I wish you well!

Learn to be bold, be unashamed, be dumb, make mistakes, because its the same for everyone - some just hide it better than others.

I only realised this during my 1st long term relationship which lasted for a year as the signs of being a disorganised-fearful avoidant only surface towards my romantic partner. My previous partner also gave me trauma where he had no boundaries with certain female “friends”, checked out other girls in public in front of me and always looked at provocative pictures of girls.
This really broke my confidence and during that period of time, i turned into someone i couldnt recognise. I was depressed most of the time. However, i stood strongly by my values, i am not one of those “chill girls” that can accept such behaviour and ultimately he left because he got tired of trying to meet my expectations.
When i am single i am independent, i feel happy and confident. I am not afraid to do things alone like solo travel, eat alone, go out alone, etc.
However, i just started seeing a new guy about 1.5 months ago even though i was hell bent on not trusting another guy ever again, he managed to convince me to give him a chance. I was faced with similar issues yet again, such as the guy checking out other girls in public when he is with me. That lead to me having social anxiety and not enjoying time whenever im out with him. It makes me wonder, are my standards really just too high? Am i asking for too much that no normal male can meet them? Am i the problem? We’ve had many talks and still are working through things, along with other problems we face such as culture differences and family differences, etc.
All these relationship problems have taken a toll on my mental health. I am pouring so much into this that i feel like im drowning in university. I have no energy to give to anybody else or anything else. I feel like if this continues on i am scared one day i might have to drop out. Everyone else seems to be doing well and i feel like i am the only one struggling. But i cant because i worked so hard to get to where i am today and my mum is still helping me with my fees, i cant let her down.
Moreover, i fell sick recently so the physical weakness makes me feel more tired and helpless with everything going on in my life. My mum and her tantrums flared up again and we havent been talking for a few days, normally i am not affected by this but given my current situation i do feel like i have no one by my side which is sad.
Sometimes i do think i know the answer to my problems is to cut it off with the guy, but i cant bear to do it. Why am i always holding on to the potential of something?",,1,,,,,
2228,"Relationship problems, am i normal?",https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/relationship-problems-am-i-normal/2228,Is This Normal?,---,1383,Jane,Professional,Professional,3067,2,"Hey @young1126 , thank you for reaching out and sharing your story with me. It sounds like this is a situation that is weighing heavy on your heart, and I can imagine how frustrating that can be. I’m sorry to hear that you had to endure trauma in your childhood and that it is now manifesting problems in your romantic relationships, but it is heartening to know that you are recognising the key issues and that you stand firm by your boundaries and values.
I want to firstly affirm you that what you are feeling is normal to experience in relationships, especially if you are a young person. It can take awhile to figure out what you like and dislike in a partner, and what works for you in a relationship, so I would like to encourage you to take it easy on yourself. You don’t have to have it all figured out yet.
The thing about relationships is that it is not about compromise, but rather about collaboration. A compromise would mean that both parties have to give up something in order for the relationship to work, and that would leave both of you unhappy in some regard. By contrast, a collaboration would mean that both of you can have your needs met without having to settle for anything less than you deserve.
This is not to say that there won’t be any conflicts in the relationship. There will always be disagreement as that is human nature. But when you are collaborating with your partner, it becomes less of you vs them, and more of you & them vs the problem. So I would like you to ask yourself if your current relationship feels more like a compromise or a collaboration? If you are having issues this early on in the realtionship, then perhaps this partner may not be a good fit for you. You deserve someone who is willing to work together with you and meet you at your values and boundaries without having to minimise your own needs.
I am glad to hear that you are not giving up on your studies despite what you are going through. This shows me your mental resilience and willingness to work through this ordeal. With that, I would like to encourage practicing self-care in this difficult time. Self-care goes beyond treating yourself every now and then (e.g. getting bubble tea after a tough week); it is about doing the things that are good for you, even if you do not feel like it. Some examples of self-care would include eating your meals on time, taking frequent breaks from work to recharge, practicing good sleep hygiene, and connecting with others in your social circle (apart from your partner). It can be tempting to isolate yourself but from what you mentioned, it does not seem like that is what you want.
It can be difficult to let go of something we want so desperately to work. However, it is important to accept things as they are at face value, rather than putting our hopes into something that may never happen. While we cannot control what others do, we can decide for ourselves if something is worth investing our time in. Of course, it would be great if things worked out in your favour, but we cannot let the potential of the future distract us from our current reality.
I’ll leave you with two book titles you may wish to look into:
(1) Conversations on Love by Natasha Lunn
(2) Come Home to Yourself by Deja Rae
These are excellent reads that may help provide a better perspective on the topic of love and relationships.
I hope this helps. All the best and take care! (´｡• ᵕ •｡`)",,0,,3061,,3061.0,

To add on to the message, it would also be helpful for you, @young1126 , to have a look at the following signs. Use them as a guide to help you consider whether it might be time to move on from a relationship:
2. When the relationship brings you more pain than joy. Relationships are supposed to build you up. While they might be stressful at times, on the whole, they should not be making your life more difficult.
3. When the person is causing you hurt. Emotional hurt is not visible but it is real. You mentioned that your partner was checking out on other girls even while you’re present and such behaviour left you feeling anxious and unhappy. It’s important to bring this matter to his awareness and address it together. If the same thing happens even after you have made efforts to address it, you might want to reevaluate the relationship.
4. When the person puts little to no effort in the relationship. Every relationship—be it friendships and familial bonds—requires effort by the duo. If you find yourself constantly putting in more effort than the other partner, sooner than later it will drain you. While it is possible for a one-sided relationship to last, perhaps consider if you’re prepared to do the same in the long term and if this is your ideal partner, a person who doesn’t care to invest as much effort into the relationship as you.
I hope this helps; and no matter what decision you make, know that you deserve love and respect, and to stay well. Know that when you take care of yourself, you are putting yourself in the best possible position to not just be in a happy and fulfilling romantic relationship, but also to strive in other areas of your life.

2214,A Little Taboo: Questioning Gender Identity,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/a-little-taboo-questioning-gender-identity/2214,Seeking Help,---,1599,JayHyjinx,User,,3042,1,"Since queer sexual orientation and gender identity is gradually being accepted, I’d thought I’d share my emotions for the past few weeks.
I’ve been questioning the constructs for about two to three years? I’m not quite curious about my sexuality as it doesn’t really matter in this part of my life. However, I have been questioning my gender because I haven’t been feeling like mine. In fact, I’ve tried to cut my hair short but due to my hair type, I cannot make it the way I wanted. I had a nervous breakdown about it because “If I can’t express who I am, then what’s the point of living?”. I think that rippled into a series of other nervous breakdowns about their individual topics. The latest being whether I can handle life’s challenges if I’m so upset at the moment.
Now, I’m not sure what my gender identity is, believe me I tried, but I’ve been trying to express it. It’s very difficult since I’m doing a complete 180°, I’m more comfortable in the opposite genders’ clothing and uniforms are so restricting. I haven’t told anyone much about my pronouns and stuff because I’ve told some people, and only two of them use them.
So I’ve got two questions (if you take time to read):
1. How can I express my gender in the limited places I can?
2. How do I stop my breakdowns?
To the person who does read my story and answer my questions, I appreciate you very much and thank you in advance for caring enough to concoct solutions. Thank you again. Warm love and regards from Jay.",,2,3062.0,,,,
2214,A Little Taboo: Questioning Gender Identity,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/a-little-taboo-questioning-gender-identity/2214,Seeking Help,---,194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),3062,2,"Dear @JayHyjinx,
Thank you for sharing your feelings and experiences with us. It sounds like you’ve been questioning your gender identity for some time now, and that this process has been difficult and overwhelming for you. I want you to know that we are here to support you as you navigate this journey.
I would like to affirm that it is okay to take your time in exploring and understanding yourself. Many of us go through similar periods of ambiguity at some point of time in our lives as well. You mentioned feeling like you’re doing a complete 180°, which I imagine can be confusing and disorienting. I want to assure you that there is no rush to figure things out, and that it is okay to experiment with different expressions of your gender identity until you find what feels most authentic to you.
I understand that you’ve been feeling overwhelmed and frustrated with the limited places in which you can express your gender identity. It can be difficult to find spaces that are accepting and supportive, but please know that you deserve to express yourself authentically and feel comfortable in your own skin. While it may feel challenging at first, there are ways to explore your gender expression that feel safe and affirming. You can start by experimenting with clothing and accessories that align with your gender identity in the privacy of your own home. You mentioned that you’ve tried cutting your hair short, but it didn’t turn out the way you wanted. I’m sorry to hear that. If you feel comfortable, you could consider finding a stylist who is experienced in cutting hair for different gender expressions. Meanwhile, you could experiment with different hairstyles or accessories that make you feel more comfortable and confident. You could also consider seeking out safe spaces, such as online communities or support groups, where you can connect with others who are also exploring their gender identity and receive encouragement and guidance. I encourage you to do some further reading on the topic as well - you could include the term ‘gender identity development’ as a keyword in your search.
At the same time, I want to address the tendency to overgeneralise when faced with challenges or setbacks. You mentioned having a nervous breakdown because you couldn’t express who you are through your hair, and feeling like there is no point in living if you can’t express yourself. While I can imagine that these feelings can be intense and overwhelming, it’s important to remember that your gender identity is one aspect of your identity, and that you are a multifaceted individual with varied strengths and interests. This is not to say that your gender identity is not important, but your life bears value and meaning beyond just your gender expression. While recognising that exploring your gender identity is a process that takes time and patience, we could also explore other ways to express yourself through other outlets of interest to you. Something else that could be useful when experiencing such thoughts would be thought reframing – this involves replacing distressing thoughts with more helpful ones. You can try out this guided exercise to help you do this (1).
If you find yourself struggling with intense emotions, it may be helpful to develop coping strategies to manage these feelings. This could include practicing self-care, seeking support from loved ones, or speaking to a mental health professional. You could try out this exercise to guide you in identifying and building up a network of trust and support (2). Remember that you don’t have to navigate this journey alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you. I’d also like for you to examine the way in which you speak to yourself - in such times, it is all the more important for you to extend patience and kindness towards yourself. I’m linking a self-compassion exercise for you to try out here (3).
In summary, it’s okay to feel uncertain about your gender identity, and it’s important to take your time in exploring and understanding yourself. At the same time, it’s important to recognise that your gender identity is just one aspect of your identity, and that your life has value and meaning beyond your gender identity as well. If you find yourself struggling with intense emotions, there are coping strategies and support systems available to you. Please feel free to follow-up with any further questions you may have. We are here to support you as you navigate this journey and wish you well!

Thank you for sharing your issue.
It must be very unsettling for you when the person’s words and actions are not congruent. From what I understand from you, it seemed like you are not in an exclusive relationship but only dated for a couple of months. However the guy is confusing you with his words and behaviour.
His behaviour might have left you feeling rejected and second best. You deserve to be respected and cared for and not taken as a contingent for him to fall back on in case he cannot find another girl. Relationship is two way where respect, care, communication, give and take are all important elements for it to work.
Perhaps it would be good to find a time to talk this out with him. This will allow you to know his thoughts towards this relationship and also for you to decide how you want to progress. If indeed he wants an exclusive relationship with you, it is also an opportunity to set your expectation with regards to his behaviours or attitudes towards other girls. This is a tool you could use to help you map out what you want to derive from the conversation and how to go about approaching it (1).

So the past week has been horrible because he found out that I am been volunteering and doing cca without his knowledge for the past 6 months because he doesn’t allow me to do those things even when I have told him before and even suggested things we can do together. later on he comes back with stuff he wants to do. The reason he doesn’t want me to go for cca and like events is because it makes him insecure I talk with people regardless of the gender and told me that I have cheated with him in honesty. So the other day he cried about this and I instantly laughed because how childish his actions seems and he says he wanted to die because of me going to events although I was wrong for laughing but the way I was crying and then later on slapped me(although I had said to him previously before the fight) if u feel angry u can slap. Also he gets angry if I hug a doll for example. He doesn’t want me to send off emojis like hearts to even girls story posts on social media but he goes for his school events but then asks me not to. if I question this he says I don’t lie like u and u were the one who gave me insecurity not the other way round and he gets angry I have gone to more events than me. There is so much more but I would like to limit for now. Apart from this my parents don’t allow me to have bfs and they are strict so this is all a secret and its so hard when both the sides are constantly doubting and scolding me,relationship.Me 4 http://relationship.me/,2,,,,,
2123,Just a question,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/just-a-question/2123,Seeking Help,---,1383,Jane,Professional,Professional,2903,2,"Hi @joshna12 , thank you for sharing your story with me. It sounds like you are going through a rough time in your relationship and I want to first affirm you that your feelings are valid. I can imagine how you would feel upset and frustrated from having to deal with this situation. I want to let you know that you are not in the wrong for taking part in volunteering and CCAs, or for talking to your friends and sending them heart emojis on social media. That is in your right and autonomy, and no one should be taking that away from you.
It is not your responsibility to manage someone else’s insecurity. You may care for your boyfriend very much, but that is not reason enough to justify his demands of you to not participate in events and talk to your friends. It is even more unreasonable that he is angry at you for attending more events than him and slapping you when he felt angry, regardless of what you told him before the fight.
I would like you to ask yourself if this is what you truly want out of a relationship. Do you want to be with someone who does not let you talk to your friends and does not allow you to attend activities that you enjoy? Do you want to be with someone who physically hurts you? Do you want to be with someone who accuses you of cheating when you have not done so? Do you want to be with someone who you have to be cautious around and not let him find out about the things you are doing daily?
You may wish to consider establishing some boundaries with him. Boundaries play a big part in developing healthy relationships and enhancing communication and intimacy. Some examples could be (1) no physical abuse (i.e. slapping, punching, kicking, biting, etc), (2) saying no when you do not wish to do something, (3) not taking the blame for his feelings (e.g. it is not your fault he is angry that you attended more events than him), (4) asking for space to cool down when things get a bit too heated and emotional before discussing the issue. The key here is to focus on respecting one another, building trust, understanding, honesty, and care for each other.
You deserve to feel safe and loved in a relationship. You are not ‘the bad one’ for doing the things you enjoy and wanting to talk to your friends. I encourage you to reach out to your friends and trusted adults (e.g. teachers or relatives (if you do not feel ready to tell your parents yet)) regarding this matter. You are not alone in this and having social support can help tremendously.
Do what you think is best for you, and I hope this helps. Take care („• ֊ •„)",,2,,2900,,2900.0,

Now this is just my opinion, I’m not a professional. I don’t believe it justifies his passive aggression. Personally I believe, if he’s upset about how you treat him he should be frank and communicate that with you rather than try to in a sense ‘hit you with your own medicine’ or ‘payback’ by being passive aggressive.
However, it’s indeed harmful for you to show attitude whenever you have issues because as much as possible you should try to refrain from venting your frustrations on your loved ones. In addition, his passive aggressiveness is unfortunately, from my experience, a common reaction? It’s hard to seek comfort from someone you’ve hurt because they’ll struggle to empathise with you especially if they didn’t do anything for you to hurt them.
This is what works for me but, when I’m facing issues I’d tell my partner not exactly explain the situation but just tell them something happened and give them a heads up that I can be quite irritable at the moment. But if they care to listen, when I’m ready and a bit more collected (where I’m sure I won’t vent on them) I’d recount what happened and ask for their opinion.

Thanks for sharing what you are going through in your relationship. It takes awareness and courage to be able to understand and reflect on your own situation. It does sound like you may need to have a chat with him when he is in a calm state of mind to explain how his behaviour is impacting you and your wellbeing, and also to find out why he feels that you are “showing him attitude” which seems to be his trigger point.
Open communication is an important element in a healthy relationship. It is sometimes hard for men, especially Asian men, to share their emotions as they were not brought up that way and do not have good role models. You can help him to be more aware of his own feelings and encourage him to be open with them.
I hope you will find safety and courage in speaking with him. Give yourself a timeline to assess the relationship and don’t be afraid to make any decision which is best for yourself. Lots of loving thoughts to you.",,1,,,,,

To me, what you did showed your priorities for self care which is paramount for us to lead happy and meaningful lives. It also endorses to me the qualities of a person who cares for her boyfriend, and wants to work on her relationship and move towards a better solution.
I would like to reiterate what Yoshi has accurately pointed out- that communication is very important in a healthy relationship, and would be a very good goal for you to aim for.
I hear that you are facing some challenges regarding the relationship you are in with your boyfriend, and the fights which ends in both arguments and confusion. Further, it sounds like this has been ongoing for quite awhile, and has become something of a vicious cycle.
I sense that you are nearing your wits end on what to do about the situation, and are contemplating not bringing up issues to your boyfriend to avoid further occurrences of quarrels and negative outcomes.
I am sorry that you have been through all these pain, confusion and exhaustion. Relationships, and communication as Yoshi pointed out, are never easy, and it is not abnormal to experience these.
If I may, I would like to suggest taking some time off to tend to your needs. Perhaps your favorite cafe or bookstore. Ask yourself what an ideal response you would like your boyfriend to give when you are going through a hard time. Noting your genuine concern for him, perhaps you could also ask yourself how he would prefer you to communicate to him by.
If possible, as Yoshi pointed out, would you ask your boyfriend for a heart-to-heart talk about both of your wishes? It would allow you to express gratitude that he does attend to you when you go through a difficult moment, but that you would prefer if he responded in a particular manner as it is important to you, and that you consider his wellbeing a priority and want to understand his point of view too; that you might be a better, more loving girlfriend to him.
To end off, I would like to thank you once again, and highlight the importance of communication as it would bring the both of you closer in love and understanding, and resolve some of the uncertainties as you have pointed out- being too sensitive of if you are being ill-treated.
Please feel free to reply if you have any concerns or questions, or updates to your situation if you require more help or a listening ear.

It has been 8 years since I started getting help and doing my best to heal/ get better but it’s been extremely hard to carry on like this due to budget constraints. I had to stop multiple times because I simply do not have the money and working has been very challenging at times as I am very mentally unwell most days and now, I have gone back to school in order to get a more stable career in the future and it is really hard to balance work and school. I have stopped my medication abruptly too.
Home life is not the most stable and through talking to many professionals, it is apparently the root of my issues. However I cannot move out despite the psychiatrist and social worker’s suggestion because I do not have the money. I also value my relationship with my family and don’t want to damage their reputation amongst their friends and family despite them doing very bad things to me when I was a child. I feel so torn.
I keep trying to solve my issues but it seems as though everytime I try to help myself, I become more and more mentally unwell. This is why I attempted suicide last year. I felt that no matter how hard I try, people around keep telling me I’m not trying hard enough and that it’s all my fault and following their methods made me feel insane. I know it’s my fault but I’m really trying and it never is enough.
The thing that really helped was my therapist and seeing her everyweek for a month helped me so so so much. I went broke doing that so it became 1 session the next month and then i stopped just after another session. I saw a psychologist at a public hospital after my attempt but was so shocked that my bill was around $141 and the resolution given was exactly what my first school counsellor gave to me when I was much younger and it does not really work at all.
I do not depend on my parents for help except for the attempt but the more money I borrow from them, the more debt I have, financially and emotionally.
Currently my school counsellor is so nice and caring but I’m so afraid to talk about other topics apart from school and some issues from home. I really want to see my old therapist again because I think she works the best for me and continue taking my medication as well but I feel so stuck with the financial aspect of it.",,2,2811.0,,,,

I’d firstly like to thank you for your courage in sharing these struggles with us. I can imagine how difficult it must be to be faced with all these challenges, especially when it feels like you’re constantly trying to solve your issues but you don’t feel like you’re getting anywhere. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot in the past 8 years, including trying different forms of therapy and medication, all within the context of the financial constraints you’ve mentioned. You also mentioned the added stress of balancing work and school, and being stuck in a difficult home situation. It’s completely understandable that you feel torn and helpless right now.
Please know that you are not alone and we are here to support you. Your perseverance and determination to get better, despite the obstacles in your way, is truly commendable. I admire your strength and resilience and I’d like you to know that you deserve to receive the care and support that you need. I want to also affirm that it’s okay to ask for help, including financial support if necessary.
The first point I would like to address is what you had mentioned about your relationship with the school counsellor you are currently seeing and your desire to see your previous therapist instead. I can imagine how difficult and tiring it can be to open up and be vulnerable with a new therapist, especially when you have found comfort and some level of success with your previous one. It takes time to build rapport and perhaps we could start by letting the counsellor you are presently seeing know about your concerns in opening up and your preference for your previous therapist. This would allow him or her to explore the reasons behind the fear that you have towards speaking openly about other issues besides school, so that you can work towards moving onto establishing and working on therapeutic goals that are valuable to you. The therapeutic relationship is one that is built on trust and honesty, and your counsellor can only help if you are willing to share your thoughts and feelings.
If you do decide that you are keen to explore other options for therapy, you can have a look at this list (1) or consider mental health support services provided by non-profit organisations. Here are a couple you may wish to consider: Limitless , Impart , IASH . Do note that some of these are volunteer-led.
I can imagine that the conflict between wanting to work on your mental health and thinking about the financial implications (in the form of both money and time) of this could result in feelings of guilt, especially if this means involving your parents in some way. However, remember that seeking help and taking care of your mental health is a brave and important step, not just for yourself but also for your loved ones and the people around you. For this reason, when you attend your counselling/therapy sessions, I’d like you to try and focus on the present moment and what you hope to gain from these sessions. Setting specific and realistic goals for therapy, such as managing stress and difficult emotions or improving relationships could help in naturally shifting this focus.
You also mentioned that you had abruptly stopped taking your medications. I’m wondering if this was a result of the financial situation that you are in or if there were other reasons such as side-effects involved? Regardless, I would encourage you to speak to the psychiatrist that had been prescribing you the medication regarding your concerns and see if there are options for financial support or, if side-effects were the main factor in stopping your medication, a dosage or a different medication that might be better suited for you.
In the meantime and in between sessions, here are a couple of things you could try out to help you cope:
- Given practical constraints as you balance school and work among other commitments, you may find it challenging to carve out time for hobbies that you used to enjoy. While I strongly encourage you to try to schedule bits of time in between commitments to engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, I understand that it may not always be easy to do so. A time-efficient way in which you could give yourself a break is by practicing mindfulness through meditation, deep breathing, or mindful movements that can help you stay in the present moment and reduce stress and anxiety. Here is a page with various tools and guided exercises that you could try out (2).
- Try to shift the focus from self-criticism to self-care. I hear that you have been trying your utmost best to take care of yourself and improve your mental health, but despite your efforts, you still feel like they are never enough. I want you to know that it’s understandable to feel this way and that self-compassion can be a powerful tool in helping you manage these thoughts and feelings. Self-compassion involves treating yourself with kindness and understanding, rather than criticising and blaming yourself. Instead of denying or trying to suppress your struggles and/or difficult emotions, try gently acknowledging these. Know that we all make mistakes and have limitations. Instead of saying “I’m such a failure”, we could try to use positive self-talk to replace self-critical thoughts. In your case, for example, you could instead say “I am doing my best and that is enough”. This may feel effortful and perhaps rather awkward at the start, but consciously practicing self-compassion will help you develop a more accepting and understanding relationship with yourself over time. This exercise (3) teaches us how to take the power out of difficult sticky thoughts and could help you get started. You could also use this worksheet (4) to guide you through designing self-affirmations that are impactful for you. Writing these affirmations down would give you something to refer to in the future and serve as a good reminder whenever self-critical thoughts arise.
Lastly, I would like to end off by once again reaffirming your strength and efforts in trying your best over the past 8 years, despite the challenges you’ve encountered along the way. As human beings, we have the tendency to zoom in on the negatives. But I’d like you to also recognise the progress you have made and remember that no accomplishment is too small to be celebrated. Know that it’s okay to not have everything figured out right now and that you are not alone in your struggles. At the end of the day, recovery is a journey and not a destination. Let’s work on being gentle and patient with yourself in this journey. Hope is always present for as long as you’re willing to give yourself a chance, and things can get better with time and effort.

2072,Coping with school,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/coping-with-school/2072,Seeking Help,---,1383,Jane,Professional,Professional,2746,2,"Hey @ys20, thank you for sharing with me about how you are feeling. I hear you - school can get pretty hectic and overwhelming at times and it feels like you’re the only one falling behind. I want to assure you that you are not alone in this and what you are feeling is very normal. Here are some ideas that may help with managing your incomplete tasks and ease your feelings:
2. Break down your tasks and prioritise them. Whether you choose to prioritise your assignments by the due date or by the amount of time you need to complete it, breaking them down into smaller tasks can help things seem much more manageable and help you focus on one thing at a time.
3. List those smaller tasks down onto a to-do list that you can check off when you are done. The reason for this is every time we complete a task, our brains release dopamine which causes positive feelings like happiness and motivation. The checklist is a visual representation of the tasks that you have already completed and it helps you stay on track on what needs to be done next. Here is a checklist tool that you may wish to try out (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Workplace Mental Health | mindline.sg )
4. Figure out what are your productive hours. Everyone is wired differently - some work best at night when it’s quiet while others work best early in the morning when they wake up. Try to allocate your most challenging tasks to the hours you feel most productive, and leave the smaller, easier tasks to when you don’t feel like working as much.
5. Take frequent breaks and reward yourself! It is important to take care of yourself especially during exam or submission season. Whether it’s taking a 5min break for every 30min that you work, or treating yourself to some bubble tea when you’re done with an assignment - remember that rest is productive and essential for us to keep going.
6. Talk to your peers about how you feel. Chances are that you’re not the only one who is feeling stressed out about your assignments. Sharing how you feel with others and learning where your peers are at on their to-do list could help you feel less alone in your journey.
Here is a productivity tool you may wish to try out when you’re having a hard time focusing (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Workplace Mental Health | mindline.sg) and a positivity exercise if you need a dopamine kick (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Workplace Mental Health | mindline.sg).

Firstly, I want to let you know that your feelings of guilt are very normal. We tend to feel guilty when we spend money on things we don’t need, especially if it is an impulse buy. And while impulse shopping is not necessarily something to be ashamed of, it can make for an unhealthy coping mechanism.
I hear from what you shared that you tend to impulsively spend money when you are feeling stressed. Often when we do something out of impulse due to feeling stressed, it is because we are feeling a lack of control over the stressful situation. Making purchases not only provide us with a boost of happy chemicals in our brains, but also a sense of control to compensate for how we are feeling. As such, it might be worth exploring what you are stressed over and figuring out how you can overcome that situation, which would in turn help reduce the urge to spend impulsively.
In the meantime, here are some things we can do to prevent shopping impulsively:
2. Have a reasonable shopping budget and stick to it. This can be a weekly or monthly budget - whatever works for you! The important thing is that you stay disciplined with it and not overspend. Setting a budget will help you stick within your means of spending without completely cutting yourself off from the things you enjoy. Whenever you feel the urge to buy something, consider if it is within your budget and if you will have enough money leftover to buy other things.
3. Set a 48h decision rule. When you want to buy something - hold off on making the purchase for at least 48h. If, and only, after 48h you still want to make the purchase (and it is within budget!) - go for it. This rule can help you decide if something is truly worth buying or if it’s just another impulsive ‘want’ in the moment.
4. Be accountable. Let your family or friends know that you working on cutting down impulsive spending and have them check in on you. This could be in the form of weekly or fortnightly check-ins to make sure you are staying on track with your goal. If you are going shopping in person, consider inviting someone who knows about your plan to go with you.
5. Seek other methods to relieve stress. Exercising, dancing, journaling, or any other hobbies you might have are all greats alternatives to shopping you could try.
I would also like to share some tools you may find useful. Here is one for working towards your goals (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Workplace Mental Health | mindline.sg ), and one for quick stress relief (Mental Support & Wellbeing Resources in Singapore to Improve Workplace Mental Health | mindline.sg ).

I understand that the transition from Secondary School to Poly can be challenging and maintaining a balance between stuff could be exhausting as well. This can sometimes create a lot of confusion with regards to our needs and wants, which is what I’m hearing from you.
Do ask yourself these questions:
2. Am I at the stage where I feel burnt out doing these stuff?
3. Do I feel satisfied after completing these stuff?
It may also be helpful for you to list the pros and cons of taking up a particular activity - this may give you a better idea of whether you will be able to find meaning and sustain your interest in doing it. Having a physical list could also serve as a reminder of why you had made that particular decision if you start to have second thoughts in the future.
Next you mentioned about trying to keep up the reputation that you uphold and this could be daunting knowing that you’ve placed such a strong emphasis on meeting your goals. This may lead you to feeling fearful of not achieving the goal set and therefore could make yourself feel uneasy and worried.
I’m extremely glad that you’re reminding yourself that self-care is very important. However, I also hear that you fear falling back into the cycle when you see an event that would potentially interest you. I would like to tell you that while self-care may sometimes be about reducing the number of things we decide to put on our plate - especially when your plate is overwhelmed at the expense of your basic needs being met, it can also be about creating spaces of time to re-energise yourself in between these responsibilities.
In the case that the opportunity to partake in such events arises, something you could think about is what it would mean for you to feel a great sense of achievement with the confidence that you have to manage these meaningful events while at the same time taking the necessary steps to practise self-care. Do remember that you also have family, friends and loved ones to rely on and they can be beneficial in your mental well-being.
Here are some suggestions on what we can do to manage self-doubt and to help us set boundaries :
Develop New Routine (1) -
2. We can learn to use time management strategies to help us manage our time and take frequent breaks. On taking breaks, Dr. Gabija Toleikyte, a neuroscientist, recommends that the number of breaks required depends on the complexity of the task. Also, the frequency and duration of breaks need to be tailored to your case. She recommends a 10 minute break every hour and a half in the morning and increasing the frequency to a 10-minute break every hour after lunch.
You can read more about her work on the neuroscience of motivation here (2)
2. Get enough sleep
3. Prioritise self-care and time with friends and family
Develop New Habits (3) -
2. Write a list of as many benefits of changing that habit as we can
3. Write down a list of negative consequences now and in the long term if we don’t change it
4. Seek clarity, visualise the future we want to build, and make small changes - The more vividly we can imagine the future we are trying to build, the more it stimulates our reward centres and the easier it is to resist the habits that get in the way.
4. You can take time to reflect and ask yourself these questions:
• What would you like to do?
• What would you like to look like and feel like?
• What experiences would you like to have and who would you like to share them with?
5. Next, ask yourself these questions:
• What one thing would I like to change this month?
• Is that “one thing” achievable? Otherwise, what is the “good enough” standard
• What could I do this week towards it?
• What small step could I take this week to make this action possible?
6. Act on the one thing you want to achieve!
Set healthy boundaries (4) -
2. Recognise your limits
2.Learn to say “no” to others or attending events when your plates are full and when you need a break.

It’s entirely possible that you both enjoy taking up things and you also like maintaining your reputation, I think it’s amazing that you’ve clearly reflected on this a lot and you have high awareness to be able to point out what the issue is.
I do believe you are doing enough by practicing self care and prioritizing your mental well-being, I think the fact you’re scared to fall back into the cycle already proves that you will be careful not to! :> Just make sure that when you do take up events, you consider what else you have going on and to leave lots and lots of free time (because unexpected situations do occur)

You mentioned that you’ve reached out to other charity organisations, but haven’t heard back from them. I’m wondering how long it’s been since you reached out to them?

Sounds like you are feeling very overwhelmed trying to balance your school work and finding time to connect with friends and family.
Often when we have too many tasks on hand we can become anxious, which in turn makes the situation worse as anxiety will cloud our thought process. One way is to find a time to relax yourself when you feel overwhelmed or stress and anxious. Guided breathing exercises can be a quick and effective way to help you do so - you can try the breathing exercises in this link to help you relax. https://mindline.sg/youth?wysa_tool_id=breathe_deeply
Thinking about doing everything you need to do all at once can also be overwhelming. Try breaking it down to smaller tasks so that it’s more manageable. You can prioritise and manage your time and school work- Usually when we make a conscious effort to sit down and plan, we actually find that we have more time than we think and this will allow you to have more time to connect socially and have some fun.

We started to develop feelings for each other and dated last year and broke up this year in March.
He told me to wait for him for 2-4 years and I said okay.
So we remain as being good friends but all my text and affection for him are still the same as if I was still his girlfriend.
I guess i wasn’t ready to be friends.
2 days a go we met up with our other friends and friend I introduced us to one of his female friend name M
M was pretty, kind and smart.
Friend I mentioned that M has helped him in his studies and felt very grateful for her.
When friend I introduce to us to M I can see that friend I gives lots of attention to her and ask her if M wants any food he can help to buy for her and more.
I find this odd as his other female friends also help him in other subjects im school but he was only concern to M the most?
I felt very uncomfortable (jealousy) which leads me to be very mad at him even though he had done nothing wrong
So I texted him at night being straightforward
If he still likes me as I would like to know if I am still going to wait for the 2-4 years thinking we are going to have a chance.
He said that he no longer likes me and wants to focus more on himself
So now all this time I felt foolish and humiliated for being like a girlfriend while he only really sees me as a friend.
He kept saying “let’s see what we plan for the future”
I was still mad at him and said there won’t be any future, I feel like a fool, I wasted so much time expecting something was going to happen.
And told him it was best not to contact each other anymore (or else we are gonna keep hurting each other)
He was my best friend and a lover who I was able to depend on.
Now I have a big feeling of regret saying not to contact each other or is either i am just missing him.
I do not know what to do
I feel like I should text him again but few days later on but I do not know what to say.

1816,I regret losing my best friend,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-regret-losing-my-best-friend/1816,Seeking Help,"needadvice, mentalhealth, emotions, gethelp, letstalkaboutit, selfcare, bekind, ruokay",194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),2319,2,"Dear @colette, I would firstly like to commend and thank you for your openness and courage in sharing your story with us here on this platform. Matters of the heart are never straightforward and I imagine that navigating the layers of emotions arising from these recent series of events can get really overwhelming.
I’m assuming that by the time you’re reading this, a couple of days would’ve passed since the last time you’d spoken to friend I. I’m wondering if your emotions have changed in any way since then? Being social creatures, the relationships that we form with others tend to make up a big portion of our identity and the way in which we perceive ourselves. As a result, when we lose any of these relationships, especially ones that are of great value to us, we may experience the process of grief. This process of grief may take you through different phases – for example, you may initially find yourself being desperate for answers, before moving into a state of denial and anger. You may read more on the stages of grief here (1). These stages may not necessarily take place in a linear manner. Eventually, our goal ideally is for the grief to bring you to a place of acceptance and redirected hope. It is important to bear in mind, however, that this process can happen at vastly different paces for different individuals. I’d like for you to know that it is okay to take it at your own pace. There are times in which it may feel like the grief will last forever but know that there are healthy ways to cope that will help these feelings dissipate over time.
Before I share some coping strategies with you, I’d like to tell you that all the emotions you mentioned feeling in the process are valid – you mentioned that you felt humiliated, foolish, and at some point jealous, when you noticed friend I paying close attention to M. Given the close relationship you had with friend I and the way things had ended between the two of you, it’s only natural that such feelings would come up. From what you’ve shared, it sounds like there had been a fair bit of ambiguity when the two of you had previously decided to end the relationship – perhaps this had allowed you to harbour some hope for a future with friend I still, despite the romantic relationship ending. It sounds like the recent situation has forced you to confront this sense of hope, and this is bound to cause a lot of discomfort.
Here are a couple of things you could try out and some reminders to help you cope in this time:
1. Identify your feelings and embrace them
As hard as it may be to accept, it is not possible for us to avoid the pain of loss. Attempts to ignore or suppress what you’re feeling are only likely to prolong the grieving process, and possibly cause you to even get stuck in it. I’d like for you to try to identify everything that you may be feeling, and allow yourself the space to experience them. Doing this may be quite straightforward when it comes to less consequential events, but for more impactful events such as this one, it can take a while to do so. Take some time to try and really think about what you’re feeling. Identifying our feelings allows us to acknowledge and accept that we are feeling these emotions. Before we can brush ourselves off and pick ourselves up, it’s important for us to acknowledge the hurt and not to rush through this process – however counterintuitive this may feel. You may use this emotion wheel (2) to help you. If you find your emotions getting too overwhelming, you may also wish to try out this guided meditation exercise to help you cultivate the strength and awareness to accept any difficult emotions that may arise with greater mental resilience (3).
2. Air your thoughts and feelings
Talking about your feelings related to the loss of the relationship is an equally powerful tool to manage them. As we share our feelings with trusted sources of support, we may be able to come to new understandings and relieve some of our pain. Realistically speaking, as you would’ve seen based on the stages of grief, losing contact with someone who was such a significant part of your life will never be an easy change for anyone to come to terms with. It might take some time for you to come to a sense of true acceptance, but know that you don’t have to take the steps towards this sense of acceptance on your own. Speaking to others in such times may also give us comfort by reinforcing that our feelings are normal, and that others have survived such feelings as well. If you need some guidance in identifying trusted sources of support, you can try out this exercise (4).
Having said that, people may not always be available when you need to let out your thoughts and feelings, or you may deem some of these as being too private to be shared with others. In such cases, you may wish to try penning them down instead by journaling. Here are some journaling prompts to guide you along as you reflect (5).
3. Avoid personalising the loss
In the process of reflecting the end of a relationship, it is easy to fall into the endless trap of pointing fingers at yourself or the other party for the way things turned out. Much of the pain arising from the end of a relationship comes from perceiving the loss as being your fault and regretting the choices you made while having been in the relationship. Instead of personalising the loss, it may be far more helpful to look at the end of the relationship as resulting from conflicting needs and incompatibilities that are neither your nor friend I’s fault in particular. Each individual in a relationship is trying to get their own needs met, and some couples are able to help fulfil each other’s needs while others may not. One of the biggest issues in relationships is communicating these needs and negotiating them. This is something that requires a lot of experience to learn, so try not to blame yourself and redirect the focus instead to thinking about what you can takeaway from this experience.
You may also find yourself succumbing to ruminative/negative thoughts more easily if your basic needs are not being met. It is important, more than ever, to take care of yourself in this time. Try to make sure that your basic self-care needs are met, even though this may be especially difficult in the presence of overwhelming emotions. You may not feel like eating but try to find ways to help you do this anyways – for instance, by scheduling meals with the sources of support that you’ve identified. Give yourself sufficient time to sleep as well – sleep deprivation may compound the impact of grief. You may wish to try listening to this sleep story when in bed if you are struggling to fall asleep (6).
Making decisions can be especially difficult when your mind is clouded with too many thoughts and/or you’re feeling overwhelmed. I hope engaging in some of these strategies will provide some comfort and give you some clarity as to what steps you’d like to take next. Feel free to share your experience after trying any of these out. Take care!

Thank you for having the courage to share :>> I’m not a professional so I’m not sure if this would help but this is just my opinion.
I don’t think you losing your best friend was your fault. It just happened. When the both of you became a thing, you already became something more and when you broke it off, I think by then the ‘best friendship’ was already lost.
I think you already have a feeling he likes ‘M’. There’s nothing wrong with feeling jealous especially since you like him and how he told you to wait for him. You did well for staying loyal and patiently waiting for him.
I do think it was a mistake to treat him as a boyfriend when it was clear that both of you have broken up but he was also in the wrong for giving you false hope by telling you to wait and making you expect something when he already seemed to have moved on. I think you did a great job and I’m proud you immediately took steps to take care of yourself by cutting off contact.
In the future, I hope you aren’t so hard on yourself for loving him. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be loved by who you love. Stay strong, I know you feel tempted because you miss how it was but I really don’t think you should reach out to him. (and again I’m not a professional, these are just my opinions and I may be wrong but I really hope this helped you in any way :>)",,5,,,,,

I try to keep myself occupied but it doesn’t seem to help. whenever I try to rest or sleep, my chest feels tight and I have an uneasy feeling in me. I tried talking to my parents but it only helped a little. I know death is inevitable and that we have no way of knowing what will happen to us after it. it’s part of life but some part of me just feels anxious.

1788,I keep thinking about death,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-keep-thinking-about-death/1788,Is This Normal?,---,194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),2286,2,"Hi @zn06, I’d like to thank you for your courage in sharing this with me. I hear that you’ve been struggling with anxiety lately. I imagine that having your mind plagued with thoughts surrounding death can truly be a scary place to be at. I’m glad that you had taken the initiative to share these thoughts with your parents and that it alleviated these feelings at least a little. Death is one of the few things that we all have in common, yet ironically, our fears surrounding it can make us feel terribly alone. I’d like for you to know that we’ve all probably been confronted by some level of anxiety surrounding our mortality at one point or another. You’re right, despite knowing that death is something that will inevitably touch all of us, it is surrounded by a lot of ambiguity that can be very anxiety-inducing.
To some extent, not wanting to die is a rational fear. In fact, this fear could even be constructive – it prompts us to ponder upon the question of whether we’re living a life that we value and enjoy in the present. However, it is when this fear becomes so invasive that it paralyses us and adversely affects our day-to-day that it has probably become irrational. The latter sounds like what you’ve been experiencing recently. I’d like to share some things that could be helpful in coping with this sense of death anxiety that you’ve been struggling with. Afterall, at the end of the day, we don’t want the anxiety surrounding death to become debilitating and to keep us from being able to live fully in the present.
1. Acknowledge the reality of death
Generally, coping with the sense of anxiety surrounding death by avoiding reminders or suppressing related thoughts may not be the most effective in the long-term, although it may seem to work in the short-term. What you could do instead is to consider occasionally approaching the idea, instead of completely avoiding it. Whenever reminders or thoughts related to death come up, try to allow yourself to remain in the situation and allow whatever thoughts and emotions that may arise come to pass. We know that thoughts pop into our heads all the time, but we don’t usually pay any special attention to all of them – and we realise that they then come to leave our minds all on their own. Certain thoughts, however, may be a little more intrusive – they have a strong emotional pull to them that may make it difficult for us to disengage and let them pass. For example, if we’re feeling anxious, we may find ourselves becoming more fixated on worrying thoughts, which then creates a feedback loop. Thus, if we can learn to just watch these thoughts and allow them to pass by rather than engaging with them, then we would be able to let them go as freely as any other thought that we don’t typically pay too much attention to.
Whenever a thought enters your mind, imagine placing it on a cloud that’s floating by. Try not to judge the thoughts nor label them – try to simply observe them as they drift away. This may require a lot of practice, but over time, you will be able to trust that you can handle these thoughts and feelings without having to suppress or escape them. You can read more on this here (1). You could also try out this guided relaxation exercise to help you relax your muscles progressively whenever your chest starts to feel tight or when you find yourself having trouble falling asleep (2).
2. Reflect on the value of the present
There are many ways in which we can interpret the awareness of the reality of life. Knowledge of the fact that life is finite and there being no certainty with regards to what happens after can be terrifying, but it can also serve as a reminder of the preciousness of the present. You might have noticed that people often tend to make dramatic changes to aspects of their life when they are confronted with news of impending death – they tend to realign their priorities in life, make the effort to communicate more with their loved ones, and approach life in general with renewed energy. However, we do not necessarily have to be confronted with news of a terminal illness or of impending death in order to start thinking about the values that are important to us. Generally, possessing the sense that one’s life is meaningful allows us to live with the awareness of death without perpetually fearing it. Ask yourself: what are the values that matter to you? You could use this worksheet (3) to help you with this. As you shift your focus from anticipating what’s to come to the present and start to devote your energy towards living a life that’s of value to you, you should start to notice the sense of death anxiety diminishing over time.
If you notice the physical manifestations of the anxiety (such as the chest tightness you’ve mentioned) getting worse or more frequent over time, and it starts to affect your ability to carry out your daily activities, I would urge you to approach your school counsellor or a mental health professional of your choice to work through the anxiety with you. If you’re not sure where to go, you could refer to this page for a list of services you may wish to reach out to (4).
The resources I’ve mentioned in this reply are linked below. Hopefully some of these will be able to help you through this difficult time. Please feel free to follow up with questions if you need any clarifications. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.

I feel sad all of a sudden recalling things that make me frustrated. for instance, I felt useless because I cannot play archery well compared to my friends and was afraid of them judging me, I go crazy and mad at myself when I’m late to school even if it was my first time. One time, I cried badly for someone putting a neutral rating on my work in poly even though they accidentally did it. I feel stressed about these small issues and I don’t want that feeling to get me every day. It’s suffocating. I think I’m weak-willed and most of the time I get through this frustration by increasing my faith spiritually, listening to music and do blogging. How do I get over these small issues? It gives me anger issues that I would either vent my anger to someone else or keep myself really quiet till someone notices. I feel very inferior to myself.",,2,,,,,
1762,i feel scared.,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-feel-scared/1762,Is This Normal?,---,194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),2255,2,"Dear @passiongirl, I’d like to firstly thank you for coming forward and sharing your feelings with me. It sure does sound like you’re going through a lot of emotions at the moment. I’d like to let you know that it’s okay to let out your feelings every once in a while, and if that means getting in a good cry for you, then by all means. We all need an outlet for our emotions and this can take many different forms.
You realising that you’ve been easily irritable and taking the initiative to manage this is a great start. Often, sweating the small stuff can be an indication of something bigger that’s underlying the stress and frustration. Here are a couple of things that you could do to help you better manage these stressors:
1. Identify your triggers.
I’m wondering if there’s a common theme between the situations that trigger these emotions in you? Perhaps you could start by thinking about what it was in these situations that evoked such feelings within you – was it a sense of criticism, or maybe a fear of evaluation? Also consider if you had been sleep-deprived or hungry in these situations. Sometimes, a general lack of self-care could make us more easily ticked off by things that would have probably seemed small otherwise. If you are able to identify what had triggered you in these situations and get a better sense of the circumstances surrounding these triggers, you could then work on managing yourself better when similar situations arise in the future. Try to take note of the thoughts in your mind in these situations. You could then evaluate these thoughts by asking questions such as, “Is there substantial evidence for my thought?” and “Is there evidence contrary to my thought?”. You may refer to this worksheet (1) for a detailed template to do this. Importantly, I’d like for you to try to look back at these situations from the lens of learning from such experiences, rather than to punish yourself for reacting the way that you had.
2. Practice self-compassion
From your brief sharing, it sounds like you place pretty high expectations on yourself. While this is important to some extent to motivate us to become better versions of ourselves, being overly critical of ourselves can have very detrimental effects on our mental well-being. Sometimes, when we impose high expectations on ourselves and we feel like we fall short of meeting these expectations, the sense of anger towards ourselves could manifest as anger and frustration with others. If you feel like this is something you can relate to, then I’d like to share the notion of self-compassion with you. Self-compassion is the idea of accepting yourself for who you are and coming to terms with the fact that you are a work in progress, with strengths and weaknesses. I’d like you to take a step back and think about the way that you speak to yourself. You may refer to this post (2) for more resources and exercises to help you be more gentle with yourself. We also have a mindfulness-based directed self-compassion exercise here that you could try (3).
3. Practice self-care
Sometimes, when we’re not taking care of ourselves, we can become cranky and very easily triggered by every little thing. I can imagine how tiring it can get to be devoting your energy to multiple things simultaneously – school work, archery, and your personal life, just to name a few. It is important, however, to bear in mind that you cannot give from an empty cup. This self-care assessment worksheet (4) might allow you to get a rough sensing of whether a lack of self-care could have been contributing to the emotions that you’ve been feeling and give you some inspiration on other self-care activities that you could incorporate into your daily life. You mentioned that you’ve been blogging – that’s great, writing can be a great way to help you process your emotions! You could consider referring to these self-care journaling prompts (5) that you could use when writing your posts to help you better understand your needs.
If you find yourself struggling to process these feelings and thoughts on your own, or the frequency of outbursts increases, I would advise you to approach your school counsellor or a mental health Professional to speak about this at greater length. Meanwhile, I hope this gives you some idea of what you can do to manage the emotions that you’ve been experiencing. The resources are linked below. Please take care of yourself and stay safe.

1753,How to keep your life together?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/how-to-keep-your-life-together/1753,Seeking Help,---,420,Salty_Kidd0,User,,2237,1,"I feel nervous and anxious about the new 2nd semester that happened recently, and I’ve not been able to make friends with my classmates as they have treated me differently like not so friendly unlike how they treated my other classmates which were lovely and pleasant, and fun, but there are multiple voices and thoughts telling me that I am right that they don’t like me and also wrong that I should just speak up to them, basically like an inner war. But I lost my sense of wanting to socialize with people when I started semester 1. This caused me to lose potential friendships that I could have made during 1st semester. I wish I could just go back and just fix my mistakes so that I don’t have to beat myself up for making foolish mistakes like this. I wish I could just ignore the voices in my head and what my classmates think like what my counselor says so that I could focus more on my work but I can’t help but overthink the reasons why they are acting like that.
I am also feeling overwhelmed as I can’t help to compare myself to others. I know it’s wrong and I shouldn’t compare myself as there are some things that are not within our control but I just can’t help it. I just want to be accepted by others, I want someone to tell me that “I did good” when I’ve done my best. I want to be like those people who have their life together striving in life and have friends by their side. But, I don’t think I could do it as I have had intrusive and negative thoughts that appear as long as I breathe for the past 4 years which made me be suicidal until today. I hope this makes sense and sorry if it looks like it doesn’t make sense and the points are all jumbled up.",,0,2238.0,,,,
1753,How to keep your life together?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/how-to-keep-your-life-together/1753,Seeking Help,---,194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),2238,2,"Hi @Salty_Kidd0, thank you for sharing your struggles with me. I’m glad that you’ve taken this step to reach out. It sounds like you’ve been having a lot on your mind and that all of these things have been taking a toll on you.
Adjusting to changes can be a real challenge for sure! A new semester probably entails new classes and new classmates as well - all of these things could force you to get out of your comfort zone. While there may be little to none that can be done right now about your previous semester, the good news is that you can take this opportunity to start your 2nd semester a little differently.
Firstly, I’d like to address the intrusive and negative thoughts you mentioned you’ve been having for the past 4 years. It sounds like you are presently already in touch with a counsellor. Because of the nature of this platform, I would advise you to speak with your counsellor in greater depth about these thoughts. If you have any active self-harming or suicidal thoughts, I would also urge you to approach your counsellor or contact SOS at 1-767, or IMH at 63892222 immediately.
In the meantime, there are a few things that I could perhaps share with you. I’m hearing that you’ve been having conflicting thoughts regarding your classmates and the way that they think about you. I’m wondering if there are certain things they say or do to make you feel that they don’t like you? Could there perhaps be an alternative interpretation of such situations? To expand a little on this, I’d like to share with you about the way our thoughts, feelings, and actions are connected. Here is a simple example:
Situation: My friend hasn’t spoken to me as much as she usually does over the last week.
Thought: My friend hasn’t talked to me much this week. She must be angry at me.
Feeling: Sad and hurt.
Action: I ignored my friend and avoided her in school because I was upset.
In this situation, you see how your interpretation of the situation can affect the way you feel and the way you act in response. Sometimes, this may eventually result in the occurrence of a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can read more about this here (1).
Applied to your situation, is there perhaps a different interpretation of things? Are there new thoughts that may help you see the situation differently? You may refer to this worksheet (2) to read more about how changing our thoughts can also change our feelings and actions.
Another point I would like to address is the point you brought up about not being able to stop comparing yourself to others. As inherently social creatures, we’re probably all guilty of engaging in social comparison at some point in our lives. Not all forms of comparisons are bad either - to some extent, social comparisons can motivate us to become better versions of ourselves. However, too much of it can quickly become destructive and unproductive.
You shared that you’d like to be like those people who have their life together, striving in life and having friends by their side.
Here’s what we can do to steer away from comparing ourselves to others:
1. Be mindful of the situations and stimuli that may trigger such comparisons
For example, is it something that happens frequently while scrolling through social media? If this is the case, then perhaps we can work on trying to reduce screen time, or identifying specific accounts that may make you feel a certain way and choosing to mute/unfollow them. It is also important for us to bear in mind that most of the time, what we see on social media is merely a highlight reel, and there are also probably less glamorous aspects of these people’s lives that don’t show up.
2. Practice gratitude, and focus on your own growth.
The fact of the matter is that there will always be someone out there who is doing better - and worse, for that matter - than you in some aspect or another, because none of us are perfect in all areas. In the process of engaging in social comparison, we sometimes end up losing sight of the wonderful things we have in life as our focus is locked on the things that we wished we had. Something that you could try would be gratitude journaling by writing down 3 things you’re grateful for every day, or our gratitude exercise (3) to help you incorporate more gratitude into your daily life.
I hope some of these will be of help to you. Please take care of yourself and keep yourself safe! I’ve linked the resources below, for your reference.

725,Forgiveness,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/forgiveness/725,Seeking Help,"needadvice, mentalhealth, selfhelp, bekind",121,Cole,User,,1195,1,"Hi all, I have been feeling really lost lately. There are lots of things happening right now in my life. I have some problems facing people and kept drowning myself in self-guilt and self-pity. Mostly, it is due to me being unforgiving to myself.
As mentioned, I find it hard to forgive myself and move on - I realized this lately. Recently, I have been thinking about why I feel this way. The only conclusion is that I’m too hard on myself. I have high expectations of myself.
Recently, I have made lots of mistakes. Too many to count. I understand that there is no point in crying over spilt milk. It is okay to make mistakes in life and I learned from it. However, I kept replaying the scenes in my mind of the mistake(s) that was made. I was annoyed. Frustrated. Vexed. Moreover, with the addition of the fear of being judged, it made me more on guard and more reserved when facing the people around me. And after much thought, I realized something. I’m not scared of making mistakes. I’m afraid of people.
So, I would like to seek help on how I can forgive myself. Not just a distraction, but to just move on and not drown myself in all the mistakes that were made.",,2,1196.0,,,,
725,Forgiveness,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/forgiveness/725,Seeking Help,"needadvice, mentalhealth, selfhelp, bekind",194,YuanYang,User,Professional (Moderator),1196,2,"Hi @Cole , we apologise for the belated response. Thank you for reaching out! It takes courage to share how you’ve been feeling at such length. I hear from your sharing that you’ve been having difficulties with self-forgiveness, and this contributes towards the sense of apprehension about being around others, as you’re afraid of making mistakes and being judged for them. I can imagine that it must be tough trying to navigate all of this on your own. I’m glad that you’ve taken the first step of penning this down and coming forward to share it with us.
I would like to share about the idea of self-compassion with you. Self-compassion is the idea of accepting yourself for who you are, imperfections and all. It’s about coming to an understanding that you are a work in progress, with strengths and weaknesses, and knowing that that’s okay.
For a lot of us, showing compassion to others may be relatively simple. We try our best to respond to family, friends, pets, and even strangers with kindness and understanding, even when they make mistakes. However, the story might change a little when we try to apply this to ourselves. Many compassionate people can be highly critical and unforgiving of themselves when they hold themselves to standards that they would never demand from others.
We have to bear in mind that self-compassion is not something that we may be able to develop overnight, but there are various exercises we can practice to help us cultivate this:
2. Treat yourself as you would treat a friend. Imagine that your friend comes to you and tells you that they have committed the mistake that you have trouble forgiving yourself for. How woud you respond to your friend in this situation? Often, we allow more room for mistakes when it comes to others. For example, if a friend gets lazy and doesn’t answer your phone call, you probably wouldn’t immediately assume that they’re a bad person. Give yourself the same kind of permission to be human once in a while and remember that you’re not alone in being imperfect - we all have our own set of flaws. Here are some other guiding questions to help you with this exercise (1).
3. Be mindful of, and change the way that you speak to yourself.
Try to notice when you are being self-critical. Your self-critical voice may be so ingrained that you don’t even notice when it is present. What you can do is to try to think about what you say to yourself in the moments of self-guilt and self-pity that you mentioned. For example, if you missed one day of planned exercise because you were too tired, perhaps your inner voice may tell you something like “You’re so lazy”, and this could further compound the self-guilt. What we can do here is to try to replace these statements with more compassionate self-talk. If this is challenging, you could try to use the first exercise and put yourself in the shoes of a compassionate friend to get yourself started. In this case, the compassionate friend may say, “It’s okay to take some time off. Rest and recovery are also important contributions to your health.” While this exercise may feel effortful at the start, it will help you to develop self-compassion in that way that you speak to yourself if you try to practice it over time. Read more about this exercise here (2).
4. Lastly, I’d like to address the replaying of scenes in your mind of the mistake(s) made. While ruminating about a particular mistake may seem like an adaptive way of preventing future mistakes from occurring, overthinking can end up triggering memories of similar situations from the past, and a cumulation of these can instead quickly become overwhelming. It is important for us to make the distinction between ruminating and problem solving. To shift from rumination to problem solving, ask yourself, “What’s the best choice right now, given the reality of the situation?”. Start by taking the first step that you have thought out for yourself, then try to put some distance between yourself and these negative thoughts. You may choose to engage in some form of physical activity that you enjoy, or try out our mindfulness exercise (3) that may be helpful in learning how not to over-engage with sticky thoughts. Whenever you notice your mind starting to ruminate, try to catch yourself and engage in one of these activities. Although it might seem like an overly simple technique, distracting yourself in this manner regularly in the short term will go a long way in helping you move on from these ruminative thoughts.
I’ve linked some of these resources below. Hopefully some of these will be able to help you.

There could be many reasons why you are experiencing this. It could be a physiological or a psychological response to something. A life coach may also help to guide you along. To rule out anything physiological, you may consider visiting a GP (also trained in mental health) to gain that clarity.
You might want to try out the self assessment on mindline (https://mindline.sg/youth/assessment ) also. You may consider having a deeper conversation with a school counsellor or a mental health professional (eg. from Fei Yu, Singapore Association of Mental Health (SAMH) etc).

I have consolidated your questions to be answered (I hope you don’t mind!).
I understand it isn’t easy to cope and juggle studies, project deadlines, and CCA simultaneously. In addition, there is pressure to meet our parents, teachers, and our own expectations to perform well in school. These pressures, stresses, and emotions can weigh us down and cause us to feel exhausted and lose motivation in school or other areas of life. The loss of motivation and drive may also be why we hit the snooze button more often than we want to. Though all these emotions are normal and valid, we can take steps to cope better and move forward with greater optimism and clarity.
Here are some suggestions on what we can do:
- Develop New Routine (1) -
We can learn to use time management strategies to help us manage our time and take frequent breaks. On taking breaks, Dr. Gabija Toleikyte, a neuroscientist, recommends that the number of breaks required depends on the complexity of the task. Also, the frequency and duration of breaks need to be tailored to your case. She recommends a 10 minute break every hour and a half in the morning and increasing the frequency to a 10-minute break every hour after lunch. You can read more about her work on the neuroscience of motivation here (2)
Get enough sleep
Prioritise self-care and time with friends and family

Write a list of as many benefits of changing that habit as we can
Write down a list of negative consequences now and in the long term if we don’t change it
Seek clarity, visualise the future we want to build, and make small changes - The more vividly we can imagine the future we are trying to build, the more it stimulates our reward centres and the easier it is to resist the habits that get in the way.
You can take time to reflect and ask yourself these questions:
What would you like to do?
What would you like to look like and feel like?
How much money would you like to earn and have in your savings account?
What kind of relationship or family would you like to have?
What experiences would you like to have and who would you like to share them with?

Next, ask yourself these questions:
What one thing would I like to change this month?
Is that “one thing” achievable? Otherwise, what is the “good enough” standard
What could I do this week towards it?
What small step could I take this week to make this action possible?

I hear that this issue has been affecting you and may have also affected your motivation toward achieving your goals in life.
Though what you are experiencing is normal, we could also take steps to address ruminations that are holding us back from experiencing the joy and fulfillment in the present. A habit of rumination can affect our ability to think clearly and regulate our emotions. It may also make us feel isolated and alone, and we may even push others away.
Here are some simple ways we can do break free from rumination:
2. Engage in simple activities i.e., follow an origami tutorial on YouTube, do a word finder puzzle. You can learn more here (1).
3. Practice Self-Compassion Talks (2).
4. Be intention to connect with others
There is no issue too big or too small. If you feel that there is an issue you would like to share, I would encourage you to take the first step to make an appointment with your school therapist.
You may approach any mental health trained GPs or any nearby Youth Community Outreach Team (eg. Fei Yue Community Services, Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), Limitless, Shine Children and Youth Services etc). I do hope this will give you a quick initial idea on what to do next. Take care!

520,The “Right” Way,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/the-right-way/520,Is This Normal?,---,61,JasonQ,User,Professional (Moderator),900,2,"Hello @Cole , thank you for sharing your experiences and how you feel. This experience must have been challenging for you to manage, and I can imagine the fear of being judged by others.
First, what you are experiencing may result from underlying issues that may have happened in the past. These issues may cause you to feel anxious, and be extra careful to avoid going through the same unpleasant experience.
To address this issue, I encourage you to identify and write down the thoughts that cause you to feel anxious and behave cautiously. Then, as you examine these thoughts, see them from a third-person perspective. Seeing the thought from a third-person perspective helps create psychological distance between self and anxiety-inducing situations and enables you to regulate your emotions (1).
Take time and ask yourself these questions:
2. Is there another way to look at the situation?
3. What is within my control, and what resources can I adopt?
4. What is the worst thing that could happen if my fears come true?
Here is a good article to learn more about how you can manage the anxiety and stresses you are experiencing (2). You can also learn more about how you can cope with your emotions in these articles:
- Healthline: How to control your emotions (3)
- Healthhub: Care For Ourselves - Managing our Emotions (4)
Lastly, talk to a trusted adult or your school counsellor. Processing with your counsellor can give you different perspectives and ways to cope with the issues better.

To feel left out by your community is not a good feeling or experience. It can often make us question who we are as a person and affects our confidence in life. I am glad that you are seeking help from the Counsellors and would encourage you to continue to do so.
I want to share with you that all emotions are valid, and there are no good or bad emotions. However, our feelings can communicate to us that there are underlying unmet needs that require our attention. In this instance, the unmet need may be forming a secure attachment with people. However, this unmet need also results in us feeling fearful or losing confidence when we need to speak in front of people.
Here are what we can do:
2. Write down one committed goal and action. What are you committed to doing over the next 1-2 weeks to see improvement or changes? Having the end goal in mind helps us become more intentional about our actions. We can do this by setting SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, and Realistic).
- An example of a SMART Goal could be: “I want to be able to ask my friend Tom and Jerry out for a meal and have a meal with them next week.”
- If your goal is, “I want to be happier,” perhaps consider what some of the things you would do when you are happier are (i.e., spend time with family or friends). Here is a resource on how you can set goals (1)
- With this goal in mind, identify the barrier preventing you from having a meal with Tom and Jerry. Are there any expectations, self-doubt, or criticism you are holding on to? Spend some time writing these thoughts down on a piece of paper
3. Next, try this metaphor.
- Place the paper with your thoughts in front of you and try to push the paper away to get rid of it. You will find that over time, you will feel tired and give up trying. Eventually, we give up trying, and this “paper” becomes closer and closer to us, and we become consumed by the thoughts written on the paper. You can watch this video for the demonstration and explanation: [What does Acceptance mean? - Experiential exercise Metaphor (Push the paper) - YouTube ].
4. In many situations of our life, we often get stuck with unhelpful thoughts that would result in an automatic response or action. We can become fused with these thoughts and believe that these thoughts are real when they could be our assumptions or false belief. Therefore, the first step to regulating emotions is learning to recognize these thoughts. We can challenge these unhelpful thoughts by looking for pieces of evidence that do not support our beliefs. We can also change the narrative from “I am unloved, or no one loves or cares about me” to “I am having thoughts that I am unlovable.” See how this helps you to take a step back and see yourself from a third-person perspective? Changing our narrative also helps to reduce the intensity of our thoughts. Here are other ways you can use to change the narrative (2).
5. Allow the emotions to pass. Just as these emotions can come, they can also leave us. You can place these emotions on the passing clouds and see them drift away (3). Then focus on the committed actions that you have set out to do.

Identifying whether we are feeling stress or burnout is essential.
If you are experiencing stress in life, I will encourage you to take frequent breaks while working on challenging tasks. One good task management technique is the Pomodoro Technique. You can read more about the technique here (1). The Pomodoro Technique helps because it forces us to focus on one task at a time. We often like to engage in multiple tasks when we are studying or working. We could be switching numerous tasks within a short period. However, studies have shown that we become less efficient and more prone to making mistakes when we do multiple tasks simultaneously (2). Therefore the strategy is to focus on one task at a time.
However, if you are experiencing burnout, I will encourage you to engage in these four activities:
2. Connect with other people
3. Evaluate your priorities and Set Boundaries
4. Make time for exercise
5. Eat healthy
These four activities can help us cope with symptoms and regain our energy, focus, and sense of well-being. You can read more about how you can manage the burnout in this article (3).
Lastly, talk to a trusted adult or your school counsellor. Processing with your counsellor can provide you with different perspectives and ways you can cope with the issues better.

I hear you are trying to build friendships with your peers but feel unseen or cared for by them. I can see that this issue seems to be a constant struggle for you, and you need to put in lots of effort to keep this friendship going. I can understand the situation you are in.
I want to share with you that in life, we have no control over how others feel, respond, or behave towards us. But often, we worry a lot about how others react when we make certain decisions. This worry limits our freedom to express ourselves and takes away our joy.
However, we have control over our thoughts, emotions, and the choices we choose to make. We can start by writing down one goal and action we are committed to do. Remember that these small changes we make will have a significant long-term outcome (1).
Here are what we can do:
2. What are you committed to doing over the next 1-2 weeks to see improvement or changes? Having the end goal in mind helps us become more intentional about our actions. We can do this by setting SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, and Realistic).
- An example of a SMART Goal could be: “I want to be able to ask my friend Tom and Jerry out for a meal and have a meal with them next week.”
- If your goal is, “I want to be happier,” perhaps consider what some of the things you would do when you are happier are (i.e., spend time with family or friends). Here is a resource on how you can set goals (2)
- With this goal in mind, identify the barrier preventing you from having a meal with Tom and Jerry. Are there any expectations, self-doubt, or criticism you are holding on to? Spend some time writing these thoughts down on a piece of paper
3. We can learn to allow our emotions to pass. Just as these emotions can come, they can also leave us. You can place these emotions on the passing clouds and see them drift away (3). Then focus on the committed actions that you have set out to do.
4. Talk to a trusted adult or counsellor. I would encourage you to take time and share the issue with a trusted adult so that they can journey alongside you. It might be challenging to start, but it will be a valuable process. You can read this link on how you can prepare for a session (4).

First, I want to affirm your courage to share your concerns. The fear you feel is normal, and many of my clients experience this fear when they first embark on their counseling sessions.
To overcome your fear and concern, I suggest you could:
- Identify what is causing you to have fear. Name the thoughts holding you back or causing you to avoid approaching the situation. Are you worried if you cannot “click” with the therapist, or are you fearful about sharing the problems with the therapist? These are questions that we can address before we approach the session.
- As this is your first session, pace yourself on what you want to share. You can start by addressing what the problem is and how this problem is affecting your life (i.e., school, family, or friends). You can also share how long you have been facing the problem and how you have attempted to overcome it. You may also share how you have been coping with the problem.
The first step in seeking help is always the hardest but take one action at a time. I want to encourage you to focus on the goals and outcomes that you would like to see happening as well.

312,What do I do in between therapy sessions?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/what-do-i-do-in-between-therapy-sessions/312,Treatment & Recovery,"mentalhealth, therapy, healing",64,mrpeanutbutter,User,,449,1,"I realise this sounds ridiculous, but my issue is essentially that my problems stop me from doing too many things and so I essentially end up unable to do anything except wait for the next therapy session.
Sometimes i get really frustrated that I’m not making any/ as much progress as I would like to, especially after a therapy session. And a lot of the times, I feel more sad after attending a therapy session. I think this is due to all the bad memories that arise when I try to unpack my feelings and emotions during a therapy session.
I just feel physically unable, or too tired to, implement the coping strategies that I learnt during therapy IRL. I’m also finding it very difficult to socialise more, as I have essentially lost interest in pretty much everything and I don’t really feel comfortable meeting new people.
I know that I’m not supposed to be reliant on therapy, but it has become such a safe/ comfortable space for me, and I’m just constantly disappointed by my lack of progress outside therapy sessions. What should I do?",,0,,,,,
312,What do I do in between therapy sessions?,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/what-do-i-do-in-between-therapy-sessions/312,Treatment & Recovery,"mentalhealth, therapy, healing",42,tehbing,User,Professional (Moderator),453,2,"Hello there. First off, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with feeling this way. Therapy isn’t a cakewalk. In fact, a lot of people attending therapy sessions tend to feel worse before feeling better.
My first tip is to be gentle with yourself, and let your therapist know what you’re feeling, so that you can both work together to develop coping strategies based on your specific needs and interests.
Immediately after your therapy session, try to take some time to think about what you discussed. Consider any revelations you may have had and try to be aware of these things going forward. By paying closer attention to your thoughts and actions, you will have an opportunity to make constructive changes based on your discussions in therapy.
It also sounds like you’re finding it challenging to implement the coping strategies as they seem too big/ scary/ intensive. Try taking it step by step. And learn to credit yourself for every step of the way- no matter how small that step is. Eg: When you’re feeling overwhelmed, start with short, breathing exercises. Try to implement these breathing exercises every time you feel stressed/ anxious. After practicing this for a while, you’ll realize that taking deep breaths becomes intuitive. Then, you can slowly implement new habits such as writing down your thoughts in a journal/ taking daily slow walks outdoors etc.
Progress is never linear, and you don’t have to beat yourself up over not seeing the progress that you expected. In fact, signing up for therapy + going for regular therapy sessions are already great steps in taking charge of your mental health, and I’m proud of you for doing that! We are all rooting for you in this recovery journey.",,4,,,,,
