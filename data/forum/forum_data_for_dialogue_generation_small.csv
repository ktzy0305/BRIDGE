Thank you for your courage to reach out for help. I am sorry to hear about what you are experiencing. My understanding is that you feel unheard, misunderstood and alone. You have shared that there is no emotional validation or support. There is also a lot of stress you are facing due to an upcoming exam.
Firstly, your feelings are fully understandable and fairly common given the challenging circumstances you are in. I encourage you to reach out to a trusted schoolteacher to get the necessary help needed to better prepare for your exams. Build a routine around your studies and fortify your study skills, one step at a time.
If you are comfortable to, please do consider engaging your school counsellor. The counsellor would be able to provide a non-judgmental and safe space for you to process your emotions and make better sense of them. Furthermore, the counsellor and you can work together and equip you with strategies to better regulate your emotions and choose proactive actions you can take to overcome challenges.
She could also facilitate you in identifying who you are, what you stand for and what you hope to achieve. The clarity you develop is likely to help you map out the actions you need to take to achieve your aspirations and needs. The counsellor can help you develop essential skills and brainstorm strategies to build trusting, balanced and fulfilling relationships.
Please do keep taking small positive steps forward and build towards what you aspire to achieve. Stay focused and optimistic. You can do this.",,0,,,,,

Thanks for confiding here. Sorry to hear about what you’re facing right now, it must feel like a confusing time and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.
From what I can infer from your post, it seems like you feel a sense of loneliness and isolation from others, due to the dismissiveness of the people around you with regards to your emotions, and extending from that, resulting in you feeling like you’re unable to trust them? Yet at the same time, it seems that you are hoping to be able to satisfy these feelings of loneliness and isolation.
It is understandable that these feelings may cause a sense of confusion within you. We as people are not 1-dimensional and can experience a myriad of different feelings at times, some which may contract each other, with many a times, them stemming from the same problem as well!
Understand that you feel like you can’t confide in anyone. Do you think you can identify a certain person or people that you may feel more confident in confiding too? How often do you feel these emotions?",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’ve been going through. It’s clear that you care deeply about your work, and that’s something to be proud of. Working in healthcare comes with immense responsibility, and the fact that you’re feeling so affected by these recent mistakes shows just how seriously you take that responsibility.
First, I want to acknowledge that making mistakes, while difficult, is part of being human—especially in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It’s natural to feel disappointed in yourself, but it’s important to remember that everyone, no matter how experienced or careful, makes mistakes at times. What matters most is how we learn from those experiences and use them to grow.
It sounds like these mistakes have really shaken your confidence, and that’s understandable. When we’re afraid of being labeled as “incompetent,” it can feel overwhelming, and that fear can make it hard to focus on anything else. But I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself during this time. You’re already being very careful in your work, and that’s a good sign that you’re committed to doing your best.
Improving yourself doesn’t mean being perfect—it means being open to learning and growing. One way to start rebuilding your confidence is to reflect on what you’ve learned from these experiences. What steps can you take to minimize the chances of making similar mistakes in the future? Are there areas where you can seek additional training or support from your colleagues? Sometimes, reaching out to a mentor or a trusted colleague for advice can provide you with new perspectives and practical tips.
It’s also important to address the fear and anxiety you’re feeling. These emotions are valid, but they don’t have to define your career. It might help to talk to someone about how you’re feeling, whether it’s a counselor, a supervisor, or a colleague you trust. Sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load and may also lead to support and encouragement that you didn’t expect.
Keep in mind that these errors do not entirely define your value as a healthcare professional. You’ve made it this far in your career because you have skills, knowledge, and a commitment to helping others. Don’t lose sight of that. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and they don’t take away from all the good you’ve done and will continue to do.
Take it one step at a time, and try to focus on what you can control—your effort, your attitude, and your willingness to learn. You’re stronger than you think, and this experience, while challenging, can ultimately make you a more resilient and compassionate healthcare worker.
Please take care of yourself, and know that it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. You don’t have to go through this alone, and there are people who can support you as you rebuild your confidence and continue to grow in your career.",,1,,,,,

i see that you are putting in a lot of effort to be careful, that is great! i’m sure that the people around you will take note of that, it shows that you are doing your best and have a positive work ethic. however, mistakes do still happen, and that’s very normal and common. i know that is difficult to take in… but what i’ve found helps is to remind myself that mistakes are normal, beginner or not, and it’s actually how we learn! without mistakes, i feel that the learning process will be much slower and unfulfilling it also helped me a lot to talk to my superiors and colleagues and hearing that they make their fair share of mistakes too! at times, they even openly and willingly share that they have messed up in something mistakes are part and parcel of life, including at work. it does not make you incompetent, it only makes you human, what’s important is how you make use of the experience to grow.
be kind to yourself, don’t stress yourself out by thinking that you need to do more and more, the fact that you are trying your best now is enough. mistakes don’t make you a poor worker. keep going at it, and i wish you all the best!!",,1,,,,,

Hi there,
Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—your struggles are completely valid. I want you to know that you’re not alone; I’ve also made multiple mistakes at work before, and I understand how hard it can be to deal with the fear and self-doubt that follows.
It’s clear that you have good intentions and are working hard to do your best, and that’s already something to commend yourself for. You care deeply about your work, and that’s really important.
While these mistakes might shake your confidence, they shouldn’t shake your view of yourself. Remember, you make mistakes, but you are not a mistake. This is a tough line of work, and despite the challenges, you can continue to make a positive impact on others, just as I’m sure you’ve done already. Keep it up!
What helped me in similar situations was owning up to my mistakes voluntarily. I found it helpful to have an open conversation with my superiors about what I could have done better and to reassure them that I’m committed to putting in the effort to improve. This not only showed them that I was serious about learning from my mistakes but also helped me regain some confidence in myself.
You’ve got this, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time.
Best,

I feel that you are someone who is really responsible and strives to do their best at work through you reflecting on wanting to improve yourself. My first ever work experience in healthcare was during my poly internship and I experienced a lot of distress too. The industry is so fast paced, with patients rushing in and out, coupled with so many things to learn. I can understand how you feel when it comes to feeling disappointed, and being seen as incompetent, as I have went through that as well.
What I found useful for me was that I did a weekly review on what were the areas I could improve on, as well as what I have done well! It is perfectly human nature to make mistakes, and we often only see the negative side because of that. While it is great that we take measures to improve ourselves, please do not forget to also acknowledge your own strengths!
Thank you for your sharing and remember that you are not alone in your journey as a healthcare worker. Wish you all the best and take care!",,1,,,,,

Perhaps noting down these mistakes would be useful to help you remember and not repeat the mistakes.

I’m truly sorry to hear about the struggles you’ve been facing and the experience you had in counselling. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, especially when expressing your feelings is difficult, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must have been to feel dismissed during such a vulnerable time.
First, I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel the way you do. What you’re going through is incredibly tough, and it’s not something you should have to navigate alone. It’s understandable that you felt frustrated when the counsellor expected you to have answers that are so hard to find when you’re in a place of pain.
Expressing your feelings doesn’t always come naturally—especially when those feelings are tangled up in layers of pain, confusion, or fear. It takes time, patience, and guidance from experienced and professional counsellors who understand that these things can’t be rushed.
Counselling should be a space where you feel supported, even when the words don’t come easily. The goal is to work together, at your pace, to make sense of those thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, it seems like the approach you experienced wasn’t the right fit, but that doesn’t mean that you’re beyond help or that no one cares. It simply means that the approach wasn’t tailored to your needs, which can happen sometimes. It doesn’t reflect your value or your worthiness of support.
Reaching out for help again might feel daunting, especially after what you’ve been through, but there are professionals who can and will meet you where you are—without expecting you to have it all figured out. Sometimes, it’s about finding the right person who understands how to support you in the way that works for you.
Please know that you deserve help, and there are people who truly care and want to support you, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now. If you’re open to it, can you share where you have gone for help? So that we can guide you toward resources or strategies that might be a better fit. It’s also important to keep in mind that mental health crises are serious, and reaching out to someone immediately—whether it’s a crisis line, a trusted friend, or a different professional—can make a difference.
You’ve taken a brave step in sharing your feelings here, and that’s not something to overlook. It shows that part of you still wants to find a way forward, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. I’m here to listen, and so are others who genuinely want to help.
Please take care, and don’t give up on finding the support you deserve.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for trusting me enough to share more about what you’re going through. I’m really sorry to hear about your experiences with your school counselor and psychiatrist. It must have been incredibly painful to feel dropped like that, especially when you were already feeling low. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel hurt and disappointed by how things turned out.
First, I would like you to know that having a negative experience is not a reflection of your worth. You are not a burden, and you are absolutely not wasting anyone’s time. Mental health professionals are there to support you, and it’s unfortunate that your experiences made you feel otherwise. The fact that they might have a lot of cases to handle doesn’t diminish the importance of your struggles or your right to receive help. It’s not about you being “less important”—it’s about finding the right support that meets your needs.
I know it’s hard not to hate yourself when it feels like you’re stuck in this painful place, but I want to remind you that reaching out for help—like you did with your counselors, and even here—takes a lot of strength. You deserve to be heard, supported, and cared for, just like anyone else. You are not a joke, and your life has value, even if it’s hard to see that right now.
It might help to try connecting with a different professional who can better understand and support you, or even reaching out to a support group where you can share your experiences with others who might be going through something similar. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to find the right fit, and that’s okay. You’re not alone in this, and there are people out there who genuinely want to help.
Please remember that these feelings, as overwhelming as they are, don’t define you. There is hope, even if it’s hard to feel it at the moment, and there are people who care and want to see you through this. If things ever feel too overwhelming, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust—they’re there to help you in these moments.
You’ve already taken some brave steps by reaching out here, and that’s not something to overlook. Is there a teacher that you trust that you can speak to at school? How about asking your friends, do they know of another counsellor? Perhaps they can help you escalate your case again? Let us know when you get a chance to try again…",,0,,,,,

Firstly, I am so proud of you for being brave and step out to seek help. I know it is really tough to muster your courage especially when you are already in a terrible space and might be close to giving up so I am really proud of you for that.
As I said earlier that I was in a similar situation like you, I had no thoughts, too tired to talk, too tired to think, just tired and numb to pain. In the end, I switched and tried multiple counsellors then things slowly get better. I think counsellors are like teachers in some sense, some students think that this teacher is good at teaching because he/she explains the whole context and background but some students think he/she is bad at teaching because they think this teacher is naggy and they like key points that are straight to the point. The main point of me saying this is - we also need to find counsellors who fit our condition and our needs so try looking for another counsellor again. If you don’t have the courage or capacity to seek for a counsellor again, feel free to reach out to us here. I’m here for you and many others are here for you as well.
I am fortunate that things are looking better for me now and a message to my current self would be - things have been rough and tough but I’m glad you are in the present. I hope you are able to say the same thing 2/5/10/more years down the road to yourself with pride of what you have overcome and achieve.

Thank you for sharing your experiences, feelings and struggles with much courage and openness. Your concerns are fully valid and 100% understandable.
May I share with you that overthinking is a daily common cognitive or thinking distortion among many of us, especially when we are faced with life stressors? Many of us recognise this tendency and have overcome it so please do not be too disheartened.
I encourage you to consider these approaches as you journey to reduce overthinking:
2. Mindfulness: Practice being present in the moment, focusing on your breath, and letting go of worries about the past or future.
3. Self-reflection: Identify triggers and patterns of overthinking, and challenge negative thoughts. Not all thoughts are true, so challenging them is a good way to check for accuracy.
4. Communication: Openly discuss your concerns with your girlfriend, and work together to establish boundaries and reassurance. Let her know how it is affecting you so that both of you can have a honest conversation.
5. Trust-building: Focus on nurturing your relationship, fostering trust, and developing emotional security. Strengthen your relationship with your girlfriend through mutual respect and openness. Speak calmly and use I statements instead of inadvertently using blame language or accusatory tones.Clear any misunderstandings in the bud.
6. Anxious attachment support: Consider couples therapy or individual counselling to address attachment issues.
Remember, overcoming overthinking and anxious attachment takes time, patience, and effort. Be gentle with yourself, and prioritise open communication with your girlfriend. Relationships need constant tender loving care, plenty of give and take and honesty to thrive.",,0,,,,,

When my friends want to meet up i will normally drag myself go but I will pray it to end soon so I can go home asap or i will go mia on my friends purposely ignore their message or call.
When people tell me about their life story i dunno how to react normally i just listen and nod or laugh it off. I feel detached from life when I’m looking at myself and everything around me from a 3rd party view.
When things get too much or too troublesome I will disconnect myself from everything, I stop answering call or text from friends or family or stop turning up for meet up find reason to reject them or just ignore them.
This has been going on for years on and off. I felt that I need help at some point so I tried to get help by going to polyclinic get referral to a psychiatrist, he asked me to see a therapist after 1 or 2 session I couldn’t connect with them I stop going.
I feel suffocated I think I should seek help but at same time I felt that I am beyond help and it’s also financially taxing so I stop thinking of getting help. I’m just exhausted from everything",,0,,,,,

I want to thank you for sharing your experience here—it takes courage to open up about what you’re going through, especially when it feels like you’ve been carrying this weight alone for so long.
From what you’ve described, it sounds like you’re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and exhaustion, both mentally and physically. The way you’re feeling—detached, unmotivated, irritated, and low on energy—are all common signs of burnout or depression. It’s clear that this has been a long, difficult journey for you, and I can understand why you’d feel exhausted and unsure of where to turn next.
One of the hardest things about what you’re going through is that it often feels like a vicious cycle. The less energy you have, the harder it becomes to take care of yourself, and the more things like work, social interactions, and even basic tasks start to feel impossible. It’s not surprising that this has been going on for years—when depression or burnout takes hold, it can be incredibly difficult to break out of it without the right support.
It sounds like your job, while stressful, is also something that’s keeping you grounded, and that’s important to recognize. However, the strain it’s putting on you, particularly with the expectations and communication issues at work, is clearly taking a toll. The frustration you’re feeling with your colleagues and the avoidance of social interactions might be your mind and body’s way of trying to protect you from further stress, even if it doesn’t always feel like the healthiest response.
You mentioned that you’ve tried seeking help before but found it difficult to connect with the therapist, and I’m really sorry that it wasn’t a better experience for you. Finding the right therapist can sometimes take time, and it’s understandable to feel discouraged when it doesn’t work out right away—especially when it’s financially taxing as well. But I want to encourage you to consider that help is still out there, and you’re not beyond it. It’s not that you’re “beyond help,” but rather that you haven’t found the right kind of support yet.
If financial concerns are making it difficult to seek help, there are free or low-cost options available that might be worth exploring. Here are other community options you can consider:
2. Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) - 1800-283 7019
3. IMH CHAT: webCHAT
4. SOS - 1767
5. Care Corner Counselling Centre - 1800-353 5800
6. The Safe Space Foundation (Non-profit): Get pro bono counselling by booking the voucher codes on the Safe Space ISO 27001 platform]
These resources are here to help you, and they can be a lifeline when you’re feeling overwhelmed.
It might also help to start with small, manageable steps—things that don’t feel too overwhelming but can make a difference over time. Whether that’s creating a small daily routine, finding a moment each day to focus on something that brings you even a little bit of comfort, or reaching out to someone who might understand what you’re going through. If the idea of therapy feels too much right now, maybe a support group or even an online community could be a softer way to reconnect with others who might be facing similar struggles.
I also want to emphasize that feeling suffocated and disconnected doesn’t mean you’re beyond repair—it means you’re carrying a lot, and it’s understandable that you’d feel worn down. It’s okay to need help, and it’s okay to take your time in finding it. Even if it feels like it, you’re not alone in this, and there are people who want to see you through it.
If it ever feels too overwhelming, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a crisis line or someone you trust. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to in those moments can make a big difference.
You’ve already taken a big step by sharing here, and that’s something to hold onto. Take care, and remember that it’s okay to ask for help—you deserve support just as much as anyone else.",SAMH https://www.samhealth.org.sg/our-services/outreach/samh-insight-centre/#1545895446184-0c71e7f9-ecc9; webCHAT 1 https://www.imh.com.sg/CHAT/GetHelp/webCHAT/Pages/default.aspx; Care Corner https://www.carecorner.org.sg/services/insight,0,,,,,

I can relate to how you’re feeling such as feeling tired (mentally & physically). There are days when I feel like that too and what brings me back together is after I have recharged myself by doing things that I like or having my own time. After a long day of work or school, it’s normal for us to feel tired both physically and mentally as we are out to interact with people the entire day so don’t feel bad about doing nothing . Sometimes it is normal for us to feel tired from meeting others as we all need our own time to recharge our social batteries.
If you’re an introvert, I would recommend starting with something or finding a hobby that is indoor or something you can do yourself before stepping out or doing activities with others.

It’s really brave of you to share, especially when things feel this overwhelming. I can tell you’re feeling drained and disconnected, and that must be so tough to deal with.
It sounds like you’ve been going through a rough patch for a while now, and it’s totally understandable that you’re feeling burnt out and unmotivated. The pressure from work, relationships, and how you feel about yourself is definitely making everything feel heavier. Sometimes, pulling back from everything is just your body and mind trying to cope with all the exhaustion.
The stress of trying to meet work expectations, especially in a customer service role, must be huge. It makes sense that you feel stuck—wanting to quit but also needing that stability work gives you.
It’s awesome that you tried to get help before, even though it didn’t go as planned. Finding the right support can take time, and finding the right therapist is super important as feeling comfortable and understood by your counselor can make a big difference in how helpful therapy is. Sometimes it takes trying a few different therapists before you click with one, but when you do, it can really help.
There are affordable options in the community that might make it easier to try again. You can find a suitable service based on your needs using thisService wayfinding.
You’re definitely not beyond help. Even small steps, like cleaning a bit of your space or getting outside for a few minutes, can make a difference. You don’t need to fix everything at once.

It’s normal to feel tired and want to zone out, cave in your room and space and not want or need to respond to anyone or anything. At the same time, I think you recognise and know this is also a problem in the sense that you’re not connecting with the outer world and perhaps yourself too - that you’ve numbed yourself from so many things.
But if you don’t mind, give yourself 1 minute to breathe and meditate. Doesn’t have to be thinking of anything, it can just be an empty thought - but just for you to clear your mind. This can be extended to 10 minutes. From there, you can slowly inch your way to give a bit more time for yourself, like 1 full day, to be you - without any shame or guilt.
Sometimes we worry about being judged and seen in a low, negative light. And it makes us wonder, is it even worth doing anything for ourselves? We end up digging deeper into ourselves where it feels safe to not be judged. But I hope that by giving yourself that bit of time carved to meditate, to be you to just take a walk and look at the beautiful sunset and its orange hues cut across the blue sky - it’ll let you feel a lil’ bit more. To feel you can be you, and you don’t need to over-worry what others might think of you and that you can slowly rebuild your own self confidence.
If you ever worry you don’t matter - I hope you can come back and read the thoughtful messages put here for you, or also across this platform and elsewhere. There are people who care for you and I hope you can see that and feel that.

Recently i got retrenched from my ex-company and it took me 2 months to finally found a job. My current company is my third company. People here and work here are quite manageable but I always have the thoughts and feelings of emotions that I am not good enough. I am currently seeing a therapist but it felt like it is never enough. I feel supported and having someone being there to support me when i meet her, but afterwards I feel all alone again. I know I can always look for friends or my partner to talk about things, but it felt like friends are also busy with their lives too and it doesn’t lift the loneliness I have being feeling. And when my friends were too busy to hear me, I feel neglected and want to just shut down. I keep going in circles and repeating my problems as well.
I think my childhood trauma has played a part to my insecure feelings. 2th month into this job, I feel the urge to give up and quit again. I cannot seem to be able to find meaning and purpose in my job as I have no passion here. Back in my days, I will usually stick to just one friend to feel happy and that is enough for me to carry on with my day. But after entering the workforce, I can’t seem to find the that one friend that keeps me moving.
My therapist mentioned that it was due to me not feeling secure about myself. It felt like I cannot fit in, my skills and knowledge are not there as well and it makes me very demoralising and just want to give up. I talked to therapist, talk to my partner and friends but it just feel like my voice, my unhappiness is still there. Some people say money could be a source of motivation, which is sustainable and stable, compared to friends in a workforce which can changed anytime. However, I still cant feel any motivation as I don’t see money as important. My parents were so busy working for money that I feel is the main reason for the broken family of ours.

Thank you for reaching out and the courage displayed by sharing your struggles and insecurities. Please take heart that you are human, as are all of us, and having insecurities, seeking social connection and a sense of purpose are fully normal, valid and understandable.
May I also say that feelings of loneliness, insecurity, and the urge to quit your job are common experiences for individuals dealing with mental health challenges, particularly those with a history of anxiety and schizophrenia-like symptoms.
(a)Here are some insights which may help you understand what you are going through:
Job Insecurity and Mental Health
I have observed that job insecurity can magnify feelings of anxiety and depression. When we feel insecure in our jobs, we are more likely to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which can lead to difficulties in concentration and motivation at work. This insecurity may also contribute to a cycle of feeling inadequate and wanting to quit when faced with discomfort.
Impact of Childhood Trauma
Childhood trauma can significantly affect self-esteem and feelings of worthiness. This background may contribute to your current feelings of not being “good enough” and can manifest in your professional life, leading to a lack of passion and purpose in your job.
Support Systems
I am glad that you have engaged a therapist and feel supported. Understandably, feelings of loneliness can persist outside these sessions. It’s important to recognize that friends and family may also be preoccupied with their own lives, which can leave you feeling isolated. Building a reliable support network is crucial, but it may take time to find those connections that feel fulfilling. Start small, such as joining a hobby group.
(b)May I encourage you to consider these strategies to enhance motivation and achieve greater satisfaction:
Therapy
Continue working with your therapist on strategies to build self-esteem and address feelings of inadequacy. Therapy can be effective in reshaping negative thought patterns and developing coping mechanisms for anxiety and job-related stress.
Finding Meaning in Work
Since you mentioned a lack of passion in your current role, consider exploring aspects of your job that you might enjoy or find meaningful.
Setting small, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and purpose, even in a job that doesn’t ignite your passion.
Work-Life Balance
Seek ways to balance work demands with personal interests and self-care.
Engaging in hobbies or activities outside of work can provide a sense of fulfillment and help mitigate feelings of loneliness.
Consider Job Flexibility
If possible, discuss flexible working arrangements with your employer. This could help you manage your mental health better while maintaining your job responsibilities.
Evaluate Job Fit
If feelings of wanting to quit persist, it may be worth evaluating whether this job aligns with your long-term goals and values. Sometimes, a change in environment can lead to improved mental health and job satisfaction.
Making the decision to quit a job should be based on a thorough evaluation of your mental health needs and career goals. If the work environment is consistently detrimental to your well-being and you feel no potential for growth or fulfillment, it might be worth considering a change.
However, do have a plan in place for what comes next, whether that’s another job, further education, or a break to focus on your mental health.
Your feelings are valid, and it’s important to continue seeking support while exploring ways to enhance your job satisfaction and personal fulfillment.
Remember, stability and fulfillment come from within. Focus on personal growth, self-care, and building a support network.",,2,,,,,

I would like to just summarise what i have been feeling lately even so i have not been diagnosed with depression i always felt that i am and some signs are similar.
I never had a great childhood, it was painful. I was brought up in a harsh way. My whole life i never felt i was good enough probably no one has ever told me i was, instead i have always been the problem. The trauma has never vanished it comes back whenever i am emotionally and mentally unstable i would say. I am not crazy, i just get very stress to a point whereby i can feel my head hurts due to thinking too much, i get slightly breathless & nauseous. I am unable to focus at work, very forgetful and i feel like i just want to be home i used to succeed in everything i do, i get compliments at work however lately the stress came back, they feel like i am underperforming which then demotivates me even more.
I have a good job, but many personal issues are bringing me down to my lowest. I feel lonely, abandoned at times when i am stress i feel like i am less of a mother even though i pushed myself to care for both of my kids. My kids have seen me cry but at the end of the day they are my pillar of strength. I love them very much but at times i feel that my approach to them hurts them when they do something wrong i am this way is because i am stress to a point whereby i feel that my head hurts so much and also i do not want them to be the younger me i do not want them to go through what i’ve been through.
I have a partner, that has expectations of how i should treat him however when i try to talk things out and tell him how i feel too he do not want to consider. When we argue he leaves me and “run away” from problems. He abandoned my feelings & mental health he always said this is just a sense of control he do not wish to understand.
At times i feel suicidal(the thoughts of my children is what kept me going even though i may be in an bad emotional and mental control). When i felt empty and very stress as i always have felt nobody consideres how i feel, i feel like i am unheard and my feelings don’t matter. Back then there were few times i banged my head on the wall because i was in so much emotional pain being pushed emotionally and mentally by my partner, i put myself in pain to “remove” the current pain it kind of helped i then just stay silent i felt the whole world shut down. I can’t control my emotions most of the time i cry alot my chest hurts.
I wake up everyday trying to be normal i drag myself up to be at work, to go on with daily life. Put a fake smile to my face but only i know there are so much in my heart which was never solved nor said. Everytime when i share my feelings with people i love or trust i am the problem, i am the one unable to “control” my thoughts. Help me is this a sign of depression? How can i know or be diagnosed?",,1,,,,,

Thank you for your immense courage in sharing what you are experiencing. I am sad to hear about your struggles and want to let you know that your feelings of hurt and sadness are fully understandable and deeply valid. You are carrying a heavy burden. However, I also observe that despite all the challenges stacked against you, your resilience and strengths are shining through and I commend you for that .
While I can’t provide a diagnosis, I can help explore your emotions and suggest some steps you might consider taking for your well-being.
Understanding your feelings
From what you’ve described, it seems you are experiencing several signs that could be associated with emotional distress, depression or anxiety, such as:
Persistent Sadness: Feeling lonely, abandoned, or unheard.
Physical Symptoms: Headaches, breathlessness, and nausea when stressed.
Difficulty Concentrating: Struggling to focus at work and feeling forgetful.
Emotional Pain: Crying frequently and feeling overwhelmed by emotions.
Suicidal Thoughts: Experiencing thoughts of self-harm, self harming and feeling hopeless.
Impact of Past Trauma
Your childhood experiences and the trauma you mentioned can significantly affect your emotional health. The feelings of inadequacy and stress you described may stem from unresolved issues from your past. It’s important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can influence your current relationships and parenting.
Steps to Consider
2. Seek Professional Help
A mental health professional can provide a safe space to explore your feelings. They can help you understand your emotions and develop coping strategies.
3. Communicate with Your Partner
Communicate your feelings to your partner when you are both calm. Use “I” statements to express how you feel without placing blame (e.g., “I feel overwhelmed when…”).
If your partner’s behavior is affecting your mental health, it’s key to establish boundaries that protect your well-being.
4. Practice Self-Care
Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.
Regular exercise can boost your mood and energy levels. It doesn’t have to be intense; even a daily walk can be beneficial.
Journaling your thoughts and feelings can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you process your experiences.
5. Connect with Supportive People
Talk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can help you feel less isolated.
If certain relationships contribute to your stress, consider setting limits on your interactions with those individuals.
6. Recognise the Need for Professional Diagnosis
If you find that your feelings persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to seek a formal evaluation from a mental health professional. They can conduct assessments to determine whether you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition.
7. Signs to Seek Immediate Help
If you ever feel that you might act on suicidal thoughts or feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, please reach out for immediate help. Contact the 24 hour hotline run by SOS at 1767 or go to your nearest hospital A&E.
Your feelings are important, and your life is extremely precious, Fiara. It’s crucial to prioritise your mental health for both yourself and your children. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve unconditional support and understanding as you navigate these challenges. Take one step at a time, and know that you are not alone in this journey. Please never give up, just keep on going.",,0,,,,,

We have been acting like couples do but we have yet to put on a label to our relationship. I feel that what’s stopping me is that I am still unsure/have doubts about proceeding with him. First of all, my closest friends who have yet to meet him doesn’t really like him and they think that I deserve better. Their opinions matter a lot to me because they are my friends for half of my life. Secondly, I believe that right now we are in the honeymoon period whereby everything is smooth and we are very comfortable with each other. I am just worried and unsure if this will continue on and whether we are truly compatible. We don’t have much interests in common as well. To give you more context, I met him in exchange 2 months back where we spent almost everyday together. My friends told me that it could be the feeling of attachment and that is not genuine attraction. Hence, so far I am not 100% certain of my feelings for him if it is genuine love. For him, I am quite certain that he is attracted to me physically but I am unsure if he is attracted to me emotionally. I feel that emotional attraction is very important to sustain the relationship because I will grow old eventually and I will turn old and wrinkly you know. Although I said that I am uncertain about my feelings, I am showing him a lot of affection and I absolutely adore him like taking good care of him and pampering him. I am just doubting myself right now because I show him a lot of love yet I am unsure of my feelings so am I lovebombing him. Also, he mentioned to be that he is not great or dont know how to show his affection or love to people so sometimes it makes me insecure like he says that he is certain about me and truly loves me but yet I can love and show him love in a lot of ways that he can receive (for someone like myself who isnt sure yet). I am confused. Maybe I shouldn’t compare love in this way, I dont know. He also didnt mention to me what are his vision or plans for our future together. I did mention to him about how I feel and I hope he can communicate to me about his thoughts which he agreed but so far didnt. He said that he did think about those topics but he is just shy and don’t open up easily to engage in this kind of topics. At the same time, I feel like I am carrying this relationship like deciding where to eat, steering the relationship, which sometimes I feel tired but I shrug it aside because I love (can be as friends or more, still unsure) and care for him. I understand all of these, but right now when we are still in a situationship/exploration stage, it makes me wonder does it mean that we are not compatible? Personally, I have issues setting boundaries and have personal baggage from previous relationship so I dont know if it’s a me issue or the relationship issue.

Thank you for your courage and openness to share what you are currently experiencing. I believe that your feelings of doubts and uncertainties in a new relationship are normal and fully understandable. I commend your presence of mind in taking your time to pause, reflect and acknowledge your feelings.
Some key points to consider which I believe would be helpful are:
2. Friends’ opinions: While their input is valuable, remember that ultimately, it’s your decision. However, I encourage you to ask them for specific reasons so that you can objectively assess your views. They may point out blind spots and that could help you obtain a new perspective.
3. Interests and compatibility: Shared interests are important, but not the only factor. Emotional connection, values, and communication are crucial.
4. Lovebombing: Reflect on your actions and ensure you’re not overwhelming him with affection due to your own uncertainty.
5. Communication: Address your concerns and feelings with him openly. Encourage him to share his thoughts and plans. Start small, and do it step by step.
6. Boundary issues and personal baggage: Recognize these as your own challenges and work on setting healthy boundaries.
7. Compatibility: Consider whether your differences and similarities create a harmonious balance.
Remember, relationships involve growth, compromise, and understanding. Take your time, prioritize open communication, and focus on building a connection based on mutual respect and trust.",,0,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—it’s not easy to open up about these things, and your feelings are completely valid. What you’re experiencing is very normal, and I’ve felt a lot of uncertainty in similar situations too. Relationships can be a mix of excitement and anxiety, and it’s okay to feel both.
It’s clear that you care deeply about your relationship, and it’s great that you’re being thoughtful about what you need and want. It’s okay to take your time and not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just letting things unfold at their own pace can help you figure out what feels right for you.
It’s also okay to feel unsure—relationships are complex, and it’s normal to have doubts. Keep talking things through with your friends and with him when you feel ready. You don’t have to rush anything. Taking it slow is perfectly fine, and it might give you the space you need to understand your feelings better.
Be gentle with yourself as you navigate this. You’re doing your best, and that’s something to be proud of. Trust yourself—you know what’s best for you.
Take care,
Tommy",,0,,,,,

Hi there,
Thank you for sharing what you’re going through—what you’re feeling is super valid. Job hunting can be incredibly overwhelming, and it’s completely okay to feel the way you do.
I’m also in the process of job searching, and I’ve struggled a lot with editing my resume. It took me 6 hours just to add three lines, so I totally get how daunting it can feel. The uncertainty and anxious self-doubt can be really tough to manage.
One thing that helped me was focusing on key contributions I’ve made in previous roles. Try to add in as many quantifiable numbers as possible to show the impact of your work. It might be helpful to take your time with it—if it takes a week or two, that’s okay. You could write a first version, even if it’s not perfect, and slowly revise it over a few days.
Remember, it’s a numbers game. Spend time slowly crafting your resume before applying to a lot of jobs at once. I once applied to over 100 jobs and only got interviews for 3 or 4 of them—this is very normal.
Take it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself. You’ve got this.
Best,
Tommy", https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/job-hunt-woes-not-my-first-time/15408/1,1,,24063,,,24063

Job hunting can be such a stressful and overwhelming process, and it’s okay to feel anxious about it. It sounds like you’re going through a tough time, and it’s important to be kind to yourself during this period.
Firstly, it’s great that you’re aware of your triggers. Recognizing what causes these feelings is a big step. It’s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time—editing your resume doesn’t have to be done all at once. Maybe try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.
It’s also important not to compare your journey with others’. Everyone’s path is different, and where others are at doesn’t define where you should be. Focus on being the best version of yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way, even if they feel insignificant to others.
Your mental health is a priority, so remember to lean on your support system and take care of yourself. It might also be worth considering talking to a counselor who can provide additional support and help you navigate through this challenging time.
You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to seek help when you need it. Hang in there, and take things one step at a time. You’ve got this!",,1,,,,,
15410,I think I am the problem in whichever relationship I get into,https://letstalk.mindline.sg/t/i-think-i-am-the-problem-in-whichever-relationship-i-get-into/15410,Seeking Help,needadvice,12553,Scott97,User,,24065,1,"As stated in the title. I feel like in whatever relationship I get into it doesn’t end well and it’s hurting me. In summary, had 3 failed relationships/dates and it sucks because I don’t even know what’s right and wrong. And I am not sure how to recover from this and address problems on my end (I feel upset about it, and at the same time I think there are some serious self-reflection and improvements I need to make, but I am not sure what exactly it is and where to start)
The longer story is that I had a past relationship where I felt neglected by someone I really cared about. But then I am not sure if it’s because I am too needy, selfish, and unresponsive to different ways of expressing love. And then in the next ones, I felt scared of voicing my own opinion because they may not like what I have to say. And in some cases, I have been told that I think of myself too highly of myself and expect a lot of validation (So it makes me suspect that I am narcissistic). I have also been told I am a passive-aggressive, and defensive person (I feel hurt hearing this because I meant to express my feelings, and my point of view. So it makes me feel like the right way to approach problems with people is just to lie about how I feel or keep quiet and accept the scolding I am getting). I also have been told that I am just a sweet talker and not a do-er (This makes me wonder if I am very ignorant and cant tell when is the right time to do the right thing.).
Another thing that upset me when I was in those relationships was that I felt like I needed to have a much bigger heart than the other party. When they do something that upsets me, I need to forgive, but when I do something wrong, I cannot expect others to extend the same kind of forgiveness and empathy towards me. So if I make a mistake, I need to be prepared to be scolded.
I have been told I play the victim card, but that is not my intention. I simply just want to be heard, be given the benefit of doubt to explain myself, and fix things. As I type all these, I am worried I sound like I am playing victim.
As I self-reflect, I think it stems from low self-esteem which translates to poor social skills, and insecurities which come across as being narcissistic, not being able to read the room, being sensitive to criticism, and being unable to speak directly (I use myself as a gauge on whether or not to say something or not, so if I am unable to take it, I will try to be less direct about it). I never intend to be the problem, and if I am, I really want to stop it.
But all these seem very overwhelming, and I am not sure what I should do to get out of this mess? Like first of all, how do I even know if my self-reflection is accurate? And then even if it is, how do I fix all of it? It has been about 2 years having these on and offs and I am frankly getting very exhausted and troubled.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for sharing what you’ve been going through—navigating relationships can be incredibly challenging, especially when you’re trying to make sense of your own feelings and behaviors. It’s clear that you’ve been doing a lot of self-reflection, which is a crucial step in understanding yourself better, but I also understand how overwhelming it can feel when you’re not sure if you’re on the right track.
First, I want to acknowledge that it’s okay to feel upset about how things have gone in your past relationships. It’s natural to want to figure out what went wrong and how to improve, but it’s important to approach this process with self-compassion. It’s easy to get caught up in self-criticism, especially when others have pointed out traits or behaviors that hurt you. But remember, the goal of self-reflection isn’t to tear yourself down—it’s to learn and grow.
It’s possible that some of what you’re feeling—like being too needy, passively aggressive, or sensitive to criticism—could stem from underlying insecurities or low self-esteem, as you mentioned. When we’re not feeling secure in ourselves, it can be hard to find the balance between expressing our needs and fears, and we might second-guess ourselves or worry about how others perceive us. It’s also possible that your desire to be heard and understood has been misunderstood by others, leading to feelings of being dismissed or scolded.
In relationships, communication is key, but it’s also a skill that takes time, patience, and guidance to develop. You mentioned feeling scared to voice your opinions and unsure of how to approach problems without being seen as playing the victim. This can be a tough place to be, but it doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong—it might just mean that you’re still learning how to navigate these complex interactions. It’s okay to be a work in progress.
One step that might help is to focus on building self-awareness in a way that’s constructive rather than critical. Ask yourself questions like, “What do I need in a relationship to feel secure?” or “How can I express my feelings in a way that feels true to me but also considers the other person’s perspective?” It can also be helpful to practice setting small, manageable goals for yourself—like being more direct in your communication or working on your response to criticism—rather than trying to fix everything at once.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, it might also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist who can guide you through this process. They can help you sort through these feelings, validate your experiences, and work on strategies for building healthier relationships with others and with yourself. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can make a big difference in understanding the patterns that are playing out in your relationships.
You’re clearly motivated to make positive changes, and that’s a powerful first step. It’s okay to take things one step at a time, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. Remember, growth is a journey, and you don’t have to figure it all out at once.
Take care, and be kind to yourself as you continue to navigate this path.",,2,,,,,

Thank you for reading and replying to me. It is helpful when you remind me of the healthier objectives of self-reflection, and listening to how I am feeling. I feel that it is easier said than done sometimes, especially with the self-esteem and insecurities I am feeling as they have manifested in different ways outside of my past relationship experiences such as school (when I don’t do well), work (When I get criticised, I sometimes assume to worst), and my personal thoughts when I face setbacks (E.g. I sometimes tie my setbacks to my self-worth). I am thinking of seeking help from a counsellor/therapist. How do I prepare for it?
Thanks for taking the time to read my follow-up question. I really appreciate the clarity and affirmation that I am on track in some way.",,1,,,,,

Thank you for your thoughtful follow-up! It’s great to hear that the previous advice was helpful to you, and I really appreciate your openness about the challenges you’re facing. It’s completely understandable that working through insecurities and self-esteem issues can feel overwhelming at times, especially when they show up in so many areas of life. You’re definitely not alone in feeling that way, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to not only reflect on these feelings but also to take the next step of seeking professional help.
When you mentioned how setbacks sometimes feel tied to your self-worth, I want to remind you that recognizing this pattern is already a step toward healing. It can be tough to separate failures or criticisms from how we see ourselves, but with the right support, you can start to break that link and view challenges more as opportunities for growth rather than reflections of your worth.
Since you’re thinking about seeing a counselor or therapist, I want to reassure you that it’s a great step, and preparation can help you make the most of the experience. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you prepare:
- Before your first session, take some time to think about what specific areas of your life you’d like help with. You’ve already mentioned things like self-esteem, insecurity, and tying setbacks to self-worth. Are there specific situations (like school, work, or relationships) where you feel these issues arise the most? Having a clear idea of what you want to work on can help guide the conversation with your therapist.
- Therapy is a process, and it takes time to see progress. It’s important to go into it knowing that healing and change won’t happen overnight, but each session is a step toward gaining more clarity and control over your thoughts and feelings. Be patient with yourself as you work through these deeper issues.
- The more honest and open you can be about how you’re feeling, the more helpful therapy will be. It’s okay to talk about the things that feel uncomfortable, like your insecurities or fear of being judged. Therapists are there to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts, so don’t be afraid to share how difficult self-reflection feels right now.
- Sometimes it’s hard to see progress when we’re in the middle of working through our thoughts and emotions. Try keeping a journal where you can jot down thoughts, feelings, and any breakthroughs you experience during therapy. Over time, you’ll start to notice patterns and improvements that will remind you how far you’ve come.
- Therapy often involves looking at how past experiences have shaped your current thinking patterns and behaviors. You’ve already made a connection between your past relationships and your current insecurities, so it might be helpful to reflect on other past events or experiences that could be influencing how you see yourself today. This will give your therapist more insight into where these feelings may be coming from.
- Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and healing. While it’s natural to want quick solutions, it’s also important to treat yourself with compassion along the way. If certain sessions feel tough, that’s okay—sometimes the hardest moments lead to the most growth.
I’m really glad that you’re taking steps toward improving your well-being, and I want to reassure you that asking for help is a sign of strength. You’ve already shown that you’re capable of self-reflection and growth, and therapy will give you the tools and support you need to take those next steps. Don’t be afraid to take things one session at a time—you’ve got this!
